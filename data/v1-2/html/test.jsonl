Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n  <i>\n   narl\n  </i>\n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Noork\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman\u2014and ugly, my son.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal\u2014gold, silver and brass\u2014vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped\u2014mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody.

Gurn has been exiled from their home city of Grath because he doesn't believe in the enslavement of the Zuran, and Tholon Sarna has recently evaded capture by her enemies, the men of Konto. The Misty Ones--slavers dwellling at the Temple of the Skull and feared deeply by the Vasads--follow her.

But Willard wasn't superstitions.\n  <br/>\n  He had seen the phantom\u2014and lived.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n  <i>\n   Mary\nLou\n  </i>\n  were now black as meteor dust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Saw what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's come\u2014for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n  <i>\n   It's come\u2014for me!\n  </i>\n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas\u2014ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Arden, Rocketport\n  </i>\n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou II\n  </i>\n  , in memory of his father.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n </p>\n <p>\n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n  <i>\n   through\n  </i>\n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND\u2014ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  behind him forever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  . His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had\nonce known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years\nof solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n  <i>\n   he knew\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n  <i>\n   Mary Lou\n  </i>\n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n  <i>\n   through\n  </i>\n  it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded.

Although the ship can still carry out functions to support life, it is not navigable. After Willard helps Dobbin look at the stars one more time, Dobbin cries out that it\u2019s true\u2014when an astronaut is dying, the Ghost Ship comes for him. \n\nWillard recycles Dobbin\u2019s body but feels regretful about it. He longs to see the Earth again and walk on it, but he knows this will never happen and feels intensely lonely. After two years, a strange thing happens. Willard is looking at the stars, and it seems that they are winking at him. Something seems to be moving toward him, and it turns out to be an ancient ship. Willard\u2019s gauges do not register the ship\u2019s presence although he sees it with his own eyes, and Willard realizes that it is the Ghost Ship coming for him. Strangely enough, however, the ship turns away and moves away from him.\n\nSeven years later, a newspaper on Earth publishes a story that Willard\u2019s son, J. Willard II, plans to build a larger version of his father\u2019s ship, the Mary Lou II, in memory of his father, but Willard Sr. is unaware of this. He continues to experience excruciating loneliness and dreams about his life on Earth\u2014the people he knew, the sounds, and the cities. One day a giant rocket ship comes alongside the Mary Lou, and Willard is thrilled that he has been discovered. But the vessel turns away and leaves. Willard notices that he can see starlight through the ship and realizes it is the Ghost Ship. \n\nOne day he sees another ship and, at first, fears the Ghost Ship has returned. The new ship looks solid, though, and it contacts him, addressing the Mary Lou by name. Willard believes that this ship will take him back to Earth and eagerly boards it. Willard is kept drugged for a while but eventually is alert enough to speak with the captain. When Willard asks when they will return to Earth, the captain explains that they cannot return because matter in space loses its mass and energy until nothing is left. If they tried to return to Earth, they would pass through it.

It steals dying spacemen who have no hope of returning to Earth, cursing them to spend the rest of their lives as ghosts in space. \nAfter Dobbin passes, Willard watches over him for two days before removing his body and turning it into energy for the useless engine in the Mary Lou. Although the ship is livable, it is not flyable. Taking careful diligence to check every part of the ship, Willard manages to keep the Mary Lou from completely shutting down. He transforms waste into food and learns to survive. \nTwo years of great loneliness and despair pass. As Willard looks out the port, he sees blinking stars. Excited, he investigates and realizes that it was an old-fashioned spaceship from decades ago. He soon sees that half of it is invisible, hence the blinking star phenomenon. As the ship gets closer, his sensors remain quiet. Putting it all together, he concludes that this is the Ghost Ship, but pushes the thought away, claiming it\u2019s impossible. Slowly, the ship turns around and travels away from him. \nFlash forward seven more years and a newspaper published a story about Willard and Dobbin on Earth. Sadly, he would never get to see it. Willard\u2019s son was about to create his own ship called Mary Lou II to honor his father. Willard spends his years alone trying to survive and also trying to fight off his memories of home, as they torture him. He kept up with the days and nights of Earth for many years and made his bed.

Another ship came and went, torturing him with hope yet again. \nAlmost twenty years passed and he grew more anguished every day. A ship came toward him and asked if he wanted to board, seeing as his ship was unlivable. Grateful he had checked the space suit beforehand, Willard traveled to the other ship and quickly fell into a deep sleep, exhausted by his years of solitude. After being drugged and evaded, Willard finally gets to speak to the captain of the ship on the third week who reveals that this is the Ghost Ship.

At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup\u2014\" he glanced at the paper\u2014\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Magnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You tell me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The police\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's behind it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At least not willingly....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n  <i>\n   Moss\nRock\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n  <i>\n   Moss Rock\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The youth gurgled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n  <i>\n   Moss Rock\n  </i>\n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\n  <i>\n   Lament of\nHatching\n  </i>\n  ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness.

Retief suggests researching the youth groups before giving them money. Magnan is dismissive. Retief is still not interested, and leaves to go look at plans for a new passenger liner being built by the Fustians. \nRetief takes a flat-car to the ship yard and meets Whonk, who is a shipyard clerk. He asks to see the blueprints, which he photographs. He and Whonk chat about the attitude of the youth, and Whonk blames it on their new leader, Slock, who hangs around with Yith, a member of the Groaci embassy.\nLater, while Retief is on his way home to dress for a dinner and press event organized by Magnan, two Fustian youths threaten him on the bus. Retief realizes that they were after his photos, which showed that the ship under construction was a battle cruiser, not a passenger liner. He also realizes that Whonk may be in danger. Retief escapes the youths and races back to the shipyard to find that Whonk has been dragged off and tied up in a warehouse. From the Fustian\u2019s wounds, Retief realized that they had tried to kill him.\nRetief figures out that the Fustian youths have taken some titanite, an explosive, over to a ship called the Moss Rock, which would be full of dignitaries later.

Retief, the Councillor, does not seem interested, and heads out to the shipyards to ask the people there some questions about a new ship being built. An older Fustian named Whonk allows him to see the plans for the ship and tells Retief about Slock, one of the local leaders of the Youths that seems to be a bad influence. These troublesome characters showed up to talk to Whonk and scare Retief off of the docks as Retief slips out unnoticed. He finds plans in the Embassy's library for an old battle cruiser that match the plans for the new ship, pointing him towards a plot to re-introduce weapons into the society. He finds Whonk, injured from the others' attempt to extract information from him, and the two of them piece together the clues: there was titanite, a dangerous explosive, that is going to be placed on the fanciest boat at the docks, the Moss Rock. When they get to that ship to take a look, they find a variety of items emblazoned with the logo of SCARS, the Youth Group that Ambassador Magnan wanted Retief to sponsor at the beginning. Retief figures that these items are here as planted false evidence, so that the explosion would be pinned on the Youth Group, and thus the Terrestrials by extension. Retief's goal is to destroy this plot--Whonk captures a Fustian who they realize has had his shell surgically removed, something that they thought impossible. Retief takes this to mean that the Groaci have more medical knowledge than they realized, and that they are responsible for this plot. In order to expose this plan, he heads to the banquet where the sponsorship of the Youth Group is being announced. He interrupts the Ambassador's grand announcement, exposing the plot to the press that was already gathered there. He knew Slock to be a gang leader, told everyone of the plan to blow up the Moss Rock and his deal with the Groaci, and then runs toward the boat with Whonk and the Ambassador. Whonk wanted to follow through with his society's classic ceremonial revenge against Yith, the Groaci at the ship, but Retief convinces them to have a sort of trade: Yith would share the medical knowledge to remove Whonk's heavy outer shell so that it would no longer be a nuisance and a heavyweight, and Slock is thrown onto the Moss Rock as it leaves the docks and explodes.

Instead, Retief prefers to investigate a new passenger ship being built by the Fustians. Upon his arrival at the shipyard, Retief meets Whonk, an elderly Fustian who maintains documents, and he shows Retief the blueprints for the new ship. A young Fustian named Slock enters and arouses Retief\u2019s suspicions by inquiring what he wants with the plans. After he leaves the shipyard, Retief is attacked by two young Fustians, and he returns to find Whonk has been attacked as well. Retief notices a stain on the ground that Whonk tells him is a remnant of four drums belonging to the Groaci\u2014an alien species that operated a competing embassy. Retief had seen interacting a Groaci attache interacting with the youth that had attacked him earlier. The drums had been loaded onto a boat called \"Moss Rock.\" After identifying the smelly stain as an explosive called titanite, Retief and Whonk go to \"Moss Rock\" and discover a box containing a SCARS uniform. While there, they are attacked by an older-looking youth Fustian and discover that he is not a youth at all; rather, his shell has been removed by some mysterious method. They ward off another attack by his friends, and Retief decides to head to the sponsorship ceremony, realizing that the Groaci are likely taking advantage of the SCARS group's distaste for Fustian leadership to advance their plot to bomb \"Moss Rock\". At the sponsorship ceremony, Ambassador Magnan introduces Slock as guest of honor, and Retief and Whonk seize the opportunity to apprehend him and explain his deal with the Groaci to the press: The Groaci would supply weapons, and Slock would make sure they were installed on the ship. The SCARS uniforms found at the scene of the exploded ship would implicate them along with the Terrestrial Embassy, because of its sponsorship of SCARS. Magnan notes that Slock was scheduled to be on the ship, and Retief rebuts that this reveals the Groaci's intention to get rid of Slock after he'd done their bidding. Thus, the disaster at \"Moss Rock\" would cement the Groaci's control of Fust. Retief returns to the \"Moss Rock\" and captures the Groaci diplomat Yith, and Whonk captures Slock, whom they both discover has also had his shell surgically removed to appear younger. Retief makes a deal with Whonk to spare Yith's life in exchange for the same shell-removal surgery.

He puts Slock on the Moss Rose with the titanite that Slock had intended to use against Fustian politicians, and sets the rocket to blast off to Groaci, knowing that it would below up before it got there. \nBut Retief manages to settle him down enough not to take Yith apart piece by piece, by getting the Groaci to do something that would make Whonk\u2019s life a lot easier and more pleasant: surgically remove his carapace. \nWhonk is steadfast, reliable, implacable \u2013 a good sidekick for Retief.\n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "33a99d27926948c09e8527c8a0863bcd", "response_text": "Whonk is the older Fustian who helps Retief uncover the Groacian plot.

The city of the story is also near a sea, whose breezes make it a bit cool at certain times of day.\nThe city where all the action takes place is an important city, perhaps the capitol. It is full of diplomatic missions from all planets, and is apparently a place of some Fustian learning and culture, given that it has musicians for hire. There is a space ship building operation right outside the city, which can be reached by public transport that consists of flat open wagons. This is practical for the unwieldy shape of the adult Fustian, if not too comfortable for a human.\nOne of the most interesting things about Fust, and the hardest for an outsider to understand, is their assorted suns and moons.

Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line\u2014in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause\u2014by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Bettijean crossed briskly to his desk. She gave him a motherly smile\nas she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said.\n\"Brass give you much trouble?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick,\nbrown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to\nhis wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a\nlittle time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks. Sit down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no\nfatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's\nspreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her\ndark eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,\u2014and a\nbunch more. No indication there. Except\"\u2014she fished out a one-page\nreport\u2014\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign\nfor everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today\nthey were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at\nthe polls. They've all got it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers,\nteachers, preachers\u2014rich, poor\u2014from Florida to Alaska. Just when you\ncalled me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated\nmountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too\nfragmentary.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly\nill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until\nthey have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of\nthe country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In food?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing\nplants over the country. How could they all goof at the same\ntime\u2014even if it was sabotage?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On the wind?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire\ncountry\u2014even Alaska and Hawaii\u2014without hitting Canada or Mexico? And\nwhy wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to\ngrip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ...\nwell, an enemy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her,\npunishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his\nhead, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of\npapers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've got to find a clue\u2014a trend\u2014an inkling of something.\" He\nnodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those\ngirls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country.\nHave them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up\nanother relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and\nsandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and\noccupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned\ndown to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and\nbroken lines pointed vaguely to trends.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  And from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, general, I\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report\u2014nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen\u2014not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had\u2014it was a\ncoded message the Reds'd tried to censor\u2014was an indication of\nsomething big in the works.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had\nan epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the\nduration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the\nsergeant and the corporal here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom? I'm assigned\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general snorted. \"Insubordination cannot be tolerated\u2014unless you\nfind a two-star general to outrank me. Now, as I said before, let's\nget out of here and let these people work.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  The brass exited wordlessly. Bettijean sighed noisily. Andy found his\ncigarette dead and lit another. He fancied a tiny lever in his brain\nand he shifted gears to direct his thinking back into the proper\nchannel. Abruptly his fatigue began to lift. He picked up the new pile\nof reports Bettijean had brought in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She move around the desk and sat, noting the phone book he had used,\nstudying the names he had crossed off. \"Did you learn anything?\" she\nasked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy coughed, trying to clear his raw throat. \"It's crazy,\" he said.\n\"From the Senate and House on down, I haven't found a single\ngovernment worker sick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I found a few,\" she said. \"Over in a Virginia hospital.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I did find,\" Andy said, flipping through pages of his own\nscrawl, \"a society matron and her social secretary, a whole flock of\noffice workers\u2014business, not government\u2014and new parents and newly\nengaged girls and....\" He shrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you notice anything significant about those office workers?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy nodded. \"I was going to ask you the same, since I was just\nguessing. I hadn't had time to check it out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I checked some. Practically none of my victims came from big\noffices, either business or industry. They were all out of one and\ntwo-girl offices or small businesses.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That was my guess. And do you know that I didn't find a doctor,\ndentist or attorney?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nor a single postal worker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy tried to smile. \"One thing we do know. It's not a communicable\nthing. Thank heaven for\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He broke off as a cute blonde entered and put stacks of reports before\nboth Andy and Bettijean. The girl hesitated, fidgeting, fingers to her\nteeth. Then, without speaking, she hurried out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy stared at the top sheet and groaned. \"This may be something. Half\nthe adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What?\" Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. \"It's the same\nthing\u2014only not quite as severe\u2014in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Writers?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mostly. Some artists, too, and musicians. And poets are among the\nhard hit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is insane,\" Andy muttered. \"Doctors and dentists are\nfine\u2014writers and poets are sick. Make sense out of that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean held up a paper and managed a confused smile. \"Here's a\ncountry doctor in Tennessee. He doesn't even know what it's all about.\nNobody's sick in his valley.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Somebody in our outer office is organized,\" Andy said, pulling at his\ncigarette. \"Here're reports from a dozen military installations all\nlumped together.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What does it show?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Black-out. By order of somebody higher up\u2014no medical releases. Must\nmean they've got it.\" He scratched the growing stubble on his chin.\n\"If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the\nfirst hit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" Bettijean brightened, then sobered. \"Maybe not. The brass\ncould keep it secret if an epidemic hit an army camp. And they could\nslap a control condition on any military area. But the panic will come\nfrom the general public.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here's another batch,\" Andy said. \"Small college towns under\ntwenty-five thousand population. All hard hit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, it's not split intellectually. Small colleges and small offices\nand writers get it. Doctors don't and dentists don't. But we can't\ntell who's got it on the military bases.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And it's not geographical. Look, remember those two reports from\nTennessee? That place where they voted on water bonds or something,\neverybody had it. But the country doctor in another section hadn't\neven heard of it.\" Andy could only shake his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean heaved herself up from the chair and trudged back to the\nouter office. She returned momentarily with a tray of food. Putting a\npaper cup of coffee and a sandwich in front of Andy, she sat down and\nnibbled at her snack like an exhausted chipmunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy banged a fist at his desk again. Coffee splashed over the rim of\nhis cup onto the clutter of papers. \"It's here,\" he said angrily.\n\"It's here somewhere, but we can't find it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The answer?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course. What is it that girls in small offices do or eat or drink\nor wear that girls in large offices don't do or eat or drink or wear?\nWhat do writers and doctors do differently? Or poets and dentists?\nWhat are we missing? What\u2014\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But ... but....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The technician darted out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  It was Bettijean who squeezed into the office and broke the brittle\nsilence. \"Andy, for heaven's sake, what is it?\" Then she moved around\nthe desk to stand behind him as he faced the officers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you got something?\" the brigadier asked. \"Some girl outside was\nbabbling about writers and doctors, and dentists and college students,\nand little secretaries and big secretaries. Have you established a\ntrend?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy glanced at the lab report and his smile was as relieved as it was\nweary. \"Our problem,\" he said, \"was in figuring out what a writer does\nthat a doctor doesn't\u2014why girls from small offices were sick\u2014and why\nsenators and postal workers weren't\u2014why college students caught the\nbug and people in a Tennessee community didn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The lab report isn't complete.

But\"\u2014he held up a four-cent\nstamp\u2014\"here's the villain, gentlemen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The big brass stood stunned and shocked. Mouths flapped open and eyes\nbugged at Andy, at the stamp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean said, \"Sure. College kids and engaged girls and new parents\nand especially writers and artists and poets\u2014they'd all lick lots of\nstamps. Professional men have secretaries. Big offices have\npostage-meter machines. And government offices have free franking.\nAnd\"\u2014she threw her arms around the sergeant's neck\u2014\"Andy, you're\nwonderful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The old American ingenuity,\" the colonel said, reaching for Andy's\nphone. \"I knew we could lick it. Now all we have to do\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At ease, colonel,\" the brigadier said sharply. He waited until the\ncolonel had retreated, then addressed Andy. \"It's your show. What do\nyou suggest?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get somebody\u2014maybe even the President\u2014on all radio and TV networks.\nExplain frankly about the four-centers and warn against licking any\nstamps. Then\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He broke off as his phone rang. Answering, he listened for a moment,\nthen hung up and said, \"But before the big announcement, get somebody\nchecking on the security clearances at whatever plant it is where they\nprint stamps. This's a big deal. Somebody may've been planted years\nago for this operation. It shouldn't be too hard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But there's no evidence it was a plot yet.

The antidote's simple and the cure should be\nquick. They can phone or broadcast the medical information to doctors.\nThe man on the phone said they could start emptying hospitals in six\nhours. And maybe we should release some propaganda. \"United States\nwhips mystery virus,\" or something like that. And we could send the\nKremlin a stamp collection and.... Aw, you take it, sir. I'm pooped.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  The general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into\nthe corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling\nhis granite brow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Andy chucked. \"That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk\nlick a stamp? They always use a sponge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and\nthe grin became a rumbling laugh. \"How would you two like a thirty-day\nfurlough to rest up\u2014or to get better acquainted?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And while you're gone,\" the general continued, \"I'll see what strings\nI can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions,\nI'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to\npin on the bars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of\nfurlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the\ndepths of each other's eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent\nstamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the\nstamp out of the office under guard.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  THE END\n </h3>\n <hr style=\"width: 65%;\"/>\n \n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "6", "uid": "f39544b36fbe436cbfaf23794ebf9a57", "response_text": "The Plague takes place in the modern United States of America. The story follows several government workers as they navigate a sudden and mysterious epidemic. Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud, mostly referred to as Andy, works at the Office of the Civil Health and Germ Welfare Protection located in the Pentagon. Corporal Bettijean Baker, his right-hand woman and new lover, picks up the phone one day, and then chaos ensues. \nA switchboard is put in the hallway to help receive the hundreds of calls being made to their office. This sudden influx of calls, attention, people, and disease leave the main characters feeling overwhelmed and desperate. \nSince the new lieutenant had not arrived (post Colonel Patterson\u2019s retirement), Sergeant Andy is effectively in charge as a noncom, though not everyone is happy about that. Andy pushes their worries aside, and continues working. \nDespite the spread, no fatalities have been reported, and infections are random. No trend has been established yet, but they are searching desperately for one. Bettijean goes through reports with Sergeant Andy, revealing all she\u2019s uncovered. It\u2019s affecting workers, artists, and poets, but not necessarily those who work in government, or as doctors or businessmen. The water systems are ruled out, as well as wind and food. Bettijean and Andy are left with nothing, except the possibility of biological terrorism. \nFinally, Andy orders Bettijean to halt all in-coming calls, and redirect their attention to all hospitals. \nDespite their best efforts, no conclusion can be reached. The colonel reappears in Andy\u2019s office, followed by two officers. He throws a newspaper down on his desk, proclaiming that this epidemic was allegedly caused by the Russians, and that all the authorities are baffled. It is hinted that the Colonel commissioned this article to throw doubt on Andy\u2019s authority. Andy defends his employees and the work they\u2019ve been doing. The Colonel forces Andy and Bettijean out of office, and Andy lets him, kissing Bettijean on the way out. Suddenly, the general walks in and gives Andy back his job, while telling him the news from Intelligence. The Iron Curtain\u2019s not sent word for almost two days. Only a coded message that could have been about the epidemic. \nAndy promises to work hard again, and the general assigns the colonel and his two men to the switchboard in the hall. After brainstorming about potential causes, Janis, another employee, enters the room and puts another stack of reports down. Small college towns, newly engaged girls, poets, all these people have been infected. Janis falls to the floor, and everyone rushes to her. She\u2019s been infected with the disease, and they question her about her activities for the past 12 hours. It\u2019s revealed finally that she wrote a letter to her mother, and Andy finally figures it out. The poison was in the stamps. He lets his higher-ups know, and Janis is carted off to safety.

As he waits for a replacement, his superior officers nervously warn him about an epidemic that they don\u2019t understand yet, that Andy will be in charge of the response for. Corporal Bettijean Baker is Andy\u2019s assistant, in this previously under-the-radar department that is all of a sudden the most important aspect of the nation\u2019s response. Andy and Bettijean work through reports together to look for a trend, hoping to find how the epidemic is spreading. It seems to be affecting only the United States of America, without affecting Canada even though it has reached Alaska. The dumbfounded officers decide to learn more about the people who have fallen sick. When Bettijean returned with more reports, two other officers came into Andy\u2019s office to show him the headlines: the public panic had started, two days after the office had stopped sleeping to find the root of the issue. The colonel doesn\u2019t appreciate the lack of military formality in the way that Andy and Bettijean are taking, and he angrily orders them to be disciplined before the general interrupts. The general gestures to Andy and Bettijean to continue their work, and sat down with them to talk solemnly. There\u2019s some suspicion about the Soviet Union\u2019s involvement. Recognizing Andy\u2019s need for manpower, the general assigns the very unhappy colonel to report to Andy and Bettijean for as long as the epidemic is going on. Lighting a new cigarette, Andy gets back to work. The team found evidence of small business workers being sick, but no government workers (outside of some in a hospital), no doctors, and no postal workers. They take this as evidence that it\u2019s not communicable, but they find some cities are more affected than others. Writers, poets, artists, and musicians in cities that are often vacation spots are hit hard, along with small college towns. They are interrupted by screams outside their door when Janis falls sick. When she\u2019s able to talk, Andy asks Janis questions about the past twelve hours. She had written and mailed a letter to her mother about the epidemic, but nothing else seemed out of place. Andy pondered over another cigarette as the doctor saw to Janis. Andy suddenly had an idea, frantically searched for Janis\u2019 purse, and handed one of her postage stamps to a lab technician. His hunch was right: the stamp was the problem, licking the glue was how people got sick. Andy starts on a plan to notify the public of the issue, and to investigate the source of the poison in the stamps. The lab was able to identify the toxin, and it would be simple to treat.

The two of them had been analyzing the reports and statistics for several hours now, desperate to find a trend amongst those infected.

Lewis\n </h2>\n <p class=\"hd1\">\n  Illustrated by KELLY FREAS\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  Herbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  He let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Herbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him\u2014his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name\u2014streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  The dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses\u2014monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor\u2014had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  He looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before\u2014a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself\u2014and complete consciousness\u2014back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n </p>\n <p>\n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms.

The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His heart sank.

Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Deep depression laid hold of\nhim.

Someone\nelse would have her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unless ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's\u2014let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom?

The husband, Herbert Hyrel, figures she is watching a sex-opera as her escapist entertainment of choice, and waits a few minutes to start his own entertainment. As we waits, he considers his anger towards his wife: he no longer resented the time she spent not talking to him, while utilizing her telovis, but he did hate that she controlled the purse-strings in the household and gave him a small allowance. His anger had been pent up for some time, enough that he wanted to kill his wife, but for now he was satisfied with the idea of killing her. Once enough time had passed, he flicked a switch on the teleporter suit he was wearing and a version of his body appeared in a cabin in the woods that he was renting, where he had left himself a fresh outfit. He headed to the Riverside Club where he hoped to encounter a woman he had met recently, and when he got there he sat down and drank some cheap whiskey. He encountered a costumed woman who teased him, pulled away to dance with someone else, but came back to dance with him once the man she was with disappeared.  This man had flipped the switch on his suit, disappearing and leaving behind a pile of clothes, presumably because he would have been discovered wherever his original body was. As Herbert danced and moved outside, he spotted the woman he had been looking for, wearing a suggestive costume and a platinum wig, her body and her purse all covered in jewels. She asked him for champagne, which he was upset about because he did not have much money, but he obliged and tried to move the night forward after he had had something to drink. Again, though, she requested he spend more money on her--this time, for a private room at the club so they did not have to be outside. She said she was asking him to prove to her that she could be spoiled, but this pressure reminded him how angry he was that he had to spend the little money he had trying to escape from his wife, budgeting in a way that limited his nights out just to have some privacy. He started yelling about how he would have more money soon, and eventually admitted that he would kill his wife to get it. Hearing this, the woman he was with pulled a gun out of her purse and shot him--it was his wife all along. The scene jumps back to the house, where the wife pulls off her telovis set, smugly turns off her husband's teleporter suit, and watches him gasp for air and die. She called the police to call for a doctor, hid her own teleporter suit, and waited for the police to show."}, {"worker_id": "6", "uid": "4b34365346fa457f9cb8c10219add055", "response_text": "Herbert Hyrel finds himself in a loveless and difficult marriage. His wife has withdrawn herself, sticking to her televois or 3-D TV, and only gives him a monthly allowance. Her generational wealth makes him feel emasculated and weak, which only strengthens his hatred for her. Hyrel has recently invested in a teleporter suit, one that took him six months of saving to put the down payment on. This suit allows him to leave his corporeal body and travel to a shadow realm, where his conscious spirit can roam free. He uses this to drink, party, meet women, and escape from his wife and true reality. \nHe\u2019s looking forward to traveling again, because of the woman he met last time in the flapper outfit. He hopes that this night will be the night she gives herself to him. After soaking in the wonderful thoughts of murdering his wife--which he plans to do as soon as the thought no longer brings him joy--Hyrel flicks the switch on his teleporter suit and arrives naked in a small cabin. Quickly, he changes into his cheap satin suit and makes his way to Riverside Club by taking the bus and walking. Once there, he orders a bottle of cheap whiskey, thanks to his depleting funds, and watches the masked dancers around him. A woman in a Persian-themed costume kisses him on the cheek but leaves him for another man. That man suddenly disappears, leaving only his costume behind. Hyrel reveals that those who get hurt in the shadow realm carry the hurt back with them in the real world. For example, he cut his hand in Riverside Club, and the pain traveled with him, but not the scar. \nThe Persian dancer joins him again, and they start to leave the club.

Herbert despises the way his wife looks at him, and he imagines her denigrating him as a gold-digger with nothing to offer a woman, so he privately purchases a telporter suit--a thin, mesh body cover that can be worn under one's clothes and is used to transport the wearer's \"shadowy self\" to a receiver previously set in secret. While he believes his wife is watching a sex-opera using her telovis (a 3-D imaging device), Herbert engages the telporter and transports himself to a cabin situated between a highway and a river. There, he changes clothes and walks to the Riverside Club (a place where owners of telporter suits can gather to escape their dreary outer lives) where he plans to meet a girl he had met the previous night. Because telporting oneself is illegal, rooms at the club are very expensive in order to cover the costs of police protection and Herbert cannot afford a private room there with the allowance his wife gives him. The club is colorful and full of costumed, masked partyers, dancing together and drinking champagne. Herbert purchases a bottle of whiskey because he cannot afford the expensive champagne. As Herbert drinks, he becomes more relaxed and confident, and he watches a woman dressed in a Persian costume dancing with a man dressed as a bullfighter. Soon after, the bullfighter disappears, and Herbert is reminded that sometimes people at the club vanish suddenly when there is a threat they will be discovered in their outer lives. He also notices a scar on his hand and is reminded that when someone's shadow self is injured, their outer husk retains the feeling of pain but not the scar. Herbert dances with the Persian-costumed woman and becomes steadily more intoxicated by drink and by the atmosphere of revelry. Eventually, he finds the girl he had met the night before, recognizing her by her long, stockinged legs. She wears a platinum wig, a white mask, and green contact lenses, and they dance together and kiss. The drunker Herbert becomes, the more insecure he feels about his ability to satisfy the woman, and he begins lashing out at her, accidentally revealing his plans to kill his wife in order to take her money so he can start a new life with the mysterious woman. The woman laughs at him, and she withdraws a gun from her purse and shoots Herbert twice--once in the heart and then in the head. The woman is actually Mrs. Herbert Hyrel, and she has been using her own telporter suit to expose Herbert and dispose of him herself.

Every night, she puts on her telovis for about three hours. Herbert thinks she is watching black-market sex-operas. Once she is caught up in the program, he uses his teleporter suit to escape to the Riverside Club. This is an exclusive club for people with teleporter suits, money, and a desire for self-abandonment. People go there to escape their boring, unpleasant lives and wear costumes to hide their identities while they engage in drunken, sexually-abandoned activities.

His anger increases as he works on a plan to get away from her, as he spends what little he has to maintain access to the Riverside Club, paying rent on a cabin, buying a teleporter suit, and similar expenses. He is finally pushed to make the choice to finally want to kill her when he finds he does not have the spending money to be able to buy nice drinks or private rooms for himself and the woman he meets at the club, who turns out to be his wife.

His resentment of his wife grew into hatred. Herbert does not have money of his own; his wife has money and gives him a \u201cpaltry\u201d allowance as if he were a child.

Both Herbert and his wife own one, though we don't learn that his wife has one until the end of the story. For Herbert, the teleporter suit is his ticket to spend time outside of the house that he feels trapped in, in a relationship that he is not happy in.

At the same time, it is these suits that allowed his wife to follow him to the club and convince him to admit his plans, eventually ending in his death.

The suits are made of a thin mesh that fits the body like a stocking and can be worn underneath one's clothes. The telporter can be engaged by flicking a small switch, and it sends its wearer to a receiver at a previously-set location. Herbert installs his receiver at a small cabin in the woods a short distance away from the Riverside Club since he cannot afford the private rooms there. Herbert does not understand the mechanics behind the suit, but he grasps its basic function--the suits transport a person's \"shadowy self\" from one's body and the body is left in \"a conscious but dream-like state.\" When the shadowy self returns, the body does not retain any scars the shadowy self may have sustained but it does feel the pain of those injuries.

For a moment, the\neffect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of\ncivilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks\nso short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a\nfanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Butch yawned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy\u2014and you, too, Hal\u2014when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen\u2014and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj\u2014it's contraprogrammed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's a garbage pail?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aw,\n  <i>\n   quit\n  </i>\n  it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I mean if you\n  <i>\n   could\n  </i>\n  hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup\u2014I want to think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  didn't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've never been inside the Time Theater\u2014you're not old enough\nyet\u2014so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep\n  <i>\n   telling\n  </i>\n  me about it, do you?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Butch scowled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it\u2014Butcher?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking\nand quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor\nhemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would\nbe nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the\nsimplest way to make progress.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were\namong the most prized of toys.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\n  <i>\n   know\n  </i>\n  ,\" the Butcher said irritably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale. It should be interesting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A\nred-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They won't let me in, either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier\u2014like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to\nthink old.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives\nsimply aren't allowed in the Time Theater. There's a good reason for\nit\u2014something dangerous might happen if an under-five got inside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't exactly know, but something.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hah! I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and\nhave some excitement.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They are not. I guess they just know you'd get bored and wander away\nfrom your seats and maybe disturb the adults or upset the electronics\nor something. But don't worry about it, Butcher. The usher will take\ncare of you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up\u2014I'm thinking I'm World Director,\" the Butcher informed them,\ncontorting his face diabolically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal spoke to the uninjes, pointing to the side of the corridor.\nObediently four of them lined up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Brute was peering down the corridor toward where it merged into a\ndeeper darkness. His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back.\nThe Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  But the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and\nthen sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and\ngrowled faintly down the corridor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think\nTamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the\nusher as if it weren't there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips.\nThere were two closely spaced faint\n  <i>\n   plops\n  </i>\n  and a large green stain\nappeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from\nthe close-cropped hair of the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms\nfolded and wasn't looking at them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the\nmain entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found\nthemselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch\nthe show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their\nlevitators, laid them on the floor and sat down.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central\nplatform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat\nflattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the\nbubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale\ncentral glow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of\nthe boys.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the\nbubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage\nappeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble,\na ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a\nlittle fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about\nwere wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond\nbeards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here and there were scattered weapons and armor\u2014long swords glistening\nwith oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and\nhelmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean,\nwolflike dogs paced with restless monotony.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Sometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway\u2014for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped\u2014and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why\u2014er\u2014you see, Joggy\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  As if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while\nmopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble,\nif the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward\nus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light\ncoming our way disappear, too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well\u2014you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once more the interpreter helped him out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms of\none element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It's\nmore than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of light\ntends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the\nlight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.\nBut one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the\nTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,\nyou haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're\ngetting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, no\nisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are\nbeing made to synthesize them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs\nare always angling for them. Apple-polishers!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  like this show,\" a familiar voice announced serenely. \"They cut\nanybody yet with those choppers?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal looked down beside him. \"Butch! How did you manage to get in?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  you get in\u2014Butcher?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse\u2014I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again\u2014so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher. I really\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  heard it's dangerous\nfor you under-fives to be in here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls\ncommented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew\nto the far end of the cubicle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on\nthe scene in the Time Bubble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those big dogs\u2014\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble.\nSmells haven't any isotopes and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out\nsomeday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's\nall the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real\nat all, but a\u2014uh\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking\nof the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is\nonly a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used\nfor time traveling\u2014just as it may be a similar disability that keeps\na robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real\nman or animal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and\nother beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time\nTheater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should\nprove true\u2014and no evidence for it has ever appeared\u2014there are\nautomatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any\nharmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible,\nremember) in either direction.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"You're rather young to be here, aren't you?\" the interpreter inquired.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The Butcher folded his arms and scowled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The interpreter hesitated almost humanly, probably snatching through a\nquarter-million microtapes. \"Well, you wouldn't have got in unless a\nqualified adult had certified you as plus-age. Enjoy yourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble\nhad acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up\ntheir swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back,\nrevealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be\nlooking straight out of the bubble at the future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is getting good,\" the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of\nhis seat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop being an impulsive mentality,\" Hal warned him a little nervously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hah!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of\nsmoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved\nwildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The\nwarriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the\nsorcerer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" the Butcher approved loudly. \"Sock it to 'em!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Butcher!\" Hal admonished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly the bubble grew very bright, as if the Sun had just shone\nforth in the ancient world, though the rain still dripped down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A viewing anomaly has occurred,\" the interpreter announced. \"It may be\nnecessary to collapse the Time Bubble for a short period.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a frenzy, his ragged robes twisting like smoke, the sorcerer rushed\nat one of the warriors, pushing him backward so that in a moment he\nmust cross-section.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Attaboy!\" the Butcher encouraged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the\nshadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh,\n  <i>\n   boy\n  </i>\n  !\" the Butcher cheered in ecstasy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Butcher, you've done it!\" Hal said, aghast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I sure did,\" the Butcher agreed blandly, \"but that old guy in the\nbubble helped me. Must take two to work it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep your seats!\" the interpreter said loudly. \"We are energizing the\nsafeguards!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the\none who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about,\npushing them in his direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged\nfrom the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row\nof the audience.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step\nforward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his\nleft shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his\nright hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\"\nthe interpreter enjoined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the\nButcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the\nfloor and darted out through the sphincter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged\nwarriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between\ntheir legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled.\nThen the warriors began to fan out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the\ninterpreter said. \"Please be patient.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a\nlevitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At\nhis heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization\nvoice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey,\nyou! You quit that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to\nquiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his\nsword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.\nThen his sword swished down in a flashing arc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring\nat him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible\nan arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed\na step.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and\ndigging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic\n'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie\nand Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Growling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves\nforward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first\nencounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and\ntossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But\nthen Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight\u2014and suddenly the\nface of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and\ntouched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But\nalready the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had\nthe advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many\nfoxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj\nclamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the\nwarriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully.\nThat was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand\nclenching the levitator above his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately,\na half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in\nmechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than\nflesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They\ncame yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle.\nHe dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a\nscreech.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the\nButcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew\nback, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs.\nAt their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time\nBubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted\nno time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and\nno repulsor field stayed them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "3", "uid": "9e0f89730bcc49cda54b41c868e77bae", "response_text": "The story starts in a park, where we meet a a young boy who goes by the Butcher (\"Butch\"), and his dog Brute. The boy is trying to do something to the dog with a small metal tube when Hal, another boy, shows up with his own dogs, and another boy named Joggy. It turns out these are not normal dogs, but are \"uninj\", machines created to be like dogs but not able to be hurt. Butch seems bored with these countermeasures against violence, and intent on putting violence back in the world. His interactions with Hal show us that they live in a civilization where the children are given opportunities to work out any violent and angry tendencies or impulses before they are conditioned as adults. They are only allowed to visit the Time Theater to see glimpses into other societies (and thus evidence of violence) after age five, and the change in mentality happens at age six. Butch wants to use Time Bubble to travel through time, but Hal insists that this is impossible. The boys head to this theater, an incredible crystal building with an important place in this society, choosing to fly there with their hover technology. Joggy is five, so he is allowed to enter with Hal, but Butch is blocked from entering by the ushers, which Hal says is for his own protection. Joggy and Hal take a seat in a children's viewing area to look into the glowing orb of light that sits in the middle of the round theater. The orb acts as a viewport into various times and places, and is currently showing a view of Earth, Scandanavia more specifically, around year zero according to Earth calendars. There are a number of warriors in the forest scene, along with some dogs and a sorcerer, and the boys watch in earnest. As the electronic interpreter for the viewing gives the boys more information about cultural context, Butch manages to sneak in to the theater by lying to the ushers. Shortly after Butch and two young girls join the viewing, something happened that no-one thought possible: the sorcerer pushed one of the warriors through the orb of the Time Bubble, throwing him into the theater. Panic falls on the audience, and warriors and dogs continue to enter the theater as Butch and the uninjes start to fight off the time-travelers with their design keeping them from being injured. Hal is convinced that this happened because an under-five (Butch specifically) was in the theater, but the rest of the public does not know he is young and they thank him for saving the day as he fights off the warriors and the Time Bubble collapses. This is the first piece of chaos the adults have experienced in their adult lives, and the Butcher is content with how it all played out, getting to play hero in a violent setting for a day with Brute."}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "62156a7e25a64fc5b923da6bdb072da9", "response_text": "Brute, a dog made of hyperplastic, barks without making a noise.

Butch then orders all of the dogs to fight, but becomes bored moments later. He tells his friends, Joggy and Hal that he wishes he lived like Huckleberry Finn, with the ability to get dirty and inflict pain.\n\nButch says that one day he will be the World Director, and he will bring back war. Hal, who is older and more mature, explains that Butch\u2019s desire for violence will be conditioned out of him once he turns six.

They watch Scandinavian warriors holding long swords, surrounded by dogs, listening to a hooded figure chant.\nJoggy has several questions about the show, and the interpreter in the room answers them.

Hal blames the anomaly on Butch. \nOne of the warriors grabs a woman in the front row and picks her up. Butch refuses to sit by idly and approaches the warrior with his levitator over his head. When the warrior tries to strike Butch with his sword, he finds that the boy is protected by an invisible shield. Butch commands the uninjes to attack the warriors and their dogs, and they do. The warriors are scared of the uninjes\u2019 strength and their ability to withstand their swords. The warriors\u2019 leader commands them to get back in the Time Bubble. The Interpreter explains that he must collapse the Bubble due to this crisis. The woman who was taken by the warrior hugs and kisses Butch for saving her life.

They have been programmed against it. This is just one element in a post-violence world; adults have been systemically programmed against using violence to resolve conflicts between themselves, although they may use it to fight against alien enemies.

His friend Hal assures him that when he is older, he will understand why removing violence from society was \"Man's greatest achievement.\" The boys make their way to the Time Theater at the end of the Avenue of Wisdom by utilizing levitators that help them swim through the air. The Time Theater is home to a large bubble that functions as a one-way viewer into pre-civilization eras. Only people over five years old are allowed into the Time Theater; the Butcher is stopped by an invisible \"usher\", leaving Hal and Joggy to enter the viewing cubicle alone. Once inside, the bubble interpreter and Hal explain to Joggy how the bubble functions. It is essentially a time-hole that allows observation because of light isotopes that leak through. But matter cannot pass through the bubble, which is why it cannot be used for time travel. However, some scientists theorize that people with impulsive minds, such as underage children, might activate a time-traveling capability. The Butcher tricks an adult into carrying him into the Time Theater, and he joins Joggy and Hal in their viewing of a group of barbaric Scandinavian men from the Dawn Era. They watch as a sorcerer conducts some kind of spell with the Butcher egging him on. The Butcher's impulsive behavior combined with the sorcerer's ability to see into the future unlocks the bubble, and the sorcerer pushes the Scandinavian men through into the Time Theater. There, they begin to attack the adults present and attempt to kidnap a woman in the audience. The Butcher commands the uninjes to attack the men, and he stuns them with his use of the levitator to protect his head from the blows of their swords.

The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd was startled by the nod.

Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder.

Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him.

For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\nhe had ever known\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\nalmost frighteningly black.

I'd like to talk to you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\ndistinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Huh?\n  </i>\n  Why, yeh\u2014I guess so\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\n  <i>\n   meloderge\n  </i>\n  that was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And why, Ryd?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\n  <i>\n   then\n  </i>\n  , but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n  <i>\n   Do you?\n  </i>\n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n  <i>\n   slaves\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  to do about it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't do that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   We\n  </i>\n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n  <i>\n   We\n  </i>\n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n  <i>\n   We\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n </p>\n <p>\n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rest of the way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n  <i>\n   Shahrazad\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n  <i>\n   run, run\n  </i>\n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\n  <i>\n   Shahrazad\n  </i>\n  , panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\n  <i>\n   Shahrazad\n  </i>\n  when she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where else?\" said Mury.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\u2014as it came\nabout\u2014just a little too late.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\n  <i>\n   Shahrazad's\n  </i>\n  airlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\" he inquired frostily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted\nthe tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused,\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\npointing at its licensed owner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard\nwith us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\u2014for he was still very\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Above, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing happened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up,\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Mury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\n  <i>\n   ex officio\n  </i>\n  the brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  think?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yet Arliess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Shahrazad\n  </i>\n  drove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more.

Burshis, the owner of the bar, gives Ryd a free drink and explains that a ship from Mars just brought power back.

Ryd is not easily convinced of this good news. \nThe ugly and tall man sitting next to Ryd recognizes him. Once outside, Mury introduces himself and asks Ryd if he wants to make some money.

Mury says that he is working for the hundreds of men who have been put out by the corrupt government on Mars. Although Ryd and all the other Earthmen have been told that the new power cylinder being installed will create jobs and bring back the power, Mury argues that isn\u2019t truly the case.

At one point, Dynamopolis was a wealthy city, known as the Port of Ten Thousand Ships. About ten years ago, the Power Company of North America and the Triplanet Freighting Company were shut down, and the majority of the Terrestrials lost their jobs. The only people with political power are the Poligerents, and unless a Terrestrial knows one of them, he or she is likely left without a way to make ends meet. The Terrestrials were recently told that the power will be restored once the power shell is put on Earth. The air is thin, but the Terrestrials have become accustomed to it.\n\nPi Mesa is the spaceport that hovers over the city. There are still unused ships hovering there from the days where it was an important port with lots of action. Just outside of Pi Mesa there are hundreds of low buildings that are abandoned because they are no longer useful. They contain fuel pumps and servicing equipment, and they serve as a constant reminder of the life the Terrestrials once lived. \n\nWhen Ryd and Mury break into the land patrolled by the guards in blue in the spaceport, they find narrow passages, spiral staircases, and cool metal walls covered in dust. The Communications Tower is nearby, and it is guarded by signal-men.  The soldier robots that are on patrol are about as tall as the average Terrestrial, and they are scarlet colored. They are unarmed and are mostly there to scare intruders away. \n\nMury and Ryd aim to get on a ship called Shahrazad, which rests on the Number Two Runway, waiting for takeoff.

There is a curved control panel in front, and the ship makes a humming sound because of all of the air-purifiers onboard. \n\nMars is an important setting in the story, although the characters do not actually travel there.

Earth wanted no\n  <br/>\n  \"shotgun weddings\" of the worlds of space!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Split\" Campbell and I brought our ship down to a quiet landing on the\nsummit of a mile-wide naked rock, and I turned to the telescope for a\ncloser view of the strange thing we had come to see.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It shone, eighteen or twenty miles away, in the light of the late\nafternoon sun. It was a long silvery serpent-like\n  <b>\n   something\n  </b>\n  that\ncrawled slowly over the planet's surface.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It\nmight have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain\u2014or a chain\nof mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had\nshaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow\ntube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their\nskyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along\nthe surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of\nsolid substance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from\nthis distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course\nfor centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn\npath between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the\nhorizon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   What was it?\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers.\nOur sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good\nWill Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first\nexpedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important\npieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned)\nhad brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts\nof the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this\nplanet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and\n(2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land,\ncontinuously, endlessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance\nfrom the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred\nnot to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly\nvibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it\nproved to be some sort of vegetable\u2014a vine of glacier proportions\u2014or\na river of some silvery, creamy substance\u2014we would move in upon it\ngradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon\n\"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of\nsplit-hairs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn\neagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare\nyoung Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Before I finish the reports, sir? If I recall our Code, Section Two,\nOrder of Duties upon Landing: A\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See\nit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from\nunder its belly?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes sir. An excellent view, Captain Linden.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you think of it, Split? Ever see a sight like that before?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what about it? Any comments?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split answered me with an enthusiastic, \"By gollies, sir!\" Then, with\nrestraint, \"It's precisely what I expected from the photographs, sir.\nAny orders, sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Relax, Split! That's the order. Relax!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks\u2014thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though\ncoming from him it was strained. His training had given him an\nexaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all,\nhis scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his\nwords even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he\nrequired in his coffee.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Needless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits.\nAcross the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled\n(our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I\nhad sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim\nhis fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually\nphysically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the\npart. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"\u2014and the wide ears that\nstuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of\nselfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I\ncould rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you see?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I cannot say definitely. The exact scientific classification of the\nobject I am observing would call for more detailed scrutiny\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're seeing some sort of object?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What sort of object?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A living creature, sir\u2014upright, wearing clothes\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A\n  <b>\n   man\n  </b>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To all appearances, sir\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You bounder, give me that telescope!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  2.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have explored the weird life of many a planet, as I have, you\ncan appreciate the deep sense of excitement that comes over me when,\nlooking out at a new world for the first time, I see a man-like animal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walking upright!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wearing adornments in the nature of clothing!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gazed, and my lungs filled with the breath of wonderment. A man!\nAcross millions of miles of space\u2014a man, like the men of the Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Six times before in my life of exploration I had gazed at new realms\nwithin the approachable parts of our universe, but never before had the\nliving creatures borne such wonderful resemblance to the human life of\nour Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He might have been creeping on all fours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He might have been skulking like a lesser animal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He might have been entirely naked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was none of these\u2014and at the very first moment of viewing him I\nfelt a kinship toward him. Oh, he was primitive in appearance\u2014but had\nmy ancestors not been the same? Was this not a mirror of my own race\na million years or so ago? I sensed that my own stream of life had\nsomehow crossed with his in ages gone by. How? Who can ever know? By\nwhat faded charts of the movements through the sky will man ever be\nable to retrace relationships of forms of life among planets?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get ready to go out and meet him, Campbell,\" I said. \"He's a friend.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split Campbell gave me a look as if to say, Sir, you don't even know\nwhat sort of animal he is, actually, much less whether he's friendly or\nmurderous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are some things I can sense on first sight, Campbell. Take my\nword for it, he's a friend.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't say anything, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good. Don't. Just get ready.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're going to go\n  <b>\n   out\n  </b>\n  \u2014?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" I said. \"Orders.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And meet both of them?\" Split was at the telescope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Both?\" I took the instrument from him. Both! \"Well!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They seem to be coming out of the ground,\" Split said. \"I see no signs\nof habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an underground\ncity\u2014though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One's a male and the other's a female,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Another hypothesis,\" said Split.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two \"friends\".\nThey were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen our\nship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparently\ncome up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied\nthem through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a\nhike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might\nguess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold,\ncleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of the\ncream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in\nthe breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this\nwas matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as a\ncircular mantle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was some\nsort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with the\nsetting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a break\nin the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions,\nhis moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back\nof her.... Three.... Four.... Five....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where do they come from?\" Split had paused in the act of checking\nequipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, I\nmight not have made a discovery. The landscape was\n  <b>\n   moving\n  </b>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a\nprominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I\nlooked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where the\ncrowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the trees\nthemselves were moving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Notice anything?\" I asked Split.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city.\" He\ngazed. \"They're coming from underground.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view of\nthe moving trees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Notice anything else unusual?\" I persisted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. The females\u2014I'm speaking hypothetically\u2014but they\n  <b>\n   must\n  </b>\n  be\nfemales\u2014are all wearing puffy white fur ornaments around their elbows.\nI wonder why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You haven't noticed the trees?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The females are quite attractive,\" said Split.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope.\nMobile trees were not new to me. I had seen similar vegetation on other\nplanets\u2014\"sponge-trees\"\u2014which possessed a sort of muscular quality. If\nthese were similar, they were no doubt feeding along the surface of the\nslope below the rocky plateau. The people in the clearing beyond paid\nno attention to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I studied the crowd of people. Only the leader wore the brilliant garb.\nThe others were more scantily clothed. All were handsome of build. The\nlemon-tinted sunlight glanced off the muscular shoulders of the males\nand the soft curves of the females.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those furry elbow ornaments on the females,\" I said to Split,\n\"they're for protection. The caves they live in must be narrow, so\nthey pad their elbows.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't they pad their shoulders? They don't have anything on their\nshoulders.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you complaining?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If we\nwere to walk out, or make any sounds, we might have interrupted their\nmeeting. Here they were in their native ritual of sunset, not knowing\nthat people from another world watched. The tall leader must be making\na speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms in\ncalm, graceful gestures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They'd better break it up!\" Split said suddenly. \"The jungles are\nmoving in on them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're spellbound,\" I said. \"They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't you\never see moving trees?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split said sharply, \"Those trees are marching! They're an army under\ncover. Look!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage for\na sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were as\ninnocent as a flock of sitting ducks. Split Campbell's voice was edged\nwith alarm. \"Captain! Those worshippers\u2014how can we warn them? Oh-oh!\nToo late. Look!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  All at once the advancing sponge-trees were tossed back over the heads\nof the savage band concealed within. They were warriors\u2014fifty or more\nof them\u2014with painted naked bodies. They dashed forward in a wide\nsemicircle, swinging crude weapons, bent on slaughter.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  3.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends.\nThey charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird\nclubs with a threat of death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain\u2014\n  <b>\n   Jim\n  </b>\n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n  <b>\n   could\n  </b>\n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the siren went off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n  <b>\n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n  </b>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n  <b>\n   warning\n  </b>\n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  4.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Vauna, the beautiful daughter of Tomboldo, came into my life during the\nweeks that I lay unconscious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I must have talked aloud much during those feverish hours of darkness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Campbell!\" I would call out of a nightmare. \"Campbell, we're about to\nland. Is everything set? Check the instruments again, Campbell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"S-s-sh!\" The low hush of Split Campbell's voice would somehow\npenetrate my dream.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The voices about me were soft.

H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain\nLinden? Or are you warning\n  <b>\n   yourself\n  </b>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred\nvision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her\u2014yes, she must have\nhaunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her\nfeatures more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the\nparty of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the\nattack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and\nfigure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's\nquestion. \"Myself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna.\nThe caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella\npeople lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of\ntheir life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning\nabout the world into which he has been born.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla talking together.\nOften when Campbell would stop in this part of the cavern to inquire\nabout me, Omosla would drop in also. She and Campbell were learning to\nconverse in simple words. And Vauna and I\u2014yes. If I could only avoid\nblacking out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wanted to see her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares. Space\nships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars.\nThe eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of\nVauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I regained my health gradually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you quite awake?\" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella\nwords. \"You speak better today. Your friend Campbell has brought you\nmore recordings of our language, so you can learn to speak more. My\nfather is eager to talk with you. But you must sleep more. You are\nstill weak.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust\nmyself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By\nnight they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep.\nStrange harmonies whispered through the caves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me\nthrough the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me,\nfaintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some\ncorridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to\ngo back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless\ndreams.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing\nbefore me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a\nhint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook\nthe fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his\nflowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and\nplayed, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have learned to talk,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You have had a long sleep.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am well again. See, I can almost walk.\" But as I started to rise,\nthe wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. \"I will\nwalk soon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars\nand told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the\nship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make\nmyself believe.\" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of\nforehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying\nto visualize the flight of a space ship. \"We will have much to tell\neach other.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope so,\" I said. \"Campbell and I came to learn about the\n  <b>\n   serpent\nriver\n  </b>\n  .\" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not\nknowing the Benzendella equivalent.\n  <b>\n   I\n  </b>\n  made an eel-like motion\nwith my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain,\nthe footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked\naround to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent\nfigure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and\ngreen diamond markings\u2014Gravgak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You get well?\" Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I get well,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The blow on the head,\" he said, \"was not meant.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant\nto be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes\ntold me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes\nflashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and\nstarted off. \"Get well!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway\nhe turned. \"Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She started. I reached and barely touched her hand. She stopped. \"I\nwill talk with you later, Gravgak.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now!\" he shouted. \"Alone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stalked off. A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her\nfather, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic\nmoment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master\u2014or her\nlover. He had called for her. She had followed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door.\n\"Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called\nthem! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified? Had I become merely a\njealous lover\u2014or was I right in my hunch that the tall muscular guard\nwas a potential traitor?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Vauna reappeared at once. I believe she was glad that she had been\ncalled back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gravgak came sullenly. At the edge of the crowd in the arched doorway\nhe stood scowling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"While we are together,\" old Tomboldo said quietly, looking around at\nthe assemblage, \"I must tell you the decision of the council. Soon we\nwill move back to the other part of the world.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were low murmurs of approval through the chamber.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will wait a few days,\" Tomboldo went on, \"until our new friend\u2014\"\nhe pointed to me\u2014\"is well enough to travel.

Captain Linden decides it's time for introductions, as if he senses he can trust this being, but they watch as a female and then many other people join the first man on the surface, seemingly coming out of an underground city. Linden and Campbell think their ship is out of sight, and watch a ritual that the man is performing to the setting sun. The crowd of people continues to increase, and Linden notices that the landscape is moving: trees are shifting in the ground. He and Campbell stay in the ship and observe the various types of clothing and the ritual itself, as well as the moving trees which seemed to be moving to attack the people. They are indeed warriors starting an attack, and started swinging weapons. Linden tells Campbell to start the siren on their ship to scare away the attackers, and the first man they'd seen, presumably the leader, starts towards the ship. Once they are close enough, it is obvious that the humanoids don't have eyebrows or eye lashes. Captain Linden hands the leader a medallion that plays a song, as a token of friendship. Tomboldo, the leader, starts a round of introductions through a lot of gesturing. Linden hopes to learn about the Serpent River through the people to understand its cultural significance, and these people start to ask about the siren noises. The warriors attack again and panic ensues, pushing the humans to use weapons this time. Gravgak, the guard who had been escorting the humans, is knocked down. As Linden tries to tend to him, Gravgak knocks him out with his club. Linden is unconscious for a few weeks, and Vauna, Tomboldo's daughter, spends a lot of time by the Captian's side. Linden reminds Campbell that they weren't allowed to marry anyone from this planet, but mostly in an effort to warn himself to be careful around Vauna. He learns that these people are called the Benzendellas. Tomboldo is baffled by the technology that the humans have, but Linden is not able to communicate his questions about the Serpent River. He sees Gravgak, who apologizes for the accidental injury, but from Vauna's reaction Linden is not sure if he is telling the truth.

As they watch, the leader of the humans seems to perform a kind of ritual, but then, Linden notices some trees moving uphill and watches in horror as warriors toss the trees aside and launch an attack on the humans using clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends. To avert a massacre, Linden orders Campbell to hit the siren, which startles the attackers so that they retreat. Linden and Campbell then approach the people and give the leader, Tomboldo, a musical medallion on a chain. Introductions are exchanged, and some of the humans make the siren sound, indicating they want to hear it again, but the attackers return. Linden throws a capsule bomb at them, making them fall back briefly, but they quickly resume their attack. Finally, Linden and Campbell throw fire at the attackers, wounding many of them, and they retreat. One of the Benzendella men who acts as a guard, Gravgak, is injured, and Linden and Campbell treat and wrap his wounds; when they finish, they use smelling salts to rouse him, and he jumps up swinging one of the clubs he has picked up.

The Keynes-Roy cameras had captured images of humanoid natives as well as a massive, silvery \"rope\" that appeared to move along the planet's surfaces, so Linden and Campbell hope to identify the \"rope.\" They station at a safe distance from it, since they are unsure of its purpose, and, during their observations, they witness a group of native Benzendella emerge from their underground city for some kind of sunset ritual. As the group gathers around their leader--a muscular individual clothed in a cream-colored robe and red headdress--Jim and Split notice a group of trees drifting slowly over the sand towards the Benzendellas.

When they throw off their disguises and begin to charge, Split triggers one of the ship's sirens, and the attackers retreat back to the trees. Jim and Split walk to meet the group's leader, Tomboldo, and they offer a gift as a gesture of good will. Tomboldo has a guard, Gravgak, protect them as they make their way back to the city, and Gravgak tells them to mimic the ship's siren in order to keep the attackers at bay. However, the antagonists attack again, and Jim deploys one of his capsule bombs. Gravgak retrieves one of the attacker's clubs and runs towards them.

They are joined by more and more people, around 40 eventually. Split and Linden watch in awe as the leader, a man in robes and a headdress, performs some sort of ritual. Linden notices that the trees are moving towards them, nothing too unusual. He\u2019d seen sponge-trees before on other planets. However, these trees were being used as a cover for an attack. A horde of naked warriors rushes out with clubs and circles the ceremony. Linden orders Split to hit #16, and a siren wails out from their spaceship.

As he slowly healed and felt more normal, he had to warn himself to be careful around Vauna, the Benzendella leader's daughter, who had been watching him at his bedside. She was very beautiful, and he knew it was against mission code to marry locals.

He and Split Campbell cautiously land a good distance from the rope-like object in case it is dangerous. Although he is in command, Linden has a good sense of humor and likes to joke with and poke fun at Split; in fact, Linden is the one who gave him his nickname. Linden allows some gray area in following the Code, for example, encouraging Campbell to look through the telescope at the rope before Campbell has finished writing his reports. After exclaiming rather unprofessionally at what he sees, Linden \u201corders\u201d him to take it easy. The two men are on their first voyage together, and Linden has entertained himself on the journey of millions of miles by teasing Campbell. Linden has been to six other planets, but none of them had beings that were so similar to humans; the ones on the current planet look like the human ancestors from one million years ago, and Linden is very excited about this. Linden senses that the humanoids are friendly and trusts his intuition; this is why he decides to help them when the other group attacks them. He tries to befriend the leader by offering him a singing medallion on a chain, but what really impresses them is the way he and Campbell help them when the attackers return. After the battle, Linden is hit in the head by a rock attached to the club that Gravgak used when Gravgak jumps up after being roused to consciousness. Linden suffers a head injury and is unconscious for several days. While he is recuperating, the humanoid leader\u2019s daughter Vauna cares for him, and he falls in love with her. Linden reminds Campbell of Clause D of the EGGWE Code, which states that none of their agents can marry a native but then admits he is reminding himself of this, not Campbell. When Gravgak states he is ready to talk to Vauna alone, Linden reaches for her hand, letting her know his feelings about her.

It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n  <i>\n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n  </i>\n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n  <i>\n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n  </i>\n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n  <i>\n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n  </i>\n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n </p>\n <p>\n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n  </i>\n  But it was impossible!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n  <i>\n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n  </i>\n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Now I've done it!\n  </i>\n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were no wires!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   But this is impossible!\n  </i>\n  he thought.\n  <i>\n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n </p>\n <p>\n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n </p>\n <p>\n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n  <i>\n   You're\n  </i>\n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how could a man alive\n  <i>\n   today\n  </i>\n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n  <i>\n   ancient\n  </i>\n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n  <i>\n   derived\n  </i>\n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n  <i>\n   learning\n  </i>\n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "f82e99464a664cfaa6f100e4294d6072", "response_text": "\nIn 1953, an advertisement for the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth appears in magazines.

The three of them received an identical form in return, and each filled out the long questionnaire with a large amount of personal information. Donald's wife tried to convince him to fill the form out with false answers, but he was honest as the others were. A week after these questionnaires were sent, POSAT sent different envelopes to these three people. Bill Evans, for instance, received a standard pamphlet with metaphysical discussion. He was disappointed by this but was pleased to be starting a new job near the POSAT offices soon, which he did not realized was connected. Miss Arnable received several pamphlets and an offer to pay dues, which she did immediately. Donald Alford received a series of multiple choice questions about moral decisions surrounding potentially dangerous events. His answers got him an interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, but it would be in the middle of a work day, almost a hundred miles away. Although he was surprised to have received the letter at his lab, because he had only given POSAT his home address, his curiosity drove him to take the interview. It took him some time to find the POSAT headquarters, hidden in the back of an alley, and he was struck by the elegance of the first room he was invited into. He was slightly taller than the people the room was built for, hitting his head on a light and having to bend over to look at paintings. He found an impossible-seeming lightbulb, that resembled a secret project he was working on but in later stages. He was locked in the room, but eventually escorted to see the Grand Chairman, passing over an incredible laboratory with an atomic reactor. It turns out the Grand Chairman was Dr. Crandon, Donald's mentor, which made Donald confused, as he had trusted Dr. Crandon but could not trust what was happening in the laboratory he had seen. Dr. Crandon explained that although most of their work was illegal, he considered it some of the most moral work being done. Dr. Crandon walked Donald through the history of the organization, waxing poetic about the founder's genius as a physical scientist and mathematician. He did not have the technology to act on his theories, but left enough information for people in the future to develop technologies, following what Crandon called the path to truth.

Miss Elizabeth Arnable, a cat enthusiast who doesn\u2019t read, connects with the advertisement's religious and mystical undertones since she believes her cats to be reincarnated family members. Donald Alford, a research physicist, is the most skeptical among them, and his interest in POSAT is purely scientific; he wants to determine POSAT\u2019s true purpose, and so he completes the autobiographical form all three of them receive in response to their individual inquiries for more information. The impractical, metaphysical pamphlet Bill receives in response to his form disappoints him; however, he also receives a job offer at a pharmacy attached to the very warehouse that also houses POSAT's headquarters. Miss Arnable receives a membership pin, several pamphlets full of hidden truths of ancient wisdom, and information regarding membership fees. Don Alford receives a questionnaire that appears to be some kind of personality test catered to him specifically, despite the fact he has thus far revealed nothing of his life to them. Don's wife, Betty, wonders if POSAT might be some kind of spy society. In response to his questionnaire, POSAT invites Don to their headquarters to meet with their Grand Chairman in order to conduct an interview prior to his membership acceptance. Don struggles to decide whether or not to attend the meeting, considering the headquarters is nearly one-hundred miles from his home, and the lab where he works typically frowns upon using work time for personal matters. However, he decides to go anyway, and he finds the headquarters is part of a massive warehouse that is also home to a printer's plant, upholstering shop, and a pharmacy where Bill Evans now works. A receptionist guides him to a waiting room, where he discovers a number of brightly-lit Renaissance-style paintings. When he accidentally dislodges a light tube, he realizes the technology keeping it lit resembles his own research back at the lab--research that has not yet been released for public consumption. When he meets the Grand Chairman, he begins to make sense of the true purpose of POSAT; the Grand Chairman is actually Dr. Crandon, a physicist whose research Don has admired for several decades. Dr. Crandon explains POSAT is a society started four hundred years ago by a genius mathematician and physical scientist whose knowledge and discoveries were so advanced and powerful, he felt they must be kept secret until the world was ready to handle them in a responsible fashion.

The first room in the POSAT headquarters is a dingy waiting room, which acts as a facade or screening room of sorts so that they do not show their hand to people they are not sure will want to enter the organization. The real waiting room is a gorgeous, ornate room with Renaissance paintings on the walls, part of the personal collection of POSAT's founder. There was a beautiful rug on the floor, some filing cabinets, and some curious fluorescent lights that seemed more advanced that Donald figured possible. Past this room, the Grand Chairman has an office that is also ornate, with a frosted glass door, but between this office and the waiting room there is a balcony. This balcony acts like a bridge between the two rooms over a laboratory. This laboratory is visible from this walkway and is full of extremely advanced technology that Donald is not able to identify by sight, as it is beyond its time.

It was founded by a genius of a man who lived during the Italian Renaissance, roughly 400 years ago. The founder was a mathematician and scientist, and he invented calculus, created the quantum theory of light, and wrote Maxwell\u2019s equations. However, he did not get credit for any of these ideas. He also designed the atomic reactor that Don sees in the laboratory of the building. The founder understood how dangerous the atomic bomb was, and he did not want to give his peers the tools to create such a powerful weapon. He did not trust men who were at war with one another over political power. Still, he did not want his knowledge to vanish when he died, so he created POSAT. He was willing to share his scientific and mathematical secrets, but he did not wish for untrustworthy people to get their hands on the information until it would be safe to do so. The founder also wanted POSAT to work towards a more peaceful society where everyone could be trusted to share knowledge and information without the fear of it leading to catastrophic events. \n\nIn the centuries since the society was founded, the members have invented new tools and technologies that are not available anywhere else in the world, like the atomic reactor shield and the lightbulbs that hang above each Renaissance painting in the waiting room. Yet, the secret society\u2019s main goal is to create a civilized society, not new inventions. In an effort to make that vision a reality, members of POSAT created a very large computer that seeks to decode human motivation. The computer used Don\u2019s multiple choice questionnaire to determine that Don would be a good fit for the society because he is trustworthy. Although it seems like POSAT should involve more renowned scientists and peacekeepers to make sure it accomplishes its mission, it must also guard all of its secrets, and in an increasingly surveilled state, that would be nearly impossible to do while also including great thought leaders. \n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "4cbf046092bb457fb6ca456c5b47a30f", "response_text": "POSAT, or The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth, is a secret society that considers itself \"ancient and honorable\", which has been active since the Renaissance Era.

I was a conformist then; I was still one that morning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I awoke. The glowlight was on, slowly increasing. I was in my living\nmachine in Center Four, where I belonged, and all the familiar things\nwere about me, reality was back, but I was breathing very hard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I lay on the pneumo a while before getting up. I looked at the\nchroner: 0703 hours, Day 17, Month IX, New Century Three. My morning\nnuro-tablets had already popped from the tube, and the timer had begun\nto boil an egg. The egg was there because the realfood allotment had\nbeen increased last month. The balance of trade with Southem had just\nswung a decimal or two our way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I rose finally, stepped to the mirror, switched it to positive and\nlooked at myself. New wrinkles\u2014or maybe just a deepening of the old\nones. It was beginning to show; the past two years were leaving traces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hadn't worried about my appearance when I'd been with the Office of\nWeapons. There, I'd been able to keep pretty much to myself, doing\nresearch on magnetic mechanics as applied to space drive. But other\njobs, where you had to be among people, might be different. I needed\nevery possible thing in my favor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, I still hoped for a job, even after two years. I still meant to\nkeep on plugging, making the rounds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd go out again today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The timer clicked and my egg was ready. I swallowed the tablets and\nthen took the egg to the table to savor it and make it last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I leaned forward to sit, the metal tag dangled from my neck,\ncatching the glowlight. My identity tag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everything came back in a rush\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  My name. The dream and\n  <i>\n   her\n  </i>\n  voice. And her suggestion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Would I dare? Would I start out this very morning and take the risk,\nthe terrible risk?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  You remember renumbering. Two years ago. You remember how it was then;\nhow everybody looked forward to his new designation, and how everybody\nmade jokes about the way the letters came out, and how all the records\nwere for a while fouled up beyond recognition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The telecomics kidded renumbering. One went a little too far and\nthey psycho-scanned him and then sent him to Marscol as a dangerous\nnonconform.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you were disappointed with your new designation, you didn't\ncomplain. You didn't want a sudden visit from the Deacons during the\nnight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There had to be renumbering. We all understood that. With the\npopulation of Northem already past two billion, the old designations\nwere too clumsy. Renumbering was efficient. It contributed to the good\nof Northem. It helped advance the warless struggle with Southem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The equator is the boundary. I understand that once there was\na political difference and that the two superstates sprawled\nlongitudinally, not latitudinally, over the globe. Now they are pretty\nmuch the same. There is the truce, and they are both geared for war.\nThey are both efficient states, as tightly controlled as an experiment\nwith enzymes, as microsurgery, as the temper of a diplomat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We were renumbered, then, in Northem. You know the system: everybody\nnow has six digits and an additional prefix or suffix of four letters.\nStateleader, for instance, has the designation AAAA-111/111. Now, to\naddress somebody by calling off four letters is a little clumsy. We try\nto pronounce them when they are pronounceable. That is, no one says to\nStateleader, \"Good morning, A-A-A-A.\" They say, \"Good morning, Aaaa.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reading the last quote, I notice a curious effect. It says what I feel.\nOf course I didn't feel that way on that particular morning. I was\nstill conformal; the last thing in my mind was that I would infract and\nbe psycho-scanned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Four letters then, and in many cases a pronounceable four letter word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A four letter word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, you suspect already. You know what a four letter word can be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mine was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was unspeakable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The slight weight on my forehead reminded me that I still wore my\nsleep-learner. I'd been studying administrative cybernetics, hoping to\nqualify in that field, although it was a poor substitute for a space\ndrive expert. I removed the band and stepped across the room and\nturned off the oscillator. I went back to my egg and my bitter memories.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I will never forget the first day I received my new four letter\ncombination and reported it to my chief, as required. I was unthinkably\nembarrassed. He didn't say anything. He just swallowed and choked\nand became crimson when he saw it. He didn't dare pass it to his\nsecretarial engineer; he went to the administrative circuits and\nregistered it himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can't blame him for easing me out. He was trying to run an efficient\norganization, after all, and no doubt I upset its efficiency. My work\nwas important\u2014magnetic mechanics was the only way to handle quanta\nreaction, or the so-called non-energy drive, and was therefore the\nanswer to feasible space travel beyond our present limit of Mars\u2014and\nthere were frequent inspection tours by Big Wheels and Very Important\nPersons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whenever anyone, especially a woman, asked my name, the embarrassment\nwould become a crackling electric field all about us. The best tactic\nwas just not to answer.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The chief called me in one day. He looked haggard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Er\u2014old man,\" he said, not quite able to bring himself to utter my\nname, \"I'm going to have to switch you to another department. How would\nyou like to work on nutrition kits? Very interesting work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nutrition kits?\n  <i>\n   Me?\n  </i>\n  On nutrition kits?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I\u2014er\u2014know it sounds unusual, but it justifies. I just had\nthe cybs work it over in the light of present regulations, and it\njustifies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everything had to justify, of course. Every act in the monthly report\nhad to be covered by regulations and cross-regulations. Of course there\nwere so many regulations that if you just took the time to work it out,\nyou could justify damn near anything. I knew what the chief was up to.\nJust to remove me from my post would have taken a year of applications\nand hearings and innumerable visits to the capital in Center One. But\nif I should infract\u2014deliberately infract\u2014it would enable the chief to\nlet me go. The equivalent of resigning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll infract,\" I said. \"Rather than go on nutrition kits, I'll\ninfract.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked vastly relieved. \"Uh\u2014fine,\" he said. \"I rather hoped you\nwould.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took a week or so. Then I was on Non-Productive status and issued an\nN/P book for my necessities. Very few luxury coupons in the N/P book.\nI didn't really mind at first. My new living machine was smaller, but\nbasically comfortable, and since I was still a loyal member of the\nstate and a verified conformist, I wouldn't starve.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I didn't know what I was in for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went from bureau to bureau, office to office, department to\ndepartment\u2014any place where they might use a space drive expert. A\npattern began to emerge; the same story everywhere. When I mentioned my\nspecialty they would look delighted. When I handed them my tag and they\nsaw my name, they would go into immediate polite confusion. As soon as\nthey recovered they would say they'd call me if anything turned up....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A few weeks of this and I became a bit dazed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then there was the problem of everyday existence.

You can see his stare curdle. He scowls at the book again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not sure this is in order. Better go to the end of the line. We'll\ncheck it later.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You know what happens before the end of the line reaches the counter.\nNo more packages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, I couldn't get myself off N/P status until I got a post, and\nwith my name I\n  <i>\n   couldn't\n  </i>\n  get a post.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nor could I change my name. You know what happens when you try to\nchange something already on the records. The very idea of wanting\nchange implies criticism of the State. Unthinkable behavior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was why this curious dream voice shocked me so. The thing that it\nsuggested was quite as embarrassing as its non-standard, emotional,\nprovocative tone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bear with me; I'm getting to the voice\u2014to\n  <i>\n   her\n  </i>\n  \u2014in a moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to tell you first about the loneliness, the terrible loneliness.\nI could hardly join group games at any of the rec centers. I could join\nno special interest clubs or even State Loyalty chapters. Although I\ndabbled with theoretical research in my own quarters, I could scarcely\nsubmit any findings for publication\u2014not with my name attached. A\npseudonym would have been non-regulation and illegal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there was the worst thing of all. I could not mate.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Funny, I hadn't thought about mating until it became impossible. I\nremember the first time, out of sheer idleness, I wandered into a\nEugenic Center. I filled out my form very carefully and submitted it\nfor analysis and assignment. The clerk saw my name, and did the usual\ndouble-take. He coughed and swallowed and fidgeted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"Of course you understand that we must submit your\napplication to the woman authorized to spend time in the mating booths\nwith you, and that she has the right to refuse.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, I understand that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"M'm,\" he said, and dismissed me with a nod.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I waited for a call in the next few weeks, still hoping, but I knew\nno woman would consent to meet a man with my name, let alone enter a\nmating booth with him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The urge to reproduce myself became unbearable. I concocted all sorts\nof wild schemes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I might infract socially and be classified a nonconform and sent to\nMarscol. I'd heard rumors that in that desolate land, on that desolate\nplanet, both mingling and mating were rather disgustingly unrestricted.\nCasual mating would be terribly dangerous, of course, with all the wild\nirradiated genes from the atomic decade still around, but I felt I'd be\nwilling to risk that. Well, almost....\n </p>\n <p>\n  About then I began to have these dreams. As I've told you, in the dream\nthere was only this woman's seductive voice. The first time I heard it\nI awoke in a warm sweat and swore something had gone wrong with the\nsleep-learner. You never hear the actual words with this machine, of\ncourse; you simply absorb the concepts unconsciously. Still, it seemed\nan explanation. I checked thoroughly. Nothing wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next night I heard the woman's voice again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Try it\n  </i>\n  ,\" she said. \"\n  <i>\n   Do it. Start tomorrow to get your name changed.\nThere will be a way. There must be a way. The rules are so mixed up\nthat a clever man can do almost anything. Do it, please\u2014for me.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She was not only trying to get me to commit nonconformity, but making\nheretical remarks besides. I awoke that time and half-expected a Deacon\nto pop out of the tube and turn his electric club upon me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And I heard the voice nearly every night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It hammered away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   What if you do fail? Almost anything would be better than the\nmiserable existence you're leading now!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  One morning I even caught myself wondering just how I'd go about this\nidea of hers. Wondering what the first step might be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She seemed to read my thoughts. That night she said, \"\n  <i>\n   Consult the cybs\nin the Govpub office. If you look hard enough and long enough, you'll\nfind a way.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, on this morning of the seventeenth day in the ninth month,\nI ate my boiled egg slowly and actually toyed with the idea. I\nthought of being on productive status again. I had almost lost my\nfanatical craving to be useful to the State, but I did want to be\nbusy\u2014desperately. I didn't want to be despised any more. I didn't\nwant to be lonely. I wanted to reproduce myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I made my decision suddenly. Waves of emotion carried me along. I got\nup, crossed the room to the directory, and pushbuttoned to find the\nlocation of the nearest Govpub office.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't know what would happen and almost didn't care.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like most important places, the Govpub Office in Center Four was\nunderground. I could have taken a tunnelcar more quickly, but it seemed\npleasanter to travel topside. Or maybe I just wanted to put this off a\nbit. Think about it. Compose myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the entrance to the Govpub warren there was a big director cyb, a\nplate with a speaker and switch. The sign on it said to switch it on\nand get close to the speaker and I did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cyb's mechanical voice\u2014they never seem to get the \"th\" sounds\nright\u2014said, \"This is Branch Four of the Office of Government\nPublications. Say, 'Publications,' and/or, 'Information desired,' as\nthoroughly and concisely as possible. Use approved voice and standard\nphraseology.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, simple enough so far. I had always rather prided myself on my\nknack for approved voice, those flat, emotionless tones that indicate\nefficiency. And I would never forget how to speak Statese. I said,\n\"Applicant desires all pertinent information relative assignment,\nchange or amendment of State Serial designations, otherwise generally\nreferred to as nomenclature.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a second's delay while the audio patterns tripped relays and\nbrought the memory tubes in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the cyb said, \"Proceed to Numbering and Identity section. Consult\nalphabetical list and diagram on your left for location of same.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks,\" I said absent-mindedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started to turn away and the cyb said, \"Information on tanks is\nmilitary information and classified. State authorization for\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I switched it off.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Numbering and Identity wasn't hard to find. I took the shaft to the\nproper level and then it was only a walk of a few hundred yards through\nthe glowlit corridors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  N. &amp; I. turned out to be a big room, somewhat circular, very\nhigh-ceilinged, with banks of cyb controls covering the upper walls.\nNarrow passageways, like spokes, led off in several directions. There\nwas an information desk in the center of the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked that way and my heart went into free fall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a girl at the information desk. An exceptionally attractive\ngirl. She was well within the limits of acceptable standard, and her\nfeatures were even enough, and her hair a middle blonde\u2014but she had\nsomething else. Hard to describe. It was a warmth, a buoyancy, a sense\nof life and intense animation. It didn't exactly show; it radiated. It\nseemed to sing out from her clear complexion, from her figure, which\neven a tunic could not hide, from everything about her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if I were to state my business, I would have to tell her my name.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I almost backed out right then. I stopped momentarily. And then common\nsense took hold and I realized that if I were to go through with this\nthing, here would be only the first of a long series of embarrassments\nand discomforts. It had to be done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I walked up to the desk and the girl turned to face me, and I could\nhave sworn that a faint smile crossed her lips. It was swift, like the\nshadow of a bird across one of the lawns in one of the great parks\ntopside. Very non-standard. Yet I wasn't offended; if anything, I felt\nsuddenly and disturbingly pleased.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What information is desired?\" she asked. Her voice was standard\u2014or\nwas it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again I had the feeling of restrained warmth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I used colloquial. \"I want to get the dope on State Serial\ndesignations, how they're assigned and so forth. Especially how they\nmight be changed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She put a handsteno on the desk top and said, \"Name? Address? Post?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I froze. I stood there and stared at her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked up and said, \"Well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\u2014er\u2014no post at present. N/P status.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her fingers moved on the steno.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gave her my address and she recorded that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I paused again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"And your name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took a deep breath and told her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't want to look into her eyes. I wanted to look away, but I\ncouldn't find a decent excuse to. I saw her eyes become wide and\nnoticed for the first time that they were a warm gray, almost a mouse\ncolor. I felt like laughing at that irrelevant observation, but more\nthan that I felt like turning and running. I felt like climbing and\ndashing all over the walls like a frustrated cat and yelling at the\ntop of my lungs. I felt like anything but standing there and looking\nstupid, meeting her stare\u2014\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She looked down quickly and recorded my name. It took her a little\nlonger than necessary. In that time she recovered. Somewhat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" she said finally, \"I'll make a search.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She turned to a row of buttons on a console in the center of the desk\nand began to press them in various combinations. A typer clicked away.\nShe tore off a slip of paper, consulted it, and said, \"Information\ndesired is in Bank 29. Please follow me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, following her was a pleasure, anyway. I could watch the movement\nof her hips and torso as she walked. She was not tall, but long-legged\nand extremely lithe. Graceful and rhythmic. Very, very feminine, almost\nbeyond standard in that respect. I felt blood throb in my temples and\nwas heartily ashamed of myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would like to be in a mating booth with her, I thought, the full\nauthorized twenty minutes. And I knew I was unconformist and the\nrealization hardly scared me at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She led me down one of the long passageways.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few moments later I said, \"Don't you sometimes get\u2014well, pretty\nlonely working here?\" Personal talk at a time like this wasn't approved\nbehavior, but I couldn't help it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She answered hesitantly, but at least she answered. She said, \"Not\nterribly. The cybs are company enough most of the time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't get many visitors, then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not right here. N. &amp; I. isn't a very popular section. Most people who\ncome to Govpub spend their time researching in the ancient manuscript\nroom. The\u2014er\u2014social habits of the pre-atomic civilization.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I laughed. I knew what she meant, all right. Pre-atomics and their\nideas about free mating always fascinated people. I moved up beside\nher. \"What's your name, by the way?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"L-A-R-A 339/827.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pronounced it. \"Lara. Lah-rah. That's beautiful. Fits you, too.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She didn't answer; she kept her eyes straight ahead and I saw the faint\nspot of color on her cheek.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had a sudden impulse to ask her to meet me after hours at one\nof the rec centers. If it had been my danger alone, I might have,\nbut I couldn't very well ask her to risk discovery of a haphazard,\nunauthorized arrangement like that and the possibility of going to the\npsycho-scan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We came to a turn in the corridor and something happened; I'm not sure\njust how it happened. I keep telling myself that my movements were not\nactually deliberate. I was to the right of her. The turn was to the\nleft. She turned quickly, and I didn't, so that I bumped into her,\nknocking her off balance. I grabbed her to keep her from falling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment we stood there, face to face, touching each other lightly.\nI held her by the arms. I felt the primitive warmth of her breath. Our\neyes held together ... proton ... electron ... I felt her tremble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She broke from my grip suddenly and started off again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that she was very business-like.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We came finally to the controls of Bank 29 and she stood before them\nand began to press button combinations. I watched her work; I watched\nher move. I had almost forgotten why I'd come here. The lights blinked\non and off and the typers clacked softly as the machine sorted out\ninformation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She had a long printed sheet from the roll presently. She frowned at\nit and turned to me. \"You can take this along and study it,\" she said,\n\"but I'm afraid what you have in mind may be\u2014a little difficult.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She must have guessed what I had in mind. I said, \"I didn't think it\nwould be easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It seems that the only agency authorized to change a State Serial\nunder any circumstances is Opsych.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Opsych?\" You can't keep up with all these departments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Office of Psychological Adjustment. They can change you if you go\nfrom a lower to higher E.A.C.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't get it, exactly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As she spoke I had the idea that there was sympathy in her voice. Just\nan overtone. \"Well,\" she said, \"as you know, the post a person is\nqualified to hold often depends largely on his Emotional Adjustment\nCategory. Now if he improves and passes from, let us say, Grade 3 to\nGrade 4, he will probably change his place of work. In order to protect\nhim from any associative maladjustments developed under the old E.A.C,\nhe is permitted a new number.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I groaned. \"But I'm already in the highest E.A.C.!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It looks very uncertain then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sometimes I think I'd be better off in the mines, or on\nMarscol\u2014or\u2014in the hell of the pre-atomics!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked amused. \"What did you say your E.A.C. was?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, all right. Sorry.\" I controlled myself and grinned. \"I guess this\nwhole thing has been just a little too much for me. Maybe my E.A.C.'s\neven gone down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That might be your chance then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you could get to the top man in Opsych and demonstrate that your\nnumber has inadvertently changed your E.A.C., he might be able to\njustify a change.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By the State, he might!\" I punched my palm. \"Only how do I get to him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can find his location on the cyb here. Center One, the capital, for\na guess. You'll have to get a travel permit to go there, of course.\nJust a moment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She worked at the machine again, trying it on general data. The printed\nslip came out a moment later and she read it to me. Chief, Opsych, was\nin the capital all right. It didn't give the exact location of his\noffice, but it did tell how to find the underground bay in Center One\ncontaining the Opsych offices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We headed back through the passageway then and she kept well ahead of\nme. I couldn't keep my eyes from her walk, from the way she walked with\neverything below her shoulders. My blood was pounding at my temples\nagain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to keep the conversation going. \"Do you think it'll be hard to\nget a travel permit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not impossible. My guess is that you'll be at Travbur all day\ntomorrow, maybe even the next day. But you ought to be able to swing it\nif you hold out long enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sighed. \"I know. It's that way everywhere in Northem. Our motto ought\nto be, 'Why make it difficult when with just a little more effort you\ncan make it impossible?'\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She started to laugh, and then, as she emerged from the passageway into\nthe big circular room, she cut her laugh short.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A second later, as I came along, I saw why.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were two Deacons by the central desk. They were burly and had\nthat hard, pinched-face look and wore the usual black belts. Electric\nclubs hung from the belts. Spidery looking pistols were at their sides.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't know whether these two had heard my crack or not. I know they\nkept looking at me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lara and I crossed the room silently, she back to her desk, I to the\nexit door. The Deacons' remote, disapproving eyes swung in azimuth,\ntracking us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I walked out and wanted to turn and smile at Lara, and get into my\nsmile something of the hope that someday, somewhere, I'd see her\nagain\u2014but of course I didn't dare.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had the usual difficulties at Travbur the next day. I won't go into\nthem, except to say that I was batted from office to office like a ping\npong ball, and that, when I finally got my travel permit, I was made to\nfeel that I had stolen an original Picasso from the State Museum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I made it in a day. Just. I got my permit thirty seconds before closing\ntime. I was to take the jetcopter to Center One at 0700 hours the\nfollowing morning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my living machine that evening, I was much too excited to work at\ntheoretical research as I usually did after a hard day of tramping\naround. I bathed, I paced a while, I sat and hummed nervously and\ngot up and paced again. I turned on the telepuppets. There was a\ndrama about the space pilots who fly the nonconformist prisoners to\nthe forests and pulp-acetate plants on Mars. Seemed that the Southem\npolitical prisoners who are confined to the southern hemisphere of\nMars, wanted to attack and conquer the north. The nonconformists, led\nby our pilot, came through for the State in the end. Corn is thicker\nthan water. Standard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were, however, some good stereofilm shots of the limitless\nforests of Mars, and I wondered what it would be like to live there, in\na green, fresh-smelling land. Pleasant, I supposed, if you could put up\nwith the no doubt revolting morality of a prison planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the drama seemed to point out that there was no more security for\nthe nonconformists out there than for us here on Earth. Maybe somewhere\nin the universe, I thought, there would be peace for men. Somewhere\nbeyond the solar system, perhaps, someday when we had the means to go\nthere....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet instinct told me that wasn't the answer, either. I thought of a\nverse by an ancient pre-atomic poet named Hoffenstein. (People had\nunwieldy, random combinations of letters for names in those days.) The\npoem went:\n </p>\n Wherever I go,\n <i>\n  I\n </i>\n go too,\n And spoil everything.\n <p>\n  That was it. The story of mankind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned the glowlight down and lay on the pneumo after a while, but I\ndidn't sleep for a long, long time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, when I did sleep, when I had been sleeping, I heard the voice\nagain. The low, seductive woman's voice\u2014the startling, shocking voice\nout of my unconscious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   You have taken the first step\n  </i>\n  ,\" she said. \"\n  <i>\n   You are on your way\nto freedom. Don't stop now. Don't sink back into the lifelessness of\nconformity. Go on ... on and on. Keep struggling, for that is the only\nanswer....\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I didn't exactly talk back, but in the queer way of the dream, I\n  <i>\n   thought\n  </i>\n  objections. I was in my thirties, at the mid-point of my\nlife, and the whole of that life had been spent under the State. I knew\nno other way to act. Suppressing what little individuality I might\nhave was, for me, a way of survival. I was chockful of prescribed,\nstereotyped reactions, and I held onto them even when something within\nme told me what they were. This wasn't easy, this breaking away, not\neven this slight departure from the secure, camouflaged norm....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   The woman, Lara, attracts you\n  </i>\n  ,\" said the voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suppose at that point I twitched or rolled in my sleep. Yes, the\nvoice was right, the woman Lara attracted me. So much that I ached with\nit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Take her. Find a way. When you succeed in changing your name, and\nknow that you can do things, then find a way. There will be a way.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The idea at once thrilled and frightened me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I woke writhing and in a sweat again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was morning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I dressed and headed for the jetcopter stage and the ship for Center\nOne.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship was comfortable and departed on time, a transport with seats\nfor about twenty passengers. I sat near the tail and moodily busied\nmyself watching the gaunt brown earth far below. Between Centers there\nwas mostly desert, only occasional patches of green. Before the atomic\ndecade, I had heard, nearly all the earth was green and teemed with\nlife ... birds, insects, animals, people, too. It was hard rock and\nsand now, with a few scrubs hanging on for life. The pre-atomics, who\nhadn't mastered synthesization, would have a hard time scratching\nexistence from the earth today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to break the sad mood, and started to look around at some of\nthe other passengers. That was when I first noticed the prisoners\nin the forward seats. Man and woman, they were, a youngish, rather\nnon-descript couple, thin, very quiet. They were manacled and two\nDeacons sat across from them. The Deacons' backs were turned to me and\nI could see the prisoners' faces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had curious faces. Their eyes were indescribably sad, and yet\ntheir lips seemed to be ready to smile at any moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were holding hands, not seeming to care about this vulgar\nemotional display.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had the sudden crazy idea that Lara and I were sitting there, holding\nhands like that, nonconforming in the highest, and that we were\nwonderfully happy. Our eyes were sad too, but we were really happy,\nquietly happy, and that was why our lips stayed upon the brink of a\nsmile.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "102", "uid": "11dd8ba238544c898543567786418130", "response_text": "The narrator is awoken by a female voice in his head.

He sees the toll of the past two years, since the renumbering. \nThe narrator explains that, as part of ensuring the efficiency of Northem, the designation of each citizen is periodically changed. In the most recent one, everyone was assigned six numerical digits and a prefix or suffix of four letters, which often spelled something pronounceable \u2013 for the narrator, the four letters spelled an unspeakably vulgar word. As a result, the narrator is forced to infract from his job and assume non-productive status and begins encountering difficulties in quotidien tasks, such as receiving his realfood package. Furthermore, his designation prevents him from acquiring gainful employment and reassuming productive status, as well as the ability to mate. \nThe narrator then recounts hearing the woman\u2019s voice for the first time. She encourages him to change his name, a difficult thing to do because of its implied criticism of the state. The voice returns in his sleep, nearly every night. Driven by his loneliness and social ostracization, the narrator brings himself to the Govpub Office, a sort of government center, in an attempt to change his designation. \nIn the underground office of his local Govpub Office, the narrator navigates his way to the Numbering and Identity section with help of a cyb, an automated assistant. In the round room that is the Number and Identity department, he observes a remarkably attractive woman at the information desk. Though he is nervous at first, fearing that he will have to share with her his embarrassing name, he dismisses his hesitance and approaches her. He reluctantly shares his name, and asks that she direct him to information concerning state serial designations. \nAs the girl, whose name she reveals is LARA, leads the narrator to information bank 29 where the requested information is stored, they share an inappropriate moment: Lara trips and the narrator grabs her arms. Lara\u2019s demeanor changes, and she now conducts herself in an all-business fashion. At bank 29, Lara explains to the narrator the tasks he must complete in order to change his name, including traveling to the capital. On their way back to the main room, the narrator makes a joke which elicits a laugh from Lara. As she enters the rotunda, she abruptly stops laughing. The narrator, following closely behind, quickly realizes why: two Deacons, officers of the state, are at the central desk. \nOn the night before his departure to the capital, the narrator once again hears the mysterious female voice in his head.

When the employer hears about his specialty, they look very delight. However, when he hands them his tag with his name on it, they always tell him that they will call if anything turns up. But just like what happened with the Eugenic Center, no one called. The main character further complains about being an N/P, it might sound great at first, but he cannot even get a package.\n\nFinally, with the voice in his dream telling him to \u201cdo it\u201d every night, he decided to go to the Govpub Office in Center Four to look for ways that he can change his name. At the N. & I. he gets attracted to the information desk girl, L-A-R-A 339/827. He asked her for information regarding how State Serial, thus the names, are assigned, and how they can be changed. After hearing his name, she is a bit shocked, but then she decides to help him out. Then later she points out that he needs to get a travel permit in order to get to Opsych, The Office of Psychological Adjustment. Apparently, Opsych is the only place that can authorize a change to the State Serial. She tells him to explain how his State Serial has affected his E.A.C, and then there may be a chance that they will change it. Even though he is still doubtful that night, the next day he goes to the jetcopter stage and board the ship for Center One.

He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's the very\n  <i>\n   best\n  </i>\n  Martian honey,\" said his wife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\n  <i>\n   Malcolm!\n  </i>\n  Where\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Malcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No trans\u2014nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\nup there and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Maud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\n  <i>\n   That?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Greg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Enid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Greg said, \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  J. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Greg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is there anything we can do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\n  <i>\n   quick\n  </i>\n  ! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Those next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  J. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somewhere in space. He looked through the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  . What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\n  <i>\n   Carefree\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\n  <i>\n   Carefree\n  </i>\n  ; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\n  <i>\n   Carefree\n  </i>\n  was accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Greg Malcolm turned from the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  , shaken.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  , how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Only a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\nbounce\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then they struck!\n </p>\n <p>\n  But they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high\n  <i>\n   ping!\n  </i>\n  of stress; somewhere aft\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\nthey were safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nnice work!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It would have been\n  <i>\n   better\n  </i>\n  work, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\nOur only\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\nMalcolm\u2014after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\nnormal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\nbroken skiff.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\n  <i>\n   anything\n  </i>\n  .\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Malcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  J. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\n  <i>\n   so\n  </i>\n  hungry)!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Greg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\n  <i>\n   dangerous\n  </i>\n  ! There are\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ralph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hannigan groaned and followed him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I said.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breadon flushed darkly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\n  <i>\n   Carefree\n  </i>\n  . Best equipment throughout.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\n  <i>\n   am\n  </i>\n  a radio operator, and there\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  a radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Greg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breadon frowned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breadon glared at him wrathfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place.

Both concealed on his person.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  the\nthug want?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Cassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him\nfeel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the\nalley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant\nshot by.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Echoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling\nthat no one was going to come to his assistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he\nmissed. He's turned around and is coming back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few\nseconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected\nstiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical\ninstrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its\nfunction, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but\nhe can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare.\nWhat he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep\nyou posted below the level of his hearing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against\nthe wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet.\nLow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of\na miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately,\nhis estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance,\nthe soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His\nopponent gasped and broke away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got\nhim. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's\nafraid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Attack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some\ndidn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent\nfell to the ground, gasped and was silent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near\nthe water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't\nmove.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely\nperceptible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Foam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed\nfrom cuts on the face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Horrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but\nwould the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to\ninvestigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would\nquestion him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what\ncould he do about it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney\n21?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of\nthis. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body\ndata\u2014a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles\nof no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount\nof money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A\npicture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which\nresembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed\nto be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of\ngetting to Tunney 21.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the\nboulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him.\nBefore he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly\ntrying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he\nwas forced to the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps\nrushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping\nby way of water.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in\nsight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man\nI've ever been strangled by.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the\nbasic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I\nchecked him, he had no heartbeat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted\nCassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't\n  <i>\n   wanted\n  </i>\n  to kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the\npolice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second\ntime he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was\nsuccessful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He\nsqueezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something, however, was missing\u2014his wallet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle.\nPersistent fellow. Damned persistent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the\nsupposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police.\nNow he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It\ncontained more money than his wallet had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Except for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it\nwas more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece\nof plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he\nnow had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for\nanother tab.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell.\nCuriously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word,\nSTAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling\nprecariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the\ndoor disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The\ntechnician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed\non the door.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  TRAVELERS AID BUREAU\n  <br/>\n  Murra Foray, First Counselor\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The\nold technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed\nhelp and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a\nmaze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable.\nTravelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he\nmanaged to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer\neverything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be\navailable for consultation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he\nasked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily.\n\"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to\nthe first counselor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the\nscreen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Travelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly\nsupplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him,\nCassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of\nhim. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and\nanswers. One thing he drew the line at\u2014why he wanted to go to Tunney\n21 was his own business.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed,\nthat anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average,\nrather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the\nchin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Close\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\n  <i>\n   if he could\n  </i>\n  . Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\n  <i>\n   Rickrock C\n  </i>\n  arrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't answer.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation,\nis near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've\ncovered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything\nwithin a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer\ndistances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly,\nCassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on\nor near Godolph. Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local\ntransportation, star-hopping?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't need that kind of luck.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the\nemphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help\nyou. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it\nplainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it\nwith me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier\nfor us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't\n  <i>\n   remember\n  </i>\n  your real name and where you put your identification\u2014\" She\narose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His\n  <i>\n   real\n  </i>\n  name!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently she returned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you\ndon't believe it, send back to\u2014\" He stopped. It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\n  <i>\n   Rickrock C\n  </i>\n  took off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken\noff a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently\nneeded elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't\nvanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend\non ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time,\ncredit established, lost identification replaced\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any\ntrouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I won't,\" he promised grimly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason?

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he\ninstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate\nlevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as\nquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Fellow Scientist:\n </p>\n <p>\n  A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are\navailable. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the\nThinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected\nthe professional men. Now both times are past. May they never return!\nI would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock sharp,\nThinkers' Foundation I.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Jorj Helmuth\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced\nthrough them, hesitated at the name \"Willard Farquar,\" looked at the\nsleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and\nplugged in the steno-robot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,\" a clear feminine voice\nannounced. \"He has the general staff with him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Martian peace to him,\" Jorj Helmuth said. \"Tell him I'll be down in a\nfew minutes.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed\nabove the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in\nthe Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,\nindicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair\non a boom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information\nand questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not\nresist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great\ncryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its\nown controls\u2014the permissible ones\u2014and could doubtless improvise a\nhearing apparatus if it wanted to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and\nManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.\nThis was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human\nbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the\nrims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney\nIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had\ngiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This\nwas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased\nhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   This was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy\nprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the\nmachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and\ngirl-fondness, \"Maizie.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord\nplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and\nshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,\nalthough his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with\nthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet\ninfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape\nthe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\n  <i>\n   guru\n  </i>\n  , his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly he began to tape again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Five hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off\nits fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it\neffortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped\nhimself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the\ndried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew\nhe had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more\nthan that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Used to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the\nfluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and\ngyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and\nparlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of\nfree fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would\ntoss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes\nshe swam for it frantically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer\nand began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on\nMars this trip\u2014priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to\nwar-battered mankind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up\non the air, and went to sleep.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Jorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed\neach to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away\nwith little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over\nhis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar\nAllen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool\nquestion like that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men\npuzzledly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at\nthe Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young\nFarquar.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd\ninvestigate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right\naway.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Sunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust\nmotes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes\nthere were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place\nof a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful,\nsensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather\nlike a bear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Opperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the\nMaelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still\nallow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt.\nAlmost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep\non teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've\nmaintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding\nto their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have\noverruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults\nisn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough\nabout this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of\nthis morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the\nThinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know\ntheir Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their\nMars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental\nscience is bunk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly\ninterposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be\ndone until it takes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Opperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think\nyou just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which\nyou probably aren't aware.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Opperly continued his inspection of the flowers' bells. \"All the more\nreason not to poke sticks through the bars at the lions and tigers\nstrolling outside. No, Willard, I'm not counseling appeasement. But\nconsider the age in which we live. It wants magicians.\" His voice grew\nespecially tranquil. \"A scientist tells people the truth. When times\nare good\u2014that is, when the truth offers no threat\u2014people don't mind.\nBut when times are very, very bad....\" A shadow darkened his eyes.\n\"Well, we all know what happened to\u2014\" And he mentioned three names\nthat had been household words in the middle of the century. They\nwere the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three\nphysicists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went on, \"A magician, on the other hand, tells people what they\nwish were true\u2014that perpetual motion works, that cancer can be cured\nby colored lights, that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold, that\nthey'll live forever. In good times magicians are laughed at. They're a\nluxury of the spoiled wealthy few. But in bad times people sell their\nsouls for magic cures, and buy perpetual motion machines to power their\nwar rockets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farquar clenched his fist. \"All the more reason to keep chipping away\nat the Thinkers. Are we supposed to beg off from a job because it's\ndifficult and dangerous?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Opperly shook his head. \"We're to keep clear of the infection of\nviolence. In my day, Willard, I was one of the Frightened Men. Later I\nwas one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair. Now I'm\nconvinced that all my reactions were futile.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Exactly!\" Farquar agreed harshly. \"You reacted. You didn't act. If\nyou men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league,\nif you'd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous\nbargaining position to demand the power to shape mankind's future....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By the time you were born, Willard,\" Opperly interrupted dreamily,\n\"Hitler was merely a name in the history books. We scientists weren't\nthe stuff out of which cloak-and-dagger men are made. Can you imagine\nOppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White\nHouse with a bomb in his briefcase?\" He smiled. \"Besides, that's not\nthe way power is seized. New ideas aren't useful to the man bargaining\nfor power\u2014only established facts or lies are.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just the same, it would have been a good thing if you'd had a little\nviolence in you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Opperly said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've got violence in me,\" Farquar announced, shoving himself to his\nfeet.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Opperly looked up from the flowers. \"I think you have,\" he agreed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what are we to do?\" Farquar demanded. \"Surrender the world to\ncharlatans without a struggle?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Opperly mused for a while. \"I don't know what the world needs now.\nEveryone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that\nhe spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the\nphilosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I leave that to history.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives. The fact that the\nThinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election.\nThe erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran\nbecause of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just\na cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of\n'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear.

For a moment the\nsilver-winged vision crowded everything else out of his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just think, a spaceship with sails! He smiled a bit, marveling at the\nparadox.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Direct atomic power. Direct utilization of the force of the flying\nneutrons. No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a\nsteam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust\u2014processes that\nwere as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself\nwarm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then\nwould come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella\nwould unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side\na gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick\nand backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the\nribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities.\nReaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the\nship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship\nitself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became\nexhausted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A spaceship with direct nuclear drive\u2014and he, a Thinker, had\nconceived it completely except for the technical details! Having\nstrengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting,\nmemory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself\nof the executive power to control the technicians and direct their\nspecialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind\nBomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer. They would\ndiscover the true laws of ESP and the inner life. They would even\u2014his\nimagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward\u2014build the\ntrue Maizie!\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the\nscientists. Rather, they'd be far ahead. No more deception.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry\nhim past his door. He stepped inside and called, \"Caddy!\" He waited a\nmoment, then walked through the apartment, but she wasn't there.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Confound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she\nshould have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now,\nwhen he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a\npleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He\nreally should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again\nthere sprang into his mind the word\u2014a pet form of her name\u2014that would\nsend her into obedient trance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment\nof crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike\nsuddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely\na wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding\nthe tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for\nit, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook\nhis perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if\nhe'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting\nTregarron.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his\nboss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the\nmumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He\nhimself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over\nstrategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum\nrelaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he\nknew would be desirable before the big conference.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "101", "uid": "586401e9268b4ce0b0d7846bff808bd9", "response_text": "Following World War III at the end of the 20th century, American society is dependent upon a machine created by the Thinker's Foundation; this machine, named Maizie, has the ability to answer any question posed to it, and it is used often by politicians and public figures for societal decision making.

As Jorj prepares for his day, he receives a call from the President, who is waiting to see Maizie. \nMaizie, a large computer with large panels, controls, indicators, and terminals occupies a two-story room in the Thinkers\u2019 Foundation, in which the President and members of his cabinet are waiting. It is described as many times more intelligent than humans, and was built by the Thinkers despite the skepticism of cyberneticists and scientists. The president, his secretary, two generals, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Space regard Maizie with reverence, speaking in hushed tones for fear that it could overhear them despite the knowledge that it only receives input from the ticker tape fed to it. Jorj enters onto the tape questions from the officials, before noticing an errant question, which he learns is from Morton Opperly\u2019s group of physicists. He feeds the tape to Maizie, which begins to emit a noise indicative of the start of its processes.\nAs they await Maizie\u2019s answers, Jorj directs their attention to a television screen broadcasting the launch of a rocket to Mars. We learn that Martians have imparted profound wisdom through the Thinkers to the world, which still suffers from the effects of the third world war. In response to the President\u2019s wish that Martians be brought to Earth to directly share their mental science, Jorj reminds him that only the Thinkers\u2019 minds can safely interact with the Martians\u2019. \nThe narrator reveals that inside Maizie is, rather than complicated machinery etching the edges of molecules to store information, a man who manually answers the input questions. He pauses when he reaches the question from Opperly\u2019s group, which asks if Maizie stands for Maelzel. He types out a response in the negative and continues. It is also revealed that the rocket launched for Mars only travels acutely beyond the ionosphere, rather than to its advertised destination. The astronaut, who is accompanied by his cat, reads about the knowledge which he would pass off as Martian wisdom upon his descent to Earth. \nMaizie has returned the output tape, and the Secretary of Space wonders aloud who Maelzel is.

Farquar suggests that the Thinkers are vulnerable because their technology does not exist and it would be easy to attack them. Opperly is concerned that the Thinkers may be able to buy Farquar off if they offer Caddy back to him. \n\nAt the end of the story, Jorj has plans to make sure the Thinkers no longer have to use deception.

While he does not agree with Farquar\u2019s desire to act upon their knowledge of the Thinkers\u2019 lies, he does call them animals. Farquar responds by saying that he feels like an animal because he feels trapped in a cage. Opperly believes it is not worth fighting with the Thinkers, but Farquar wants the fight and he wants violence.

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <h2>\n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n </h2>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [5]\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, it appears that\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  My sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then why don't they do that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\n  <i>\n   certain\n  </i>\n  that the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   What's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n  </i>\n  , I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't deny it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How much?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ten minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\n  <i>\n   average\n  </i>\n  velocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\n  <i>\n   DANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n  </i>\n  ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Political Survey Division\n  <i>\n   does\n  </i>\n  evaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  the spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\n  <i>\n   fast\n  </i>\n  ! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   First Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Second Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  [15]\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Third Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\n  <i>\n   responsible\n  </i>\n  human being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When I finally caught the beam from Ceres and set my flitterboat down\non the huge landing field that had been carved from the nickel-iron\nof the asteroid with a focused sun beam, I was itchy with my own\nperspiration and groggy tired. I don't like riding in flitterboats,\nsitting on a\n  [17]\n  bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a\nbroomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me\nand the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you\ncan't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until\nyou hit the next beacon station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ceres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon\nstation. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And\nexcept for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres,\nlock, stock, and mining rights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Part of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership.\nThere were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their\nhands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything\nshort of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to\nthat, too, before very long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ceres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody\nwould cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as\ndirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a\ngreat deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface\ngravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981,\nand that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly\nhampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds\non Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a\nstrain that takes a\n  [18]\n  week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in\nthe Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at\nleast an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them\nfrom growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense\ntakes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give\nyou a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by\nLanding Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the\ninner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his\nscarred, battered face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said,\nshaking his extended hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath\nand some sleep.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want\na drink?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By\ndefinition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions\nfollow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [19]\n </p>\n <p>\n  Colonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union\nsuit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was\na tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor\nseemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were\nshocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other\ncolors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of\nMidwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt.\nYou can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you\ndid, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle\nthat chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might\nhave to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels\ninside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are\nplaces where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away\nfrom his vac suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he\nclaimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually\ndue to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to\nthe colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid\nover. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the\nsuit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right;\nI wouldn't know, not being a psychologist.

Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\n  <br/>\n  pinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Starrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n  <i>\n   pirate\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which was right, in a way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\n  <i>\n   knew\n  </i>\n  what that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\n  <i>\n   heard\n  </i>\n  him say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  you? What are\nyou doing here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\n  <i>\n   Blade\nCosmian\n  </i>\n  ' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Devil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Between the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Star Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Star twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  And Devil Garrett died.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   What?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh-huh.

He also notices a person with another gun right after he murders that man. He almost kills this person as well, but is able to stop in time due to his strong reflex skills.

Then, he starts thinking of the girl again, but he does not really understand why he is thinking of her. Before he can do anything, he is taken from his cell. Standing 5 yards away from the gun that Garrett is holding, he tries to find a way that he could escape. He is glad to see that it is a two way transmitter, but loses his hope again when he realizes that it is an old-style transmitter.

Star cunningly kicks the metal fork onto the vision transmitter, which diverts Garrett\u2019s attention, and causes him to miss the shot. But because he is outnumbered by Garrett\u2019s men, he is caught and knocked out again. After he wake up, the girl finds him and tells him that she is capable of reading lips. Even though the visual images has no sound, she knows what the Section Void Headquarters said, and that he is the actual Star. \n\nGarrett enters the cell after he finds out that the girl knows the real identity of him and Star.

Confused as to how such a powerful beam could have been shot on this planet, Star is met with one of Garrett's armed men. Star attacks the man and sees a girl, who he is perplexed by. The girl threatens him, and Star replies by explaining that he's not a pirate, but Death Star. The girl immediately attacks him, knocking him out.

Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet.

Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the\n  <i>\n   Mare Serenitatis\n  </i>\n  covered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" I conceded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say\n  <i>\n   steel\n  </i>\n  because it's\n  <i>\n   similar\n  </i>\n  to steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's\n  <i>\n   at least\n  </i>\n  several thousand years\nold.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  We slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\n  <i>\n   must\n  </i>\n  be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Briefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\n  <i>\n   Something\n  </i>\n  pushed me!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you all right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n </p>\n <p>\n  ... and struck an invisible solid wall.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  My eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   What happened?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   What?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miller!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miller, get help!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened to him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Static grated against my ear drums.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Static!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over\n  <i>\n   our\n  </i>\n  radio, unless\u2014\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite\u2014\"unless we were in outer space!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I deactivated my radio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door closed behind him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I put my arms around her, held her close.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Six doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tasted a small piece.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sat next to Verana.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened?\" my wife asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe\n  <i>\n   oddest\n  </i>\n  feeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  search my mind and gather information. I could actually\n  <i>\n   feel\n  </i>\n  it search my memories!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What memories?\" I inquired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Kane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"\n  <i>\n   Do you know where we are?\n  </i>\n  \" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\n  <i>\n   like rabbits in a snare!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Verana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\n  <i>\n   have to\n  </i>\n  dissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Verana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\n  <i>\n   Who\n  </i>\n  are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Six rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After intensive searching, we realized there was\n  <i>\n   no way\n  </i>\n  to damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We gave up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You sure?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Does\n  </i>\n  every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  My resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Whiskey!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Why?\n  </i>\n  \" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Solution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\n  <i>\n   And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Awake, huh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I grunted my disgust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions.

One evening, Ed and his wife Verana, along with Miller, Harry Kane and his wife Marie, decide to take a leisurely stroll on the Moon's surface. As they walk along the path, they stumble upon a strange large object, a spherical figure of metal that, according to Kane, an experienced mineralogist, was several thousand years old. As the group examines the object, they notice an opening forming on its surface. Kane climbs through the opening and convinces the rest of the group to follow him. As Miller climbs through the opening, he is suddenly pushed back onto the ground as the opening shuts, locking the four inside the object. They soon lose connection in their intercoms and realize that the static they hear is due to the fact that the object is beginning to move through outer space.

As they reach the end of the corridor, two doors open as Marie and Kane are shoved into separate rooms. Ed and Verana, now alone, walk back down the corridor where six rooms are open, finding strange food, games, and an observatory. Marie returns in a trance, saying that a telepathic voice had reached out to her in the room and searched her memories. Kane walks in shortly after, enraged, explaining that aliens had taken the group captive after planting the object on the Moon as a booby trap; they are to be on the ship for six months and be experimented on as members of the human race. Kane suggests that the group find a way to take control of the ship, when a mysterious voice fills the room, discouraging him. The voice explains that it is a machine located in the ship, and that its masters want to study the group to fulfill their curiosity about humans.

Moreover, both are rather interested in the aliens and support each other all the way, their couple is harmonious, especially on the contrast."}]}]}

Earth Flight 21 was a\n  <br/>\n  suicide run, a coffin ship, they told him.\n  <br/>\n  Uranian death lay athwart the space lanes. But\n  <br/>\n  Shano already knew this was his last ride.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Fall 1949.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Mercurian night settled black and thick over the Q City Spaceport.\nTentative fingers of light flicked and probed the sky, and winked out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here she comes,\" somebody in the line ahead said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, his whole skeletal body jerking. Arthritic joints sent\nflashes of pain along his limbs. Here she comes, he thought, feeling\nneither glad nor sad.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He coughed and slipped polarized goggles over his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The spaceport emerged bathed in infra red. Hangars, cradles, freighter\ncatapults and long runways stood out in sharp, diamond-clear detail.\nHigh up, beyond the cone of illumination, a detached triple row of\nbright specks\u2014portholes of the liner\n  <i>\n   Stardust\n  </i>\n  \u2014sank slowly down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no eagerness in him. Only a tiredness. A relief. Relief from\na lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting,\nlugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home\nto die.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long\nshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery\nsnuggle into the cradle's ribs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Stardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All\npassengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following\naround the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard\nstubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the\nvanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing\ndesire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Attention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The\nsignal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five\nminutes.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking\nShano aside as he passed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Red signal.\n  </i>\n  In bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\nrisk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\nPlucking at an urgency there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Flight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n  </i>\n  ,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The loud-speaker blared. \"\n  <i>\n   Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking\u2014\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\nshut off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Captain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing\nbriefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\nsquared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out\nthere. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was\ndriv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears\nthings, a laborer does.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own\nrisk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\nWhen the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few\nhours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\naboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\nwatchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some,\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto.\nWhere a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain,\nwhat's a notched jaw mean to you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him\naround. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\nyour cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Descending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\nman turned and gripped Shano's thin arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name\n  <i>\n   Rourke\n  </i>\n  . \"Why are you so\nanxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's\ntrouble ahead, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\nsluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled\ndown the steel deck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\nwaited.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A bell clanged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\n  <i>\n   Emergency. Battle posts.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fire number seven.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\n  <i>\n   Stardust\n  </i>\n  out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold fire.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stand by.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\n  <i>\n   Stardust\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano blinked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Giddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   Stardust's\n  </i>\n  mechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano smoked and thought.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They wouldn't even know, he told himself, squirming through the\nemergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And they\nwouldn't understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxia\ngas. Shano coughed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The guts\nof the space ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from\na fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working\naway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down\npins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his\nhands, and shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One try,\" he said to himself. \"One try, Shano. One important thing in\nyour life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It'll\nkill you at this concentration. But you'll last for maybe twelve hours.\nAnother man wouldn't last a minute. Another man's lungs aren't clogged\nwith Juno gum.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slipped\nthe forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well,\nmaybe not going home. Couldn't remember what Earth looked like anyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What was that again? Oh yeah\u2014just lift them up, and when they drop\noff, lift them up again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back\nsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, \"Pop, pop,\" behind him and\nmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another\njerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and\nlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank\nthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,\nthe way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then\nlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting\npain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard the\nhigh, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinery\ngo. He was running the cosmic drive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A bell clanged somewhere. \"Engine room! Engine room! We're under way!\nWhat happened?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silence, while Shano coughed and made the machinery go, thinking about\nthe Earth he hadn't seen for many years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain!\" the speaker bawled. \"There's a man in there! Working the\nvalve rods! Somebody is in the engine room and the gas isn't....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shano grinned, feeling good. Feeling happy. Lifting the heavy steel\nrods, driving the ship. Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling the\nliner\n  <i>\n   Stardust\n  </i>\n  toward Venus. He wondered if they'd found Rourke yet.\nIf he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. After\nthat....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Home,\" he coughed. \"Hell! Who wants to go home?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranian\nfleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippled\nship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano.\nA useless old man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Coughing came out all mixed up with laughing.\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "48897558f4ca46c09041d3ca9f306a4b", "response_text": "Shano is a sickly old man in line to board the space liner Stardust to go home. There is a red signal announcement for the liner, and guests are given an option to receive a refund. Many guests leave after hearing the danger signal, but Shano sticks his ticket into the scanner and moves to get on the liner. Shano chooses to step in anyways despite the dangers, and the Stardust takes off into space again. Captain Menthlo informs him of the Uranian enemy fleets and the high possibility of running into danger with one of them. When the captain realizes Shano's role as a laborer, he makes him sign a waiver because of the possible danger his life will be when they shut off the ship and mechanical device to avoid the enemies. Once he exits to the next deck, he sees the same lieutenant from earlier speak to him again. The lieutenant's name is  Rourke, and he asks why Shano is so anxious to board the ship. Later, as Shano smokes in his cabin, he tries to remember the specific saying for people with nicked jaws. Later, the ship announces that it will now maintain dead silence mode to avoid the Uranian fleets. Shano leaves his room to follow one of the young ensign, who walks by with a blaster. He then realizes that he cannot go back to his room. However, he sees an indistinguishable figure enter the engine room and notices a grey box with switches. Not soon after, the ship enters an offensive attack mode because the Uranian fleets have noticed them. Shano suddenly remembers the rumors to watch out for a man with a nicked jaw because he sells out information to Uranus. He knows that nobody will believe him about a traitor on the ship, so he faces Rourke himself. Shano digs his cigarette into the other man's body and clings to his body. He then twists Rourke's neck with his hands and kills the traitor. The frantic yelling of the other members catches his attention again, and the Stardust informs everybody on board that the ship is midway to Venus. However, there is toxic gas in the engine room now, and nobody on board can withstand the fumes to fix the engines. Although Shano continues to smoke, he does go into the engine room through the emergency exit to fix the space liner. The other crew on the ship are confused by how the liner continues to fly towards Venus. They realize that Shano is working the valve rods in the engine room. Shano thinks about how the Uranian fleet will come into the area and expect to find the Starliner but only find nothing. The fact that this escape is because of him makes him laugh and cough more.

Shano has gum-clogged lungs, and it was quite an advantage to him when working inside the mines.

Shano, desired to go home, decides to take this risk. \n\nHe is the only passenger aboard along with the crew members. The captain of the ship, Menthlo, told him that there is a Uranian fleet on their way. He warns Shano that they will turn the ship off later to avoid detection, and tells him to stay in his cabin. After he sees the kicked jaw of Rourke, the lieutenant of the ship, he heads towards his cabin, where he lays and thinks about the rumors he has heard about nicked jaws. Then captain\u2019s voice comes through the speaker, telling everyone to shut down all machineries and maintain dead silence because the Uranians are listening for mechanical and electronic disturbance. Feeling anxious in his cabin, Shano follows a young man down to the Engine Room. Pausing after seeing a specious figure going into the room, he sees a gray box. Even though everything becomes silent, they are detected by the Uranians. The battle begins. He once again notices the gray box and that the needle inside did not stop, thus he assumes that someone planted it there to make sure the Uranians discover them \u2013 a man sold them out. He immediately assumes that it is the nicked jaw man, he is up to something. Then, after spotting the nicked jaw man suspiciously leaving the emergency door, Rourke, Shano digs the cigarette into his face, and grasps his neck until he stops breathing and drops dead. Then he learns from the captain that a selector has been smashed, and in order to fix it, one has to enter the Engine Room which is filled with toxia gas. He knows that his gum-clogged lungs is able to slow down he consumption of the toxia gas in comparison to other people who breaths the gas. Thus, he enters the Engine Room, and starts to work on the selector. Leaving the captain and the crew in shock, they are finally on their way again.

He boards the ship with a lieutenant with the notch on his jaw named Rourke, onboard he meets the captain, who advises him to stay in his cabin. The captain informs him that there is a hostile Uranian fleet waiting for them on their path, and they will have to turn all power off during the journey.

Shano goes to his cabin, and the ship goes dark. He opens his doors and walks down the corridor. He sees a figure disappear into the engine room. Suddenly, the captain's voice rings through the intercom. The ship has been spotted by the Uranians, a battle ensues. The crew of the Stardust win this round. Shano notices an electric signal box, which tells of the ships position. He realises something. He remembers what he had heard about the man with the notch on his jaw sold the crew out to Uranus. It was Rourke. Rourke arrives, and Shano attacks him, swiftly killing him. The captain's voice flashes once again that there is an emergency in the engine room. The ship has been hit and everything is dead. Someone has broken through the engine room and it has filled with toxic gas. More Uranian ships are coming, and there's no way to repair the tear in the engine room without being poisoned by the gas. They are stranded.

He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n </p>\n 10\n <p>\n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n </p>\n 11\n <p>\n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201c\n  <i>\n   Some\n  </i>\n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n </p>\n 12\n <p>\n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"tb\">\n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n </p>\n 13\n <p>\n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir.

He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n </p>\n 14\n <p>\n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n </p>\n 15\n <p>\n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n </p>\n 16\n <p>\n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n </p>\n 17\n <p>\n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n </p>\n 18\n <p>\n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n  <i>\n   This was it.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n </p>\n 19\n <p>\n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n </p>\n 20\n <p>\n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n </p>\n 21\n <p>\n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n </p>\n 22\n <p>\n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n </p>\n 23\n <p>\n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n </p>\n 24\n <p>\n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n </p>\n 25\n <p>\n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n </p>\n 26\n <p>\n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n </p>\n 27\n <p>\n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n </p>\n 28\n <p>\n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n </p>\n 29\n <p>\n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n </p>\n 30\n <p>\n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches.

But from seaward the waves chopped in, sprinkling his\ntrousers to the knees and making him wince pleasurably at the thought\nof what vast wings of spray and towers of solid water must crash up\nfrom here in a storm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He crossed the rocks at a trot, ran up a short grassy slope, raced\nthrough a fringe of trees\u2014and came straight up against an eight-foot\nfence of heavy mesh topped with barbed wire and backed at a short\ndistance with high, heavy shrubbery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without pausing for surprise\u2014in fact, in his holiday mood, using\nsurprise as a goad\u2014he jumped for the branch of an oak whose trunk\ntouched the fence, scorning the easier lower branch on the other side\nof the tree. Then he drew himself up, worked his way to some higher\nbranches that crossed the fence, and dropped down inside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly cautious, he gently parted the shrubbery and, before the first\nsurprise could really sink in, had another.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  A closely mown lawn dotted with more shrubbery ran up to a snug white\nCape Cod cottage. The single strand of a radio aerial stretched the\nlength of the roof. Parked on a neat gravel driveway that crossed just\nin front of the cottage was a short, square-lined touring car that he\nrecognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The whole\nscene had about it the same odd quietness as the cove.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, the white door\nopened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, lace-edged\ndress and wide, lacy hat. She climbed into the driver's seat of the\nEssex, sitting there very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug\nbravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off between the trees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door of the house opened again and a slim girl emerged. She wore a\nwhite silk dress that fell straight from square neck-line to hip-height\nwaistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her dark hair was bound\nwith a white bandeau so that it curved close to her cheeks. A dark\nnecklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked\nunder her arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on a rattan table\nbetween three rattan chairs and stood watching a squirrel zigzag across\nthe lawn.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The man stepped through the wall of shrubbery, called, \"hello!\" and\nwalked toward her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She whirled around and stared at him as still as if her heart had\nstopped beating. Then she darted behind the table and waited for him\nthere. Granting the surprise of his appearance, her alarm seemed not\nso much excessive as eerie. As if, the man thought, he were not an\nordinary stranger, but a visitor from another planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Approaching closer, he saw that she was trembling and that her breath\nwas coming in rapid, irregular gasps. Yet the slim, sweet, patrician\nface that stared into his had an underlying expression of expectancy\nthat reminded him of the cove. She couldn't have been more than\neighteen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped short of the table. Before he could speak, she stammered\nout, \"Are you he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\" he asked, smiling puzzledly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The one who sends me the little boxes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was out sailing and I happened to land in the far cove. I didn't\ndream that anyone lived on this island, or even came here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No one ever does come here,\" she replied. Her manner had changed,\nbecoming at once more wary and less agitated, though still eerily\ncurious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It startled me tremendously to find this place,\" he blundered on.\n\"Especially the road and the car. Why, this island can't be more than a\nquarter of a mile wide.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The road goes down to the wharf,\" she explained, \"and up to the top of\nthe island, where my aunts have a tree-house.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tore his mind away from the picture of a woman dressed like Queen\nMary clambering up a tree. \"Was that your aunt I saw driving off?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One of them. The other's taken the motorboat in for supplies.\" She\nlooked at him doubtfully. \"I'm not sure they'll like it if they find\nsomeone here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are just the three of you?\" he cut in quickly, looking down the\nempty road that vanished among the oaks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose you go in to the mainland with your aunts quite often?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She shook her head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It must get pretty dull for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not very,\" she said, smiling. \"My aunts bring me the papers and other\nthings. Even movies. We've got a projector. My favorite stars are\nAntonio Morino and Alice Terry. I like her better even than Clara Bow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at her hard for a moment. \"I suppose you read a lot?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded. \"Fitzgerald's my favorite author.\" She started around the\ntable, hesitated, suddenly grew shy. \"Would you like some lemonade?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He'd noticed the dewed silver pitcher, but only now realized his\nthirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untasted and said\nawkwardly, \"I haven't introduced myself. I'm Jack Barry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her own\ntoward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. \"I'm a biology student. Been\nworking at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here\nto do research in marine ecology\u2014that's sort of sea-life patterns\u2014of\nthe in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich. You\nknow about him, of course?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She shook her head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Probably the greatest living biologist,\" he was proud to inform\nher. \"Human physiology as well. Tremendous geneticist. In a class\nwith Carlson and Jacques Loeb. Martin Kesserich\u2014he lives over there\nat town. I'm staying with him. You ought to have heard of him.\" He\ngrinned. \"Matter of fact, I'd never have met you if it hadn't been for\nMrs. Kesserich.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl looked puzzled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack explained, \"The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences,\nwon't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow.\nWhen I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich\u2014she's a drab sort of\nperson\u2014said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of\ncourse, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as\nif she were saying it for the first time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're pretty shy, aren't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How would I know?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this\nstrangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to\ntalk. \"I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I never go to the mainland.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean you stay out here all winter?\" he asked incredulously, his\nmind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are\nvery capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help\nthem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But that's impossible!\" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. \"You\ncan't be shut off this way from people your own age!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or\na man before, except in movies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're joking!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, it's true.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why\nare they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She seemed to have gained poise from his loss of it. \"I don't know\nwhy. I'm to find out soon. But actually I'm not lonely. May I tell\nyou a secret?\" She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest\ntrembling. \"Every night the loneliness gathers in around me\u2014you're\nright about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a\nlittle box.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that?\" he said sharply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures,\nor flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the\npoems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,\n </p>\n 'Ah, love, let us be true\n To one another! for the world, which seems\n To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n So various, so beautiful, so new,\n Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n Nor certitude\u2014'\"\n <p>\n  \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how are the notes signed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd\nimagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, but how are they signed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And so when you first saw me, you thought\u2014\" He began, then stopped\nbecause she was blushing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long have you been getting them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new\nones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how does this\u2014person get these boxes to you out here? Does he\ngive them to your aunts and do they put them there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how can they get them in winter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look here,\" he said, pouring himself more lemonade, \"how long is it\nsince you've been to the mainland?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Almost eighteen years. My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle\nof the war.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What war?\" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The World War, of course. What's the matter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind\nof terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him\nhad changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders,\nthe same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his\nnostrils. He could still hear the faint\n  <i>\n   chop-chop\n  </i>\n  of the waves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape\nglimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to\na sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the\nnewspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read:\n </p>\n <p>\n  HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Foes of Machado Riot in Havana\n </p>\n <p>\n  Big NRA Parade Planned\n </p>\n <p>\n  Balbo Speaks in New York\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Suddenly he felt a surge of relief. He had noticed that the paper was\nyellow and brittle-edged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why are you so interested in old newspapers?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,\" the girl objected,\npointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're trying to joke,\" Jack told her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I'm not.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it's 1953.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now it's you who are joking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But the paper's yellow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The paper's always yellow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He laughed uneasily. \"Well, if you actually think it's 1933, perhaps\nyou're to be envied,\" he said, with a sardonic humor he didn't quite\nfeel. \"Then you can't know anything about the Second World War, or\ntelevision, or the V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or the atomic bomb,\nor\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop!\" She had sprung up and retreated around her chair, white-faced.\n\"I don't like what you're saying.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, please! Jokes that may be quite harmless on the mainland sound\ndifferent here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm really not joking,\" he said after a moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She grew quite frantic at that. \"I can show you all last week's papers!\nI can show you magazines and other things. I can prove it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She started toward the house. He followed. He felt his heart begin to\npound.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the white door she paused, looking worriedly down the road. Jack\nthought he could hear the faint\n  <i>\n   chug\n  </i>\n  of a motorboat. She pushed open\nthe door and he followed her inside. The small-windowed room was dark\nafter the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a\nfireplace with brass andirons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Flash!\" croaked a gritty voice. \"After their disastrous break day\nbefore yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his arm\naround the girl's shoulders. At the same time he noticed that the voice\nwas coming from the curved brown trumpet of an old-fashioned radio\nloudspeaker.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl didn't pull away from him. He turned toward her. Although her\ngray eyes were on him, her attention had gone elsewhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can hear the car. They're coming back. They won't like it that\nyou're here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right they won't like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her agitation grew. \"No, you must go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll come back tomorrow,\" he heard himself saying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Flash! It looks as if the World Economic Conference may soon adjourn,\nmouthing jeers at old Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle\nShylock.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack felt a numbness on his neck. The room seemed to be darkening, the\ngirl growing stranger still.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must go before they see you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Flash! Wiley Post has just completed his solo circuit of the Globe,\nafter a record-breaking flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes.\nAsked how he felt after the energy-draining feat, Post quipped....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He was halfway across the lawn before he realized the terror into which\nthe grating radio voice had thrown him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He leaped for the branch over-hanging the fence, vaulted up with the\nrisky help of a foot on the barbed top. A surprised squirrel, lacking\ntime to make its escape up the trunk, sprang to the ground ahead of\nhim. With terrible suddenness, two steel-jawed semicircles clanked\ntogether just over the squirrel's head. Jack landed with one foot to\neither side of the sprung trap, while the squirrel darted off with a\nsqueak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack plunged down the slope to the rocky spine and ran across it, spray\nfrom the rising waves spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he\nstumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought\nhis way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line\nof the\n  <i>\n   Annie O.\n  </i>\n  , dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could,\nplunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled\naboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As soon as the\n  <i>\n   Annie O.\n  </i>\n  was nosing out of the cove into the cross\nwaves, he yanked up the sail. The freshening wind filled it and sent\nthe sloop heeling over, with inches of white water over the lee rail,\nand plunging ahead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the wind\nand the waves and the sail and speed and danger, to have all his\nattention taken up balancing one against the other, so that he wouldn't\nhave to ask himself what year it was and whether time was an illusion,\nand wonder about flappers and hidden traps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he finally looked back at the island, he was amazed to see how\ntiny it had grown, as distant as the mainland.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he saw a gray motorboat astern. He watched it as it slowly\novertook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in\nthe bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair\nthat whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that\nit was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches\nover the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to\nthe roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves\ndrenching over it, and headed back toward the island. He watched it for\na minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross\nhis bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail,\nwatching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him. Then he turned\nand gratefully followed the dark, wide, fanlike sterns and age-yellowed\nsails.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home\u2014a weathered white cube with\nnarrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola\u2014was nothing like its\nlavish interior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming\nfurniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same\nflat-bosomed dress\u2014flowered rather than white\u2014no bandeau, same beads.\nSame proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat\nvoice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question\u2014he\nwas much too dazed for that\u2014he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him\u2014or rather about the three of\nthem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud\u2014I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant\u2014and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The great biologist had come home.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment.

Awestruck, Jack heads towards the island and comes across a barbed fence, and beyond it, a cottage. He watches as a woman dressed in a long lace dress enters a car in the driveway and drives off. He then sees a girl in a white dress come out of the cottage, holding a newspaper. Jack approaches the girl, startling her, and she asks him whether he is the man who has been sending her boxes. Jack asks the girl questions, revealing that the woman from earlier is the girl's aunt, who brings her newspapers and other things from the mainland while she remains on the island.

Mrs. Kesserich explains that Mary Alice Pope was Martin's fiancee, who died in an accident in 1933; Martin was intensely in love with her, but his sisters disliked her, and one night while waiting for Martin to arrive by train, she fell into the tracks and was killed. Suddenly, Martin enters, eager to tell Jack about his new discoveries about recreating individuals; specifically, about how it could be achieved if you replicated environments for both individuals.

In fact, when Jack tries to explain to Mary Alice that she is being manipulated, she uses the old newspapers as her own proof that she is truly in 1933."}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "a2010e90befa435ab2e0b3b6a9ad664e", "response_text": "Newspapers are an important part of the story because they reveal the lies told to Mary Alice. When she first meets Jack, she shows him the yellowed newspaper and says that it is the morning news from the day before yesterday. When Jack points out that the paper is from many years ago, she refuses to believe him and even implies that he is lying to her. The newspapers also help lead Jack to ask Mrs. Kesserich about Mary Alice Pope and why she believes she is living in 1933. Later, the newspaper from present-day that Jack buys finally convinces Mary Alice that she is living in a simulated lie. Although she is initially suspicious, he does manage to make her see the truth and question why the people around her would lie to her.

They are also the way Jack learns about her being tricked. He proves his point of it being the year 1953 also by bringing newspapers. Mary's newspapers are yellow which proves their age. The tool for creating the lie and the tool for destroying it is the same in the story. With the help of contemporary newspapers, Jack is able to convince the girl to believe him and to save her from deception. The whole plan of the professor is ruined mainly because of the newspapers.

A 40 credit tour is no substitute!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The picture changed on the illuminated panel that filled the forward\nend of the shelf on which Michael lay. A haggard blonde woman sprawled\napathetically in a chair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rundown, nervous, hypertensive?\" inquired a mellifluous voice. \"In\nneed of mental therapy? Buy Grugis juice; it's not expensive. And they\nswear by it on Merop\u00e9.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A disembodied pair of hands administered a spoonful of Grugis juice to\nthe woman, whereupon her hair turned bright yellow, makeup bloomed on\nher face, her clothes grew briefer, and she burst into a fast Callistan\nclog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see from your hair that you have been a member of one of the\nBrotherhoods,\" the passenger lying next to Michael on the shelf\nremarked inquisitively. He was a middle-aged man, his dust-brown hair\nthinning on top, his small blue eyes glittering preternaturally from\nthe lenses fitted over his eyeballs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael rubbed his fingers ruefully over the blond stubble on his scalp\nand wished he had waited until his tonsure were fully grown before\nhe had ventured out into the world. But he had been so impatient to\nleave the Lodge, so impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the\nBrotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world\nthat had seemed so glamorous and now proved so itchy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" he replied courteously, for he knew the first rule of universal\nbehavior, \"I have been a Brother.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now why would a good-looking young fellow like you want to join a\nBrotherhood?\" his shelf companion wanted to know. \"Trouble over a\nfemale?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael shook his head, smiling. \"No, I have been a member of the\nAngeleno Brotherhood since I was an infant. My father brought me when\nhe entered.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other man clucked sympathetically. \"No doubt he was grieved over\nthe death of your mother.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael closed his eyes to shut out the sight of a baby protruding its\nfat face at him three-dimensionally, but he could not shut out its\nlisping voice: \"Does your child refuse its food, grow wizened like a\nmonkey? It will grow plump with oh-so-good Mealy Mush from Nunki.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir,\" Michael replied. \"Father said that was one of the few\nblessings that brightened an otherwise benighted life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Horror contorted his fellow traveller's plump features. \"Be careful,\nyoung man!\" he warned. \"Lucky for you that you are talking to someone\nas broad-minded as I, but others aren't. You might be reported for\nviolating a tabu. An Earth tabu, moreover.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An Earth tabu?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly. Motherhood is sacred here on Earth and so, of course, in\nthe entire United Universe. You should have known that.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Michael blushed. He should indeed. For a year prior to his leaving the\nLodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe\nso that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself,\nwith confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all\nthe customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all\nthe other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before\nthat wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing\nwith them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the\nsame laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no\ndifferences, and hence no wars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years\nthere had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and\nplenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar\nsystems\u2014injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths\nof Aldebaran were still trying to add\n  <i>\n   thought\n  </i>\n  to the statute).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any\nreason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to\nretire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive\nforefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had,\nperhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the\nworld. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's\nface upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the\npast\u2014the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal\nfurnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Father Superior had smiled. \"You are not yet a fully fledged\nBrother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved\nyour majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why\ndon't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying\nthe ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because\nhe had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his\npreparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A large scarlet pencil jumped merrily across the advideo screen. The\nface on the eraser opened its mouth and sang: \"Our pencils are finest\nfrom point up to rubber, for the lead is from Yed, while the wood comes\nfrom Dschubba.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Is there any way of turning that thing off?\" Michael wanted to know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other man smiled. \"If there were, my boy, do you think anybody\nwould watch it? Furthermore, turning it off would violate the spirit of\nfree enterprise. We wouldn't want that, would we?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, no!\" Michael agreed hastily. \"Certainly not.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And it might hurt the advertiser's feelings, cause him ego injury.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How could I ever have had such a ridiculous idea?\" Michael murmured,\nabashed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" said his companion. \"My name is\nPierce B. Carpenter. Aphrodisiacs are my line. Here's my card.\" He\nhanded Michael a transparent tab with the photograph of Mr. Carpenter\nsuspended inside, together with his registration number, his name, his\naddress, and the Universal seal of approval. Clearly he was a character\nof the utmost respectability.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My name's Michael Frey,\" the young man responded, smiling awkwardly.\n\"I'm afraid I don't have any cards.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, you wouldn't have had any use for them where you were. Now,\nlook here, son,\" Carpenter went on in a lowered voice, \"I know you've\njust come from the Lodge and the mistakes you'll make will be through\nignorance rather than deliberate malice. But the police wouldn't\nunderstand. You know what the sacred writings say: 'Ignorance of The\nLaw is no excuse.' I'd be glad to give you any little tips I can. For\ninstance, your hands....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael spread his hands out in front of him. They were perfectly good\nhands, he thought. \"Is there something wrong with them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter blushed and looked away. \"Didn't you know that on Electra it\nis forbidden for anyone to appear in public with his hands bare?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course I know that,\" Michael said impatiently. \"But what's that got\nto do with me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The salesman was wide-eyed. \"But if it is forbidden on Electra, it\nbecomes automatically prohibited here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But Electrans have eight fingers on each hand,\" Michael protested,\n\"with two fingernails on each\u2014all covered with green scales.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter drew himself up as far as it was possible to do so while\nlying down. \"Do eight fingers make one a lesser Universal?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not, but\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is he inferior to you then because he has sixteen fingernails?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly not, but\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would you like to be called guilty of\u2014\" Carpenter paused before the\ndreaded word\u2014\"\n  <i>\n   intolerance\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no,\n  <i>\n   no\n  </i>\n  !\" Michael almost shrieked. It would be horrible for him\nto be arrested before he even had time to view Portyork. \"I have lots\nof gloves in my pack,\" he babbled. \"Lots and lots. I'll put some on\nright away.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  With nervous haste, he pressed the lever which dropped his pack down\nfrom the storage compartment. It landed on his stomach. The device had\nbeen invented by one of the Dschubbans who are, as everyone knows,\nhoop-shaped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael pushed the button marked\n  <i>\n   Gloves A\n  </i>\n  , and a pair of yellow\ngauntlets slid out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter pressed his hands to his eyes. \"Yellow is the color of death\non Saturn, and you know how morbid the Saturnians are about passing\naway! No one\n  <i>\n   ever\n  </i>\n  wears yellow!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry,\" Michael said humbly. The button marked\n  <i>\n   Gloves B\n  </i>\n  yielded a\npair of rose-colored gloves which harmonized ill with his scarlet tunic\nand turquoise breeches, but he was past caring for esthetic effects.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The quality's high,\" sang a quartet of beautiful female humanoids,\n\"but the price is meager. You\n  <i>\n   know\n  </i>\n  when you buy Plummy Fruitcake from\nVega.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The salesman patted Michael's shoulder. \"You staying a while in\nPortyork?\" Michael nodded. \"Then you'd better stick close to me for a\nwhile until you learn our ways. You can't run around loose by yourself\nuntil you've acquired civilized behavior patterns, or you'll get into\ntrouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thank you, sir,\" Michael said gratefully. \"It's very kind of you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He twisted himself around\u2014it was boiling hot inside the jet bus\nand his damp clothes were clinging uncomfortably\u2014and struck his\nhead against the bottom of the shelf above. \"Awfully inconvenient\narrangement here,\" he commented. \"Wonder why they don't have seats.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because this arrangement,\" Carpenter said stiffly, \"is the one that\nhas proved suitable for the greatest number of intelligent life-forms.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I see,\" Michael murmured. \"I didn't get a look at the other\npassengers. Are there many extraterrestrials on the bus?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dozens of them. Haven't you heard the Sirians singing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A low moaning noise had been pervading the bus, but Michael had thought\nit arose from defective jets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, yes!\" he agreed. \"And very beautiful it is, too! But so sad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sirians are always sad,\" the salesman told him. \"Listen.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Michael strained his ears past the racket of the advideo. Sure enough,\nhe could make out words: \"Our wings were unfurled in a far distant\nworld, our bodies are pain-racked, delirious. And never, it seems, will\nwe see, save in dreams, the bright purple swamps of our Sirius....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter brushed away a tear. \"Poignant, isn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very, very touching,\" Michael agreed. \"Are they sick or something?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, no; they wouldn't have been permitted on the bus if they were.\nThey're just homesick. Sirians love being homesick. That's why they\nleave Sirius in such great numbers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fasten your suction disks, please,\" the stewardess, a pretty\ntwo-headed Denebian, ordered as she walked up and down the gangway.\n\"We're coming into Portyork. I have an announcement to make to all\npassengers on behalf of the United Universe. Zosma was admitted into\nthe Union early this morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  All the passengers cheered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Since it is considered immodest on Zosma,\" she continued, \"ever to\nappear with the heads bare, henceforward it will be tabu to be seen in\npublic without some sort of head-covering.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wild scrabbling sounds indicated that all the passengers were searching\ntheir packs for headgear. Michael unearthed a violet cap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The salesmen unfolded what looked like a medieval opera hat in\npiercingly bright green.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Always got to keep on your toes,\" he whispered to the younger man.\n\"The Universe is expanding every minute.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bus settled softly on the landing field and the passengers flew,\nfloated, crawled, undulated, or walked out. Michael looked around him\ncuriously. The Lodge had contained no extraterrestrials, for such of\nthose as sought seclusion had Brotherhoods on their own planets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, even in Angeles he had seen other-worlders\u2014humanoids from\nVega, scaly Electrans, the wispy ubiquitous Sirians\u2014but nothing to\ncompare with the crowds that surged here. Scarlet Meropians rubbed\ntentacles with bulging-eyed Talithans; lumpish gray Jovians plodded\nalongside graceful, spidery Nunkians. And there were countless others\nwhom he had seen pictured in books, but never before in reality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gaily colored costumes and bodies of these beings rendered\nkaleidoscopic a field already brilliant with red-and-green lights and\nbanners. The effect was enhanced by Mr. Carpenter, whose emerald-green\ncloak was drawn back to reveal a chartreuse tunic and olive-green\nbreeches which had apparently been designed for a taller and somewhat\nless pudgy man.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. \"I have no immediate\nbusiness, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would you\nlike to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Frankly,\" Michael admitted, \"the first thing I'd like to do is get\nmyself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.\"\nTwo small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously and\nscuttled off on six legs apiece.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shh, not so loud! There are females present.\" Carpenter drew the\nyouth to a secluded corner. \"Don't you know that on Theemim it's\nfrightfully vulgar to as much as speak of eating in public?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why?\" Michael demanded in too loud a voice. \"What's wrong with\neating in public here on Earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter clapped a hand over the young man's mouth. \"Hush,\" he\ncautioned. \"After all, on Earth there are things we don't do or even\nmention in public, aren't there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, yes. But those are different.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not at all. Those rules might seem just as ridiculous to a Theemimian.\nBut the Theemimians have accepted our customs just as we have accepted\nthe Theemimians'. How would you like it if a Theemimian violated\none of our tabus in public? You must consider the feelings of the\nTheemimians as equal to your own. Observe the golden rule: 'Do unto\nextraterrestrials as you would be done by.'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I'm still hungry,\" Michael persisted, modulating his voice,\nhowever, to a decent whisper. \"Do the proprieties demand that I starve\nto death, or can I get something to eat somewhere?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Naturally,\" the salesman whispered back. \"Portyork provides for all\nbodily needs. Numerous feeding stations are conveniently located\nthroughout the port, and there must be some on the field.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females were\nwatching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field and\npressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the nearest one,\" Carpenter explained.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Inside a small, white, functional-looking building unobtrusively\nmarked \"Feeding Station,\" Carpenter showed Michael where to insert a\ntwo-credit piece in a slot. A door slid back and admitted Michael into\na tiny, austere room, furnished only with a table, a chair, a food\ncompartment, and an advideo. The food consisted of tabloid synthetics\nand was tasteless. Michael knew that only primitive creatures waste\ntime and energy in growing and preparing natural foods. It was all a\nmatter of getting used to this stuff, he thought glumly, as he tried to\nchew food that was meant to be gulped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A ferret-eyed Yeddan appeared on the advideo. \"Do you suffer from\ngastric disorders? Does your viscera get in your hair? A horrid\ncondition, but swift abolition is yours with Al-Brom from Altair.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael finished his meal in fifteen minutes and left the compartment\nto find Carpenter awaiting him in the lobby, impatiently glancing at\nthe luminous time dial embedded in his wrist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go to the Old Town,\" he suggested to Michael. \"It will be of\ngreat interest to a student and a newcomer like yourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few yards away from the feeding station, the travel agents were lined\nup in rows, each outside his spaceship, each shouting the advantages of\nthe tour he offered:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better than a mustard plaster is a weekend spent on Castor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you want to show you like her, take her for a week to Spica.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Movid stars go to Mars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter smiled politely at them. \"No space trips for us today,\ngentlemen. We're staying on Terra.\" He guided the bewildered young man\nthrough the crowds and to the gates of the field. Outside, a number of\nsurface vehicles were lined up, with the drivers loudly competing for\nbusiness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come, take a ride in my rocket car, suited to both gent and lady,\nlined with luxury\n  <i>\n   hukka\n  </i>\n  fur brought from afar, and perfumed with rare\nscents from Algedi.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Whichever movid film you choose to view will be yours in my fine\ncab from Mizar. Just press a button\u2014it won't cost you nuttin'\u2014see\na passionate drama of long-vanished Mu or the bloodhounds pursuing\nEliza.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All honor be laid at the feet of free trade, but, whatever your race\nor your birth, each passenger curls up with two dancing girls who rides\nin the taxi from Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Couldn't we\u2014couldn't we walk? At least part of the way?\" Michael\nfaltered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carpenter stared. \"Walk! Don't you know it's forbidden to walk more\nthan two hundred yards in any one direction? Fomalhautians never walk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But they have no feet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That has nothing whatsoever to do with it.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Carpenter gently urged the young man into the Algedian cab ... which\nreeked. Michael held his nose, but his mentor shook his head. \"No, no!\nTpiu Number Five is the most esteemed aroma on Algedi. It would break\nthe driver's heart if he thought you didn't like it. You wouldn't want\nto be had up for ego injury, would you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not,\" Michael whispered weakly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Brunettes are darker and blondes are fairer,\" the advideo informed\nhim, \"when they wash out their hair with shampoos made on Chara.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a time, Michael got more or less used to Tpiu Number Five and\nwas able to take some interest in the passing landscape. Portyork,\nthe biggest spaceport in the United Universe, was, of course, the\nmost cosmopolitan city\u2014cosmopolitan in its architecture as well as\nits inhabitants. Silver domes of Earth were crowded next to the tall\nhelical edifices of the Venusians.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll notice that the current medieval revival has even reached\narchitecture,\" Carpenter pointed out. \"See those period houses in the\nFrank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very quaint,\" Michael commented.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Great floating red and green balls lit the streets, even though it was\nstill daylight, and long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whipped out\nfrom the most unlikely places. As Michael opened his mouth to inquire\nabout this, \"We now interrupt the commercials,\" the advideo said, \"to\nbring you a brand new version of one of the medieval ballads that are\nbecoming so popular....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"I shall scream,\" stated Carpenter, \"if they play\n  <i>\n   Beautiful Blue\nDeneb\n  </i>\n  just once more.... No, thank the Wise Ones, I've never heard\nthis before.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thuban, Thuban, I've been thinking,\" sang a buxom Betelgeusian, \"what\na Cosmos this could be, if land masses were transported to replace the\nwasteful sea.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess the first thing for me to do,\" Michael began in a businesslike\nmanner, \"is to get myself a room at a hotel.... What have I said now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The word\n  <i>\n   hotel\n  </i>\n  ,\" Carpenter explained through pursed lips, \"is\nnot used in polite society any more. It has come to have unpleasant\nconnotations. It means\u2014a place of dancing girls. I hardly think....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly not,\" Michael agreed austerely. \"I merely want a lodging.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That word is also\u2014well, you see,\" Carpenter told him, \"on Zaniah it\nis unthinkable to go anywhere without one's family.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're a sort of ant, aren't they? The Zaniahans, I mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"More like bees. So those creatures who travel\u2014\" Carpenter lowered his\nvoice modestly \"\u2014\n  <i>\n   alone\n  </i>\n  hire a family for the duration of their stay.\nThere are a number of families available, but the better types come\nrather high. There has been talk of reviving the old-fashioned price\ncontrols, but the Wise Ones say this would limit free enterprise as\nmuch as\u2014if you'll excuse my use of the expression\u2014tariffs would.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The taxi let them off at a square meadow which was filled with\ntransparent plastic domes housing clocks of all varieties, most of\nthe antique type based on the old twenty-four hour day instead of the\nstandard thirty hours. There were few extraterrestrial clocks because\nmost non-humans had time sense, Michael knew, and needed no mechanical\ndevices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This,\" said Carpenter, \"is Times Square. Once it wasn't really square,\nbut it is contrary to Nekkarian custom to do, say, imply, or permit\nthe existence of anything that isn't true, so when Nekkar entered the\nUnion, we had to square off the place. And, of course, install the\nclocks. Finest clock museum in the Union, I understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The pictures in my history books\u2014\" Michael began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did I hear you correctly, sir?\" The capes of a bright blue cloak\ntrembled with the indignation of a scarlet, many-tentacled being. \"Did\nyou use the word\n  <i>\n   history\n  </i>\n  ?\" He pronounced it in terms of loathing. \"I\nhave been grossly insulted and I shall be forced to report you to the\npolice, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please don't!\" Carpenter begged. \"This youth has just come from one of\nthe Brotherhoods and is not yet accustomed to the ways of our universe.\nI know that, because of the great sophistication for which your race is\nnoted, you will overlook this little gaucherie on his part.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" the red one conceded, \"let it not be said that Meropians are\nnot tolerant. But, be careful, young man,\" he warned Michael. \"There\nare other beings less sophisticated than we.

E. THIESSEN\n </h2>\n <p>\n  The city was strange, fantastic, beautiful.\n  <br/>\n  He'd never been there before, yet already he\n  <br/>\n  was a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  He lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an\nodd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One part of his mind said,\n  <i>\n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n  </i>\n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n  <i>\n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n  <i>\n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Then one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  She said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric stared. The idea was staggering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. The time has come.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My brother, Garve.

It also sets up the purpose of Eric the Bronze and whether Eric North will fulfill it or not. However, this is also significant to Garve because he shows that he loves the city and wants to stay in it, directly contradicting what Eric is supposed to do to the city. \n\n"}]}]}

And there was only\n  <br/>\n  a surface rocket in which to escape\u2014with\n  <br/>\n  a traitorous Ganymedean for its pilot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Fall 1942.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, Rat!\" Roberds said, \"what\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  say goes around here. It doesn't\nhappen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits,\nand I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will\nbe in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat,\nget this:\n  <i>\n   I'm\n  </i>\n  going to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or\nno Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because\nthis is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my\nposition, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness.\n\"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the\nwoman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look,\nwavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the\nstare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray\nalmost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job,\nblack-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated\na precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four\nnice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water\ntanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards,\nallright. I pilot ship. Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" Roberds screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the\noffice froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through\nthe narrow door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me\nthrow this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his\nchair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he\nblindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\n  <i>\n   might\n  </i>\n  be able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nurse came out of the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eight days, in\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peterson opened his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Patti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Rat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel,\nchecked the concentrated rations and grunted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Greaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip\nher, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the\nCentaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock.\nThe two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building.\nOn tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat\noutside. Grease nodded understanding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Swinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly\nas he detected it in her words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\n  <i>\n   can\n  </i>\n  you?\" she demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight.\nAnd ... well, we want\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  to pilot it! She refuses to risk\nMr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the\nroom, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray\nexplained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When?\" he whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he\ndisappeared upwards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the\ntime. He'll be back in a moment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again\ninstantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Feet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her\nhands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered \"Hold tight!\" in her\near and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away\nin a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on\nsome projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind\nreturned to her throat, and she breathed again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" she managed to get out, gaspingly. \"I wasn't expecting\nthat. I had forgotten you\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\u2014had wings,\" he finished and chuckled. \"So likewise Greaseball.\" The\npale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far\nhorizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, the bag!\" she gasped. \"I've dropped it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled again. \"Have got. You scare, I catch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without\nwarning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock.\n\"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy.\" But in spite of his warning she\ntripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to\nthe hammocks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Judith?\" she asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No talk!\" Rat insisted. \"Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape.\nYou make likewise.\" Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. \"Wrap up\ntight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!\" And he left her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey! Where are you going now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!\" His voice floated back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where has he gone?\" Judith called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we\ncrashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us\nin. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ...\nhappened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for\nfear of worrying you.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The girl did not answer then and a hushed expectancy fell over the\nship. Somewhere aft a small motor was running. Wind whistled past the\nopen lock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've caused plenty of trouble haven't I?\" she asked aloud, finally.\n\"This was certainly a fool stunt, and I'm guilty of a lot of fool\nstunts! I just didn't realize until now the\n  <i>\n   why\n  </i>\n  of that law.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't talk so much,\" the nurse admonished. \"A lot of people have found\nout the\n  <i>\n   why\n  </i>\n  of that law the hard way, just as you are doing, and\nlived to remember it. Until hospitals are built on this forlorn world,\nhumans like you who haven't been properly conditioned will have to stay\nright at home.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about these men that live and work here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They never get here until they've been through the mill first.\nAdenoids, appendix', all the extra parts they can get along without.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Judith said. \"I've certainly learned my lesson!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gray didn't answer, but from out of the darkness surrounding her came a\nsound remarkably resembling a snort.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gray?\" Judith asked fearfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that\nshook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his\narms. The burden groaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gladney!\" Nurse Gray exclaimed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I got.\" Rat confirmed. \"Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how?\" she demanded. \"What of Roberds and Peterson?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trick,\" he sniggered. \"I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in.\nVery simple.\" He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped\nbuckles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And Peterson?\" she prompted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Fan\n  </i>\n  him? I don't understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.\" Rat finished up\nand was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings\nas he padded away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago.\nCursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of\nbullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian\nsnapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped\nfor the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've been hurt!\" Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his\nfeatures. She tried to struggle up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.\" With lightning fingers he flicked\nseveral switches on the panel, turned to her. \"Hold belly. Zoom!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat unlocked the master level and shoved!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Whew!\" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too\nfamiliar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its\ncrowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\n  <i>\n   last\n  </i>\n  night ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Patti.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pretty, Patti.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have to have a drink.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat stared at her without answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heard you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\n  <i>\n   upward\n  </i>\n  , beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And now, please, just\n  <i>\n   how\n  </i>\n  do I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Existence dragged. Paradoxically, time dropped away like a cloak as\nthe sense of individual hours and minutes vanished, and into its place\ncrept a slow-torturing substitute.

Rat\nwas back in the chair.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Gladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board.

You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\u2014he on Mars.

No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before.

ROBINSON\n </p>\n <p>\n  Illustrated by EMSH\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Galaxy Science Fiction January 1952.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  <i>\n   Problem: How can you arrange marriages with\n   <br/>\n   men in one solar system, women in another\u2014and\n   <br/>\n   neither willing to leave his own world?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  I\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The beasts aren't much help, are they?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl Allen snatched a breath of air and gave another heave on the line\ntied to the raft of parampa logs bobbing in the middle of the river.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he grunted, \"they're not. They always balk at a time like this,\nwhen they can see it'll be hard work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joseph Hill wiped his plump face and coiled some of the rope's slack\naround his thick waist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Together now, Karl.\n  <i>\n   One! Two!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stood knee-deep in mud on the bank, pulling and straining on the\nrope, while some few yards distant, in the shade of a grove of trees,\ntheir tiny yllumphs nibbled grass and watched them critically, but made\nno effort to come closer.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the list.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hill puffed and wheezed and took another hitch on the rope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I've been thinking about,\" he said, worried.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They took a deep breath and hauled mightily on the raft rope. The raft\nbobbed nearer. For a moment the swift waters of the Karazoo threatened\nto tear it out of their grasp, and then it was beached, most of it\nsolidly, on the muddy bank. One end of it still lay in the gurgling,\nrushing waters, but that didn't matter. They'd be back in ten hours or\nso, long before the heavy raft could be washed free.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How much time have we got, Karl?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ground was thick with shadows, and Karl cast a critical eye at\nthem. He estimated that even with the refusal of their yllumphs to help\nbeach the raft, they still had a good two hours before the rocket put\ndown at Landing City.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two hours, maybe a little more,\" he stated hastily when Hill looked\nmore worried. \"Time enough to get to Landing City and put in for our\nnumbers on the list.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned back to the raft, untied the leather and horn saddles, and\nthrew them over the backs of their reluctant mounts. He cinched his\nsaddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hill watched him curiously. \"What are you taking the furs for? This\nisn't the trading rocket.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and\nmaybe\n  <i>\n   she'll\n  </i>\n  appreciate the coverings then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You never would have thought of it yourself,\" Hill grunted. \"Grundy\nmust have told you to do it, the old fool. If you ask me, the less\nyou give them, the less they'll come to expect. Once you spoil them,\nthey'll expect you to do all the trapping and the farming and the\nfamily-raising yourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You didn't have to sign up,\" Karl pointed out. \"You could have applied\nfor a wife from some different planet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One's probably just as good as another. They'll all have to work the\nfarms and raise families.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling\nup and headed into the thick forest.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was quiet as Karl guided his mount along the dimly marked trail\nand he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would be making\nthat night. It would be nice to have somebody new to talk to. And it\nwould be good to have somebody to help with the trapping and tanning,\nsomebody who could tend the small vegetable garden at the rear of his\nshack and mend his socks and wash his clothes and cook his meals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And it was time, he thought soberly, that he started to raise a family.\nHe was mid-twenty now, old enough to want a wife and children.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You going to raise a litter, Joe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hill started. Karl realized that he had probably been thinking of the\nsame thing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One of these days I'll need help around the sawmill,\" Hill answered\ndefensively. \"Need some kids to cut the trees, a couple more to pole\nthem down the river, some to run the mill itself and maybe one to sell\nthe lumber in Landing City. Can't do it all myself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He paused a moment, thinking over something that had just occurred to\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've been thinking of your plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe I ought to\nhave one for my wife to take care of, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl chuckled. \"I don't think she'll have the time!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They left the leafy expanse of the forest and entered the grasslands\nthat sloped toward Landing City. He could even see Landing City itself\non the horizon, a smudge of rusting, corrugated steel shacks, muddy\nstreets, and the small rocket port\u2014a scorched thirty acres or so\nfenced off with barbed wire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl looked out of the corner of his eye at Hill and felt a vague wave\nof uneasiness. Hill was a big, thick man wearing the soiled clothes and\nbristly stubble of a man who was used to living alone and who liked\nit. But once he took a wife, he would probably have to keep himself in\nclean clothes and shave every few days. It was even possible that the\nwoman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The path was getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto the\nmain path from the small side trails.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hill broke the silence first. \"I wonder what they'll be like.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl looked wise and nodded knowingly. \"They're Earthwomen, Joe.\n  <i>\n   Earth!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was easy to act as though he had some inside information, but Karl\nhad to admit to himself that he actually knew very little about it. He\nwas a Second System colonist and had never even seen an Earthwoman.\nHe had heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage\nof them, some of them must have been true. Old Grundy at the rocket\noffice, who should know about these things if anybody did, seemed\ndisturbingly lacking on definite information, though he had hinted\nbroadly enough. He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the\nstories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing\n  <i>\n   definite\n  </i>\n  to\noffer, no real facts at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some of the other colonists whom they hadn't seen for the last few\nmonths shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some of the carnival\nspirit. There was Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles\nfarther up the Karazoo; Leonard, who had the biggest farm on Midplanet;\nand then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in\nyllumphs, whose name Karl couldn't remember.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They say they're good workers,\" Hill said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl nodded. \"Pretty, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They threaded their way through the crowded and muddy streets. Landing\nCity wasn't big, compared to some of the cities on Altair, where he had\nbeen raised, but Karl was proud of it. Some day it would be as big as\nany city on any planet\u2014maybe even have a population of ten thousand\npeople or more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe,\" Karl said suddenly, \"what's supposed to make women from Earth\nbetter than women from any other world?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hill located a faint itch and frowned. \"I don't know, Karl. It's hard\nto say. They're\u2014well, sophisticated, glamorous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl absorbed this in silence. Those particular qualities were, he\nthought, rather hard to define.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The battered shack that served as rocket port office and headquarters\nfor the colonial office on Midplanet loomed up in front of them. There\nwas a crowd gathered in front of the building and they forced their way\nthrough to see what had caused it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We saw this the last time we were here,\" Hill said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" Karl agreed, \"but I want to take another look.\" He was\nanxious to glean all the information that he could.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a poster of a beautiful woman leaning toward the viewer. The\nedges of the poster were curling and the colors had faded during the\nlast six months, but the girl's smile seemed just as inviting as ever.\nShe held a long-stemmed goblet in one hand and was blowing a kiss to\nher audience with the other. Her green eyes sparkled, her smile was\nprovocative. A quoted sentence read: \"I'm from\n  <i>\n   Earth\n  </i>\n  !\" There was\nnothing more except a printed list of the different solar systems to\nwhich the colonial office was sending the women.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  She was real pretty, Karl thought. A little on the thin side, maybe,\nand the dress she was wearing would hardly be practical on Midplanet,\nbut she had a certain something. Glamour, maybe?\n </p>\n <p>\n  A loudspeaker blared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers!\nAll colonists....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a jostling for places and then they were in the rapidly\nmoving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out little\nblue slips with numbers on them, pausing every now and then to tell\nthem some entertaining bit of information about the women. He had a\ngreat imagination, nothing else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl drew the number 53 and hurried to the grassy lot beside the\nlanding field that had been decorated with bunting and huge welcome\nsigns for the new arrivals. A table was loaded with government\npamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went\nover and stuffed a few in his pockets. Other tables had been set out\nand were loaded with luncheon food, fixed by the few colonial women in\nthe community. Karl caught himself eyeing the women closely, wondering\nhow the girls from Earth would compare with them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He fingered the ticket in his pocket. What would the woman be like\nwho had drawn the companion number 53 aboard the rocket? For when it\nlanded, they would pair up by numbers. The method had its drawbacks, of\ncourse, but time was much too short to allow even a few days of getting\nacquainted. He'd have to get back to his trapping lines and he imagined\nthat Hill would have to get back to his sawmill and the others to their\nfarms. What the hell, you never knew what you were getting either way,\ntill it was too late.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sandwich, mister? Pop?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl flipped the boy a coin, picked up some food and a drink, and\nwandered over to the landing field with Hill. There were still ten\nminutes or so to go before the rocket landed, but he caught himself\nstraining his sight at the blue sky, trying to see a telltale flicker\nof exhaust flame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The field was crowded and he caught some of the buzzing conversation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... never knew one myself, but let me tell you....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... knew a fellow once who married one, never had a moment's rest\nafterward....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... no comparison with colonial women. They got culture....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... I'd give a lot to know the girl who's got number twenty-five....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's meet back here with the girls who have picked our numbers,\" Hill\nsaid. \"Maybe we could trade.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karl nodded, though privately he felt that the number system was just\nas good as depending on first impressions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a murmur from the crowd and he found his gaze riveted\noverhead. High above, in the misty blue sky, was a sudden twinkle of\nfire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached up and wiped his sweaty face with a muddy hand and brushed\naside a straggly lock of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt to try to look\nhis best.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The twinkling fire came nearer.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A Mr. Macdonald to see you, Mr. Escher.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please send him right in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was entirely superfluous, he thought, because MacDonald would come\nin whether Escher wanted him to or not.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door opened and shut with a slightly harder bang than usual and\nEscher mentally braced himself. He had a good hunch what the problem\nwas going to be and why it was being thrown in their laps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacDonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few minutes,\njust looking grim and not saying anything. Escher knew the psychology\nby heart. A short preliminary silence is always more effective in\nbrowbeating subordinates than an initial furious bluster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lit a cigarette and tried to outwait MacDonald. It wasn't\neasy\u2014MacDonald had great staying powers, which was probably why he was\nthe head of the department.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Escher gave in first. \"Okay, Mac, what's the trouble? What do we have\ntossed in our laps now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know the one\u2014colonization problem. You know that when we first\nstarted to colonize, quite a large percentage of the male population\ntook to the stars, as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers,\nthe frontier type all decided they wanted to head for other worlds, to\nget away from it all. The male of the species is far more adventuresome\nthan the female; the men left\u2014but the women didn't. At least, not in\nnearly the same large numbers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, you see the problem. The ratio of women to men here on Earth is\nnow something like five to three. If you don't know what that means,\nask any man with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband-hunting isn't\njust a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's an earnest cutthroat business\nand I'm not just using a literary phrase.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He threw a paper on Escher's desk. \"You'll find most of the statistics\nabout it in that, Claude. Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to\nwomen. Shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, that kind of thing. It's\nquite a list. You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a\nlot of which wouldn't have bothered the courts before. In fact, they\nwouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they are now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Escher shook his head blankly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Most of the girls in the past who didn't catch a husband,\" MacDonald\ncontinued, \"grew up to be the type of old maid who's dedicated to\nimproving the morals and what-not of the rest of the population. We've\ngot more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more\nsilly little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the\npokey for things like violating a woman's privacy\u2014whatever that\nmeans\u2014and she's the one who decides whether what you say or do is a\nviolation or not.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Escher looked bored. \"Not to mention the new prohibition which\nforbids the use of alcohol in everything from cough medicines to hair\ntonics. Or the cleaned up moral code that reeks\u2014if you'll pardon the\nexpression\u2014of purity. Sure, I know what you mean. And you know the\nsolution. All we have to do is get the women to colonize.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it won't be easy, and that's why it's been given to us. It's your\nbaby, Claude. Give it a lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perpetual motion machines are,\" Escher said quietly. \"And pulling\nyourself up by your boot-straps. But I get the point. Nevertheless,\nwomen just don't want to colonize. And who can blame them? Why should\nthey give up living in a luxury civilization, with as many modern\nconveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored\nplanet where they have to work their fingers to the bone and play\nfootsie with wild animals and savages who would just as soon skin them\nalive as not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you advise I do, then?\" MacDonald demanded. \"Go back to the\nBoard and tell them the problem is not solvable, that we can't think of\nanything?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Escher looked hurt. \"Did I say that? I just said it wouldn't be easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Board is giving you a blank check. Do anything you think will pay\noff. We have to stay within the letter of the law, of course, but not\nnecessarily the spirit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When do they have to have a solution?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As soon as possible. At least within the year. By that time the\nsituation will be very serious. The psychologists say that what will\nhappen then won't be good.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, by then we'll have the answer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacDonald stopped at the door. \"There's another reason why they want it\nworked out. The number of men applying to the Colonization Board for\nemigration to the colony planets is falling off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How come?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacDonald smiled. \"On the basis of statistics alone, would you want to\nemigrate from a planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When MacDonald had gone, Escher settled back in his chair and idly\ntapped his fingers on the desk-top. It was lucky that the Colonization\nBoard worked on two levels. One was the well-publicized, idealistic\nlevel where nothing was too good and every deal was 99 and 44/100 per\ncent pure. But when things got too difficult for it to handle on that\nlevel, they went to Escher and MacDonald's department. The coal mine\nlevel. Nothing was too low, so long as it worked. Of course, if it\ndidn't work, you took the lumps, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rummaged around in his drawer and found a list of the qualifications\nset up by the Board for potential colonists. He read the list slowly\nand frowned. You had to be physically fit for the rigors of space\ntravel, naturally, but some of the qualifications were obviously silly.\nYou couldn't guarantee physical perfection in the second generation,\nanyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tore the qualification list in shreds and dropped it in the disposal\nchute. That would have to be the first to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were other things that could be done immediately. For one thing,\nas it stood now, you were supposed to be financially able to colonize.\nObviously a stupid and unappealing law. That would have to go next.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left and read\nit carefully. The Board could legalize polygamy, but that was no\nsolution in the long run. Probably cause more problems than it would\nsolve. Even with women as easy to handle as they were nowadays, one was\nstill enough.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which still left him with the main problem of how to get people to\ncolonize who didn't\n  <i>\n   want\n  </i>\n  to colonize.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first point was to convince them that they wanted to. The second\npoint was that it might not matter whether they wanted to or not.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No, it shouldn't be hard to solve at all\u2014provided you held your nose,\nsilenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was\nsuch a thing as a moral code.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Phyllis Hanson put the cover over her typewriter and locked the\ncorrespondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to\nbegin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She filed into the washroom with the other girls and carefully redid\nher face. It was getting hard to disguise the worry lines, to paint\naway the faint crow's-feet around her eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She wasn't, she admitted to herself for the thousandth time, what you\nwould call beautiful. She inspected herself carefully in her compact\nmirror. In a sudden flash of honesty, she had to admit that she wasn't\neven what you would call pretty. Her face was too broad, her nose a\nfraction too long, and her hair was dull. Not homely, exactly\u2014but not\npretty, either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conversation hummed around her, most of it from the little group in the\ncorner, where the extreme few who were married sat as practically a\nrace apart. Their advice was sought, their suggestions avidly followed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Going out tonight, Phyl?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hesitated a moment, then slowly painted on the rest of her mouth.\nThe question was technically a privacy violator, but she thought she\nwould sidestep it this time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want to rinse\nout.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The black-haired girl next to her nodded sympathetically. \"Sure, Phyl,\nI know what you mean. Just like the rest of us\u2014waiting for the phone\nto ring.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Phyllis finished washing up and then left the office, carefully noting\nthe girl who was waiting for the boss. The girl was beautiful in a hard\nsort of way, a platinum blonde with an entertainer's busty figure.\nWaiting for a plump, middle-aged man like a stagestruck kid outside a\ntheatre.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At home, in her small two-room bachelor-girl apartment, she stripped\nand took a hot, sudsing shower, then stepped out and toweled herself in\nfront of a mirror. She frowned slightly. You didn't know whether you\nshould keep yourself in trim just on some off-chance, or give up and\nlet yourself go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She fixed dinner, took a moderately long time doing the dishes, and\nwent through the standard routine of getting a book and curling up on\nthe sofa. It was a good book of the boot-legged variety\u2014scientifically\nwritten with enough surplus heroes and heroines and lushly described\nlove affairs to hold anybody's interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It held hers for ten pages and then she threw the book across the room,\ngetting a savage delight at the way the pages ripped and fluttered to\nthe floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What was the use of kidding herself any longer, of trying to live\nvicariously and hoping that some day she would have a home and a\nhusband? She was thirty now; the phone hadn't rung in the last three\nyears. She might as well spend this evening as she had spent so many\nothers\u2014call up the girls for a bridge game and a little gossip, though\nheaven knew you always ended up envying the people you were gossiping\nabout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps she should have joined one of the organizations at the office\nthat did something like that seven nights out of every seven. A bridge\ngame or a benefit for some school or a talk on art. Or she could have\njoined the Lecture of the Week club, or the YWCA, or any one of the\nother government-sponsored clubs designed to fill the void in a woman's\nlife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But bridge games and benefits and lectures didn't take the place of a\nhusband and family. She was kidding herself again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She got up and retrieved the battered book, then went over to the mail\nslot. She hadn't had time to open her mail that morning; most of the\ntime it wasn't worth the effort. Advertisements for book clubs, lecture\nclubs, how to win at bridge and canasta....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her fingers sprang the metal tabs on a large envelope and she took out\nthe contents and spread it wide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She gasped. It was a large poster, about a yard square. A man was on\nit, straddling a tiny city and a small panorama of farms and forests\nat his feet. He was a handsome specimen, with wavy blond hair and blue\neyes and a curly mat on his bare chest that was just enough to be\nattractive without being apelike. He held an axe in his hands and was\neyeing her with a clearly inviting look of brazen self-confidence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the\nauthorities immediately!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bright lettering at the top of the poster shrieked: \"Come to the\nColonies, the Planets of Romance!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Whoever had mailed it should be arrested and imprisoned! Preying\non....\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and figures.\nThe need for women out on the colony planets, the percentage of men to\nwomen\u2014a startling disproportion\u2014the comfortable cities that weren't\nnearly as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced\nqualifications.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She caught herself admiring the man on the poster. Naturally, it was an\nartist's conception, but even so....\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, where\nyou had to battle disease and dirty savages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was all a dream. She had never done anything like this and she\nwouldn't think of doing it now. And had any of her friends seen the\nposter? Of course, they probably wouldn't tell her even if they had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   But the poster was a violation of privacy.

It was a beautiful thing, sheer sheen satin trimmed in gold nylon\nthread. It was the kind of gown that would make anybody who wore it\nlook beautiful. The price was high, much too high for her to pay. She\nknew she would never be able to buy it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But she didn't intend to buy it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked casually around and noted that nobody was watching her.\nThere was another woman a few counters down and a man, obviously\nembarrassed, at the lingerie counter. Nobody else was in sight. It was\na perfect time. The clerk had left to look up a difficult item that she\nhad purposely asked for and probably wouldn't be back for five minutes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Time enough, at any rate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dress was lying loose, so she didn't have to pry it off any\nhangers. She took another quick look around, then hurriedly bundled it\nup and dropped it in her shopping bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She had taken two self-assured steps away from the counter when she\nfelt a hand on her shoulder. The grip was firm and muscular and she\nknew she had lost the game. She also knew that she had to play it out\nto the end, to grasp any straw.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let go of me!\" she ordered in a frostily offended voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry, miss,\" the man said politely, \"but I think we have a short trip\nto take.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She thought for a moment of brazening it out further and then gave up.\nShe'd get a few weeks or months in the local detention building, a\nprobing into her background for the psychological reasons that prompted\nher to steal, and then she'd be out again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They couldn't do anything to her that mattered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She shrugged and followed the detective calmly. None of the shoppers\nhad looked up. None seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the detention building she thanked her good luck that she was facing\na man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies\nwho served on the bench. She even found a certain satisfaction in the\npresence of the cigar smoke and the blunt, earthy language that floated\nin from the corridor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did you steal it?\" the judge asked. He held up the dress, which,\nshe noted furiously, didn't look nearly as nice as it had under the\ndepartment store lights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't have anything to say,\" she said. \"I want to see a lawyer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She could imagine what he was thinking. Another tough one, another\nplain jane who was shoplifting for a thrill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And she probably was. You had to do\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  nowadays. You couldn't\njust sit home and chew your fingernails, or run out and listen to the\nendless boring lectures on art and culture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Name?\" he asked in a tired voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She knew the statistics he wanted. \"Ruby Johnson, 32, 145 pounds, brown\nhair and green eyes. Prints on file.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The judge leaned down and mentioned something to the bailiff, who left\nand presently came back with a ledger. The judge opened it and ran his\nfingers down one of the pages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sentence would probably be the usual, she thought\u2014six months and a\nfine, or perhaps a little more when they found out she had a record for\nshoplifting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A stranger in the courtroom in the official linens of the government\nsuddenly stepped up beside the judge and looked at the page. She could\nhear a little of what he said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... anxiety neurosis ... obvious feeling of not being wanted ...\nprobably steals to attract attention ... recommend emigration.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In view of some complicating factors, we're going to give you a\nchoice,\" the judge finally said. \"You can either go to the penitentiary\nfor ten years and pay a $10,000 fine, or you can ship out to the colony\nplanets and receive a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She thought for a minute that she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand\ndollars and ten years! It was obvious that the state was interested in\nneither the fine nor in paying her room and board for ten years. She\ncould recognize a squeeze play when she saw it, but there was nothing\nshe could do about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wouldn't call that a choice,\" she said sourly. \"I'll ship out.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  V\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suzanne was proud of the apartment. It had all the modern conveniences,\nlike the needle shower with the perfume dispenser, the built-in\nsoft-drink bar in the library, the all-communications set, and the\nelectrical massager. It was a nice, comfortable setup, an illusion of\nsecurity in an ever-changing world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She lit a cigarette and chuckled.

Later, Joe and Karl agrees to meet later to see if they want to trade the girls that has their numbers. \n\nMacDonald and Claude Escher meet to discuss matters regarding the ratios between male and female at the colonies. Currently, there are not as many females on the colonized planets. From the beginning of the colonization, there were more adventuresome males than females, they headed for the new world but most of the females stayed behind. Thus, there are five females for every three males on Earth, while the colonies have more males. Thus those girls needs to be brought from their original planet, in this case the Earth, to colonies for those males there. Another problem, states MacDonald, is the number of men applying for emigration to colonized planets have been dropping. MacDonald considers this reasonable since it seems illogical for a male to move away from a place that has more females than males. Escher then disregards the qualification for colonization and decides to focus on making the people that don\u2019t want to colonize to colonize, whether it is through convincing or forcing. \n\nPhyllis Hanson is a thirty years old woman who desires a husband. The government\u2019s supplement offering cannot replace a husband and family. Then in her mail today, she gets a poster that tells her to come to the colonies.

Ruby thinks that she will simply face a small fine along with a few weeks or months in detention and that\u2019s it. She seems to have shoplifted many times that she even knows the information that the officers want.

Karl and Joseph eventually see a crowd of people in front of the rocket port office and go to inspect what is causing the commotion. The familiar poster shows a beautiful woman from Earth being advertised on the poster. They hear an announcement and follow its instructions to assemble in a line with their numbers for the wife draft. \n\nThe story switches to MacDonald and Claude Escher. MacDonald enters Escher\u2019s office and tells Escher that the departure of men from Earth to the different colonized planets has caused the ratio of women to be much higher than men, causing various issues on Earth. Escher thinks of a plan and decides that the strict qualifications for travels and need to be financially stable need to be removed. He considers using immoral methods as a solution to convince women to colonize other planets. \n\nThe story focuses on Phyliss Hanson. Phyllis finishes her job and heads to her home. She acknowledges to herself that she is not attractive while she looks at her reflection. She grows frustrated as she is 30 and longs to have a husband but she has no prospects.

The judge then informs her that she has 2 choices for her sentence: emigrate to a colony planet or go to jail for 10 years with a hefty fine attached.

None of them have ever met an Earthwoman, but there are many stories about the pretty women. Once in Landing City, they go to the rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office on Midplanet. Karl draws the number 53 and gets a few pamphlets with helpful information. He gets a sandwich and Pop from a boy before wandering back to the main field to wait for the rocket as it arrives. The story cuts to a conversation between Claude Escher and Mr. MacDonald.

The story then cuts to Phyllis Hansen, who goes to the washroom to clean up after a day at work. She then heads home and is worried about not finding a husband. There are alternatives to spending her evenings, such as bridge, gossiping, or a similar organization to fill the void. As she goes through the mail, Phyllis receives a poster advertising for women to go to the colonies to find a husband. She is offended and believes it is a violation of privacy.

And this is a huge problem. From the beginning of the colonization, there were more adventuresome males than females, thus they headed for the new world but most of the females stayed behind. The disproportional rate in the genders that gone to colonies lead to five females for every three males on Earth, while the colonies have the opposite. Hence, those girls needs to be shipped from their original planet, in this case the Earth, to colony planets for those males there. However, not many girls are applying to go. Another problem, states MacDonald, is the number of men applying for emigration to colonized planets have been dropping. MacDonald considers this reasonable since it seems illogical for a male to move away from a place that has more females than males. Escher then disregards the qualification for colonization and decides to focus on making the people that don\u2019t want to colonize to colonize, whether it is through convincing or forcing.

By eight o'clock a wet, heavy,\nsnow-smelling breeze had begun to set in, and because the crops were\nall down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee\nand remained inside. The wind blew steadily, icily from the north. It\nwas well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship landed\nin a field near the settlement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was still time. There were some last brief moments in which the\ncolonists could act and feel as they had always done. They therefore\ngrumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had\nconvenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but\nno one went out to greet them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while a rather tall, frail-looking man came out of the ship\nand stood upon the hard ground looking toward the village. He remained\nthere, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. It was a silly\nthing to do. He was obviously not coming in, either out of pride or\njust plain orneriness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I never,\" a nice lady said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's he just\n  <i>\n   standing\n  </i>\n  there for?\" another lady said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And all of them thought: well, God knows what's in the mind of a\nsoldier, and right away many people concluded that he must be drunk.\nThe seed of peace was deeply planted in these people, in the children\nand the women, very, very deep. And because they had been taught, oh so\ncarefully, to hate war they had also been taught, quite incidentally,\nto despise soldiers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lone man kept standing in the freezing wind.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and\npathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out\nin that miserable cold to meet him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not\ntoo clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than\nRossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He\nwas about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the\nhovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man\nappeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"C'n I go now, Jim?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan turned and nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning,\nhe yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and\nput it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A\nmoment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Was he\n  <i>\n   drunk\n  </i>\n  ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of\n  <i>\n   liquor\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the\nenvelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We\nhaven't much time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As\nRossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but\ncould not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The first contact Man had ever had with an intelligent alien race\noccurred out on the perimeter in a small quiet place a long way from\nhome. Late in the year 2360\u2014the exact date remains unknown\u2014an alien\nforce attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and\nthe dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the\narmy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists,\nthirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children,\nwere missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,\neven books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were\nthe bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,\nnobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier\nfinally stumbled on something.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main\nbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be\nburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow\na whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn\nvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb\nat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The\ndetonating wire had been cut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of\nearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five\nhundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,\nweak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread\nthe news, and Man began to fall back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won\nstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of\nthe colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died\nin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those\nships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a\nsociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only\ndefense Earth had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth\nwith a bottle on his hip.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well shaven\nface, Captain Dylan perched himself upon the edge of a table and\nlistened, one long booted leg swinging idly. One by one the colonists\nwere beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great\nsuddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait,\nbetween acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those\nin the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan\ngrinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake\nit and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly\nand inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and\nimpregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set\nup automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever\nhaving lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home\nout of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But\nat least this was better than the wailing of the cities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all\nby any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an\noutcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing.\nHe stirred restlessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much\nto say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: \"Lupus,\nLupus\u2014doesn't that mean wolves or something?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very\npossible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for\ndiscussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the\nhell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of\nwomen began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their\nanger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and\nconfronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our\n  <i>\n   home\n  </i>\n  . We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been\npaying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you\nearned your keep. We demand....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped\nthat he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him\nnow and giving him that name of ancient contempt, \"soldier boy.\" The\ngloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that\nwere obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for\nthe brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Dylan wanted to go on about that, to remind them that nobody had wanted\nthe army, that the fleet had grown smaller and smaller ... but this was\nnot the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be\ncoming in right now for all he knew, and all they did was talk. He had\nrealized a long time ago that no peace-loving nation in the history\nof Earth had ever kept itself strong, and although peace was a noble\ndream, it was ended now and it was time to move.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'd better get going,\" he finally said, and there was quiet.\n\"Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of\nthis system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed\nto have you gone by then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and\nthe rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two\nstopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man\nsaid he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off\nhis planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to\ncheck the bomb, grateful for the action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the\nradio shack and began chopping at the frozen ground, following the\nwire. It was the first thing he had done with his hands in weeks, and\nit felt fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan had been called up out of a bar\u2014he and Bossio\u2014and told what had\nhappened, and in three weeks now they had cleared four colonies. This\nwould be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him.\nAfter thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk,\na man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like\nthat. It would take time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain.\nWell, that was nice. After thirty years he was a captain. For thirty\nyears he had bummed all over the west end of space, had scraped his way\nalong the outer edges of Mankind, had waited and dozed and patrolled\nand got drunk, waiting always for something to happen. There were a lot\nof ways to pass the time while you waited for something to happen, and\nhe had done them all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once he had even studied military tactics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could not help smiling at that, even now. Damn it, he'd been green.\nBut he'd been only nineteen when his father died\u2014of a hernia, of a\ncrazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked\ntoo long on a heavy planet\u2014and in those days the anti-war conditioning\nout on the Rim was not very strong. They talked a lot about guardians\nof the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down\ndoctor. And ... now he was a captain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait\nand the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days\nwas upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell\nwith it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of\nthe bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults\nwhich are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the\ncore of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point:\nit made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed\nnobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something\npleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it\nthrew him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire\nhad just been cut.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his\nhands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and\nthen, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,\nthere was no time for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he\ndid not notice the wire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with\nmore'n ten. Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.\n\"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take\nforty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no\niron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck\u2014she's all we\ncould afford.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that\nsomebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said\nquickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can.\nMaybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around\nhim and the scurrying people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\"\nBecause the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but\nhe said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or\nanother, we won't leave anybody.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had\nhappened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then\nburied it again and packed it down real nice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on\na live bomb like this, but I never....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You think one of your people did it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like\nmost government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was\nsilent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,\n\"Maybe an animal?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or\nfound it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think?\nThe wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one\nis cut too\u2014newly cut.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that\na bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that\nsomething didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the\ncenter of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then\nwalked right out again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He started away but Dylan caught his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them.\nI'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his\nhands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that\nhe'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was\nperhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How?\nTelepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there\nwould be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really\nknow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Were they small? Little animals?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable\nbrain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large\nas a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long\nbefore a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly\nshown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he\nstraightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out\nhis pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last\ntime he had fired it. He never had\u2014he never had fired a gun.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n </p>\n <p>\n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The soldier grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Dylan swung slowly to look at him. \"As far as I can figure, an alien\ncut it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rush shook his head. \"No. Ain't been no aliens near this camp, and\nno peculiar animals either. We got a planet-wide radar, and ain't no\nunidentified ships come near, not since we first landed more'n a year\nago.\" He lifted the rifle and peered through the bore. \"Uh-uh. One of\nus did it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man had been thinking. And he knew the planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Telepathy?\" asked Dylan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Might be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't see it. You people live too close, you'd notice right away if\none of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rush calmly\u2014at least outwardly calmly\u2014lit his pipe. There was a\nstrength in this man that Dylan had missed before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't know,\" he said gruffly. \"But these are aliens, mister. And until\nI know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Rossel jumped. \"My God!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan moved to quiet him. \"Look, is there any animal at all that ever\ncomes near here that's as large as a dog?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a pause, Rush answered. \"Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like\na reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we\nlanded. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky.\" He rose slowly,\nthe rifle held under his arm. \"I b'lieve we might just as well go post\nthem sentries.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to\nsay. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained\nexpression on his face, to put through that call to Three.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, \"Where you want them sentries? I got\nWalt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow.\n\"You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises,\nwithin calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five\nminutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. \"Nice day for\nhuntin',\" he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering\nhis footprints.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide\nwarm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae;\ncuriously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans\ncome. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He\nsaw that they were armed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced\nlizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been\nwatching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware\nof their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that\nnight and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But\n  <i>\n   flexibility\n  </i>\n  , he reminded himself sternly,\n  <i>\n   is the first principle of\nabsorption\n  </i>\n  , and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection\nreached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the\nhour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer\ntold him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and\nthat the attack there had probably begun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay\nquietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow,\nthanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he\nwould not have to venture out into that miserable cold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with\nuncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was\ndistinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could\ntake no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single\nbutton, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling\nof the colonists' ship.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow,\nthinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later\nthe realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three\nhad never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard\nthe signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was\nall they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered.\nThere was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He\nchecked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the\nair was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what\nhe felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said\nhopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the\nmen in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and\nhe was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what\nwould have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But\neven stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he\nrealized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then\nthat he thought of Bossio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three\nwas dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was\ngone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow.\nMore than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken,\nunalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead\u2014the one\nthing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had.\nIn all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his\nfriendship and his trust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the\npeople were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were\nbeginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him\nwith hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bossio\u2014a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no\ngrudges\u2014Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried\nto help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days\nof his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and\ndie to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four\nhours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company. Now,\nwhen it was far, far too late, they were coming to the army for help.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  But in the end, damn it, he could not hate these people. All they had\never wanted was peace, and even though they had never understood that\nthe Universe is unknowable and that you must always have big shoulders,\nstill they had always sought only for peace. If peace leads to no\nconflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to be\nlearned. So he could not hate these people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and went\ninto the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they might\nbe leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to see\nthe fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone and\ntried, for the last time, to call Bossio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It was\na very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, and\nhe was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that he\nmust be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along a\nmackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking of\neveryone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be like\nthat, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and the\ncoffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at the\nship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to see\na great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes.\nThen he understood. The clothes of forty people would change the\nweight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Some\nof the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go and\nwere still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went\nautomatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The\nelders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep\nthemselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the end, the ship took forty-six people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him\nstanding by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried\nin her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected,\nrose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went\nslipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never\nunderstood before, because he had never once been among men in great\ntrouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while\nthere was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and\nthe airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp\nburning smell\u2014she couldn't get off the ground.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "2", "uid": "65c001ad2bd242a586879ed7718cff4f", "response_text": "An army ship lands near a settlement, and people look out their windows, grumbling about its presence because they want no contact with the army.

The soldier identifies himself as Captain Dylan, explaining that he has a message from Fleet Headquarters for the person in charge. Rossel takes the envelope since they don\u2019t have anyone in charge. A young man inside the ship tosses Dylan a bottle, asks if he can leave, and tells him he\u2019ll be back that night. Rossel is appalled that the younger soldier appears drunk and throws Dylan a bottle of liquor. Dylan tells Rossel to read the message because they don\u2019t have much time and starts walking toward the settlement as the ship takes off.\n\tMan\u2019s first contact with aliens had occurred at the Lupus V Colony in 2360, which aliens destroyed. When the army came to investigate, it found 31 of the 70 colonists dead, with the rest, including women and children, missing. Buildings had burned, and all technical equipment was missing. The security bomb, one of which was planted in each colony to be detonated in such an emergency, had failed to go off\u2014the detonating wire had been dug up where it was buried 12 inches deep and cut. Because there had been 500 years of peace and people were conditioned to be anti-war, the army was small and lacked respect. So the army couldn\u2019t take the time to find out exactly what had happened but just spread the news to other colonies, most of which evacuated before they were attacked.\n\tThe message Dylan delivers is that the aliens are attacking again; this settlement needs to evacuate. A big gloomy man named Rush demands help from the army fleet, but Dylan informs him that the army is too weak to help. Dylan tells them that Lt. Bossio is warning Planet Three and returning that night to pick him up. Everyone must be gone by then. Dylan digs up the detonator wire and finds it has been cut. Rossel tells him their ship will only hold 60 of their 40 colonists and asks Dylan to take the rest on the army ship. Dylan offers to ask Bossio and then shows Rossel the cut wire.

Finally, Bob Rossel meets him and hears his message. Fleet Headquarters sent Captain Dylan to hand off the letter informing them that Lupus V had been massacred. In 2360, 31 of the 70 colonists died, while the rest were captured. All of their belongings were taken too, and that which remained was burned. After the army arrived, one soldier discovered that the detonator wire was cut. On each planet, there is a bomb placed in the center. So if any aliens were to attack, the colonists could detonate to prevent human secrets from escaping. Only this time, they couldn\u2019t, because the wire was cut. \nSince then, Captain Dylan had evacuated several cities and colonies. With his bottle of booze, Dylan informs the whole colony about the situation at hand and the need to evacuate.

Captain Dylan was there to deliver a message from Fleet Headquarters to the person in charge of the colony of about 60 people, of which Bob claimed there was no one in charge so it might as well be him. The general consensus of the colonists is that peace must be achieved at all costs, and the Fleet army was counterproductive to achieving peace. So, it was quite a stir that a Fleet soldier would show up unexpectedly to deliver a message. The spaceship left with Lieutenant Bossio at the helm, promising to pick the Captain up later.\nThe Captain\u2019s message was that aliens had attacked another colony on Lupus V, killing about half of seventy colonists with the rest missing. All colonies were required to have bombs installed in a central building that would obliterate all the people there should aliens attack them to prevent aliens from gaining any knowledge of human technology or biology. At this colony, the wire from the detonator to the bomb was cut, inexplicably.\nThe Captain quickly hustles the colony on Bob\u2019s planet to evacuate, and they ready a ship that is capable of holding 40 people. It is somber for the 60 people there because not everyone will escape. Only the children, women, and youngest men are going to be loaded. Others in the colony begin pitching in and asking the Captain how to help, like Mr. Rush, who inquires about organizing sentries to post at their perimeter. During all of this, the Captain digs up the underground wire from the detonator to the bomb of this colony and finds it has also been cut very recently and reburied.\nThere is speculation as to who cut this wire, with the Captain thinking it must have been an alien and Bob thinking it must have been a colonist. There is an aside in the story, describing the culprit which is an alien hiding underground amongst the roots of a nearby tree and commanding the alien attack remotely. The alien moves up the attack from nightfall to dusk after seeing how quickly the colonists are mobilizing to escape. \nThe Captain is unable to check in with Lieutenant Bossio, who had gone to planet Three to evacuate the colonists there.

Due to hundreds of years of anti-war conditioning, the army has had little to do and their resources have dwindled, so Dylan has spent the last thirty years of his life doing little else other than drinking, getting into trouble, and studying a little bit about military tactics. The colonists are not pleased with his arrival, and Dylan sends his fellow armyman Lieutenant Bossio to nearby Planet Three to begin the process of clearing their colony as well. A man named Rossel leads Dylan into town, where he relays the story of Lupus V and its decimation by alien attackers to a group of colonists. The aliens had killed half the population of Lupus V with a heat ray and the rest of the colonists had gone missing. Prior to the attack, a wire meant to detonate a bomb buried at the center of the colony in case of alien attack had been dug up and cut inexplicably. As a result, the army had been deployed to travel to each remaining colony to warn them. The colonists demand army protection, but Dylan informs them that the army fleet is too under-resourced and short-staffed to do anything other than warn of the attacks. As Dylan goes to investigate the state of the wire buried in this colony, he recalls joining the army back when people admired soldiers and how over time that admiration morphed into disgust because of anti-war conditioning. When he discovers the wire has also been cut, Dylan goes back to the radio shack. Rossel finds him there and they discuss how many people they can fit between the colonists' ship and the army ship. Because of insufficient space, they have to come up with a plan to fit the rest of the colonists. Meanwhile, Rossel asks about the cut wire, and he wonders if one of his people might have cut it out of spite for the government rules. Dylan wonders if it might be animals, or perhaps the aliens using telepathy. With Bossio still not answering his calls, Dylan meets with Rossel and a colonist named Rush, who provides Dylan with sentries and agrees with his theory that aliens are responsible for the cut wires. Meanwhile, an alien observes the action from a control center located underground; this is where he uses a box to schedule the attack on the village and disable the colonists' ship. When Planet Three doesn\u2019t answer, Dylan realizes Bossio must be dead. He returns to the radio shack alone, but an old woman brings him coffee and a mackinaw to keep him warm.

There are thick clouds overnight, and the morning is misty and cold. The breeze carries the smell of snow, and later in the day, the snow arrives. The planet is suitable for agriculture because the colonists have already harvested their warmer weather crops and planted their winter crops.

The two colonies maintain contact via radios, and mailships make regular runs between the settlements on the different planets.

Dylan was lured by the army\u2019s recruiting advertisements calling itself guardians of the frontier.

He salutes Rossel sloppily when they first meet and delivers an envelope with a message from Fleet Headquarters. After delivering the message, his ship leaves, and Rossel accompanies Dylan back to the village. When Dylan was 19, his father died of a hernia, and he joined the army; those were the days prior to the anti-war conditioning, and people viewed soldiers as \"guardians of the frontier.\" In the ensuing years of boozing, being imprisoned, receiving anti-army insults, and endlessly waiting for something to happen, Dylan had lost the thrill of action and had lost touch with himself. Prior to his deployment with Bossio to clear the colonies, the army had finally made him a captain; even that achievement feels empty to him. Dylan has mostly been drinking for the past thirty years thanks to the army's inaction and the fact that they were universally disrespected and hated by most colonists. However, he had also spent some of that time studying military tactics. Still, he realizes he has never fired a gun. Dylan halfheartedly engages with the colonists when he first arrives to warn them of the impending alien attack. But he slowly warms up to them as he realizes that they actually need his help, and he can offer them that help. He theorizes that the cut wire is the result of telepathic interference by the aliens as they preempt their attack. He works with Rossel to devise an evacuation plan, and Rush provides Dylan with sentries. Dylan is devastated when he learns of Bossio's death. Bossio had been his only friend. In spite of the fact that Bossio had died for people who hated him, Dylan finds he cannot hate the colonists. They simply don't understand that no conflict leads to decay. At the same time, he realizes he cannot truly help them either, so he retreats back to the radio shack.  After an old woman brings him a mackinaw and coffee, Dylan realizes he should help after all. When he sees people removing their clothes to allow more people on board, and he witnesses Rossel tearily saying goodbye to his wife, Dylan feels a human connection he had lost in those thirty years of aimlessness."}]}, {"question_text": "What is the significance of the army in the story?", "question_number": 4, "responses": [{"worker_id": "2", "uid": "65c001ad2bd242a586879ed7718cff4f", "response_text": "The army has no respect from the colonists; they don\u2019t want anything to do with it because they associate it with war.

When they see Captain Dylan standing by his ship and facing the village, they think he is ridiculous or possibly drunk. Rossel noticed that Dylan appeared like a typical soldier: not very neat and not very clean, and his salute lacked proper military precision. And when Lt. Bossio tosses Dylan a bottle of liquor, Rossel isn\u2019t surprised because of the reputation soldiers have for being drunks; in fact, Rossel is disgusted by the liquor and Bossio\u2019s drunkenness. When aliens attacked Lupus V in 2360, the army found the destruction and dead and discovered why their security bomb hadn\u2019t detonated. There was little the army could do about the alien attack because the army had become so small and weak. There had been peace for 500 years when people didn\u2019t need the army, so its equipment was old, and many of the soldiers were from the bottom of society: drinkers and gamblers. So the army is just notifying other colonies of the attack and warning them to evacuate. When the colonists learn that they have to evacuate due to the threat of an alien attack, Rossel demands that the fleet defend them, and another man named Rush asks where the army fleet is, expecting it to come to their defense. When Dylan explains there is no fleet, just a few hundred obsolete ships, he is tempted to tell them that no one wants an army until it is needed. Dylan himself has been in the army for 30 years and has never seen any action. And when Rossel realizes the colony\u2019s ship won\u2019t hold all of the colonists, he asks if any fleet ships are within radio distance that they could summon to help with their evacuation, hoping that the army is near enough to be of help.

Since the wire was cut, the bomb didn\u2019t explode, enabling the aliens to take the women and children, along with all the technology, from the planet. The purpose of the bomb was to prevent the aliens from gaining knowledge of human technology and body chemistry; presumably, aliens would be able to use this information against humans in the future. Because Dylan knows of the cut wire on Lupus V, he checks the wire for the bomb on the planet he has come to evacuate. When he discovers the wire is cut here, too, he notes that the ends are clean, so someone made the cut recently. The ground over the wire was packed down, so whoever cut it also wanted to hide that it had been tampered with. Rossel assumes one of the colonists must have cut the wire, possibly thinking it was dangerous for the colonists and just a silly government rule. After Dylan tells him about the wire being cut on Lupus V, Rossel plans to question everyone. Dylan wonders if the aliens could have cut it by telepathy of one of the colonists but rules that out because if they could control one human, they could control all of them. Dylan then wonders if an alien has done it. No one knows what the aliens look like, but for them to have intelligence, they would need a large brain, making the alien about the size of a large dog. Dylan knows all the animals on the planet had been vetted before the colony was settled. When he tells the others his suspicion, Rush says the only animal they\u2019ve seen nearby is a viggle, which is something like a monkey with four legs.

The reader learns there is an alien hiding underground nearby controlling the attack that may have been capable of cutting the wire through something like telepathy.

Dylan discovers a similar situation when he arrives at the unnamed colony of the story. When he finds the cut wire, Rossel believes it is one of the colonists lashing out against a government they do not respect. When Rush sees the wire, he agrees with Dylan that it must be some kind of telepathic alien intervention.

He gulped the pill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I need something.

At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us.

You wish to go back?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we\nstarted home.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n  <br/>\n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean you come from the future?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n  <i>\n   Ante\n  </i>\n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n  <i>\n   Post\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Instead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled\ntoward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in\nthe picture waved back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth\ndimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed\nthem briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the\nchairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture\nsurged past.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have\ncriminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work.\nWhere he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove\nreach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when\nhe get there. Put him to work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Building the groove further back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sounds like interesting work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some\nday, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the\nfakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to\nknow about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader\u2014and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took\nother carrier back here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How\ndid you do it? Can I do it, too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann\nand Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Jeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Again there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are? Look around.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Snader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff nodded. \"So what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here\u2014Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics\u2014or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Her hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed\u2014it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers\u2014though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  IV\n </p>\n <p>\n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So far.

The stranger had been listening to their conversation and was seeking someone with Jeff\u2019s credentials (color television engineer) to complete an illegal job he\u2019d been hired for. Jeff and Ann have no idea that Mr. Snader is on such a job, but entertain his quirky conversation.\n\nMr. Snader has a friendly and persuasive personality, narrowly convincing Jeff and Ann to follow him to his time travel station and take a free trip to see if they like it. The Elliots do not perceive the situation as dangerous, and continue choosing to trust him at each step. Ultimately, the Elliots are escorted six years back in time through a time travelling process that appears like stepping through a screen, but their past is nothing like they remember. It is a different place entirely, and though they are frightened, their excitement and perhaps also their complete reliance on Mr. Snader to get them back home, causes them to keep following him even though he has become mean with them. \n\nMr. Snader takes the Elliotts to an apartment house to meet Septo Kersey and Dumont Bullen, the general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine. It\u2019s revealed that Mr. Snader tricked the Elliots, and brought them to Mr. Bullen who had illegally sought Jeff\u2019s services as a color engineer to profit his own interests by creating color television that did not yet exist in their time. Jeff was furious, and totally helpless.\n\nJeff and Ann were allowed to leave, because their captors were certain that they could not actually escape them. They had no idea how to leave this timeline, and had no way of finding justice being illegally present with no work permits. When Jeff and Ann stop for lunch and try to pay with the money in their pockets (which appears as illegal tender), they are approached by an officer and find out they are in a place called Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Everyone in the interaction is deeply confused, because time travel is not understood to be possible by the public - Jeff and Ann look crazy. Both are escorted to separate jail cells in a prison.\n\nOne of Mr. Bullen's barmen, a lawyer, was sent to arrange Jeff\u2019s release, if he was willing to cooperate and go work for Mr. Bullen. The lawyer has to explain to Jeff the concept of time travelling before he can get any cooperation, and so says that time travel is entering a different dimension, not moving along a linear timeline. Things look so different to Jeff in the past because he didn\u2019t travel back a linear path to exactly the way things were when he experienced these things six years ago. The story ends during their discussion.\n"}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "9603ebadf8614b538af88a55d40103b6", "response_text": "The year is 1957. Jeff and Ann sit at a restaurant and discuss Jeff\u2019s business troubles. He is concerned that he made a bad business choice five years ago. Ann tries to reassure him that that he has plenty of time to make it all back again. Greet Snader, a foreign man with a mustache, sits nearby, and overhears their conversation. He asks if they would like to go back in time. Jeff tries to leave, but Ann insists that they listen to what he has to say. Snader hands them his card and offers them a free trial. He calls Jeff Mr. Elliot although Jeff has not given the stranger his name. This gives Jeff the slightest sense of hesitation, but Ann is eager to go with Snader.\n\nAnn and Jeff follow Snader to the station, which turns out to be a reasonably-sized home in a residential neighborhood. Inside, there are two screens hanging from the ceiling. One is labeled \u201cAnte\u201d while the other is labeled \u201cPost.\u201d Each screen shows a movie, and when Snader salutes the people that appear on one screen, the strangers wave back. Ann and Jeff are both shocked because the entire thing seems impossible. Ann and Jeff watch Snader step into one of the screens, and when they look at the other screen, he steps out. \n \nSnader tells them they are going back six years. They step into a screen and jump out a few moments later. When they walk through the same door they entered, the surroundings are different, and Jeff\u2019s car has been replaced by a limousine. Snader drives, and they do not recognize anything around them. Snader stops the car outside of a building and tells them to follow him inside. \n\nAnn and Jeff meet Mr. Bullen. He explains that he is the general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, and he needs Jeff, someone from the future, to make sure that he gets colored television before anyone else. Jeff refuses to work for him, but Bullen says that Jeff is there illegally without a permit or a file. Jeff and Ann call his bluff and leave, but Bullen reminds them to call Butterfly 9 if they get in trouble. The couple goes to a restaurant, and when Jeff tries to pay, the cashier says it\u2019s counterfeit. They find out that they\u2019re in a country called Continental Federation, and these people have never heard of the U.S. Jeff and Ann are taken to jail.

At first, they think he means a trip, but he is referring to time travel. Jeff says he wishes he could go back five years and buy the building. The man offers them time travel for free and gives Jeff his business card, identifying him as Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent for the 4-D Travel Beuro. Snader invites them to come with him and indicates they can be back in one hour. Jeff and Ann ask many questions but ultimately decide to go with Snader to see what he is about.\nHe takes them to his station, a mid-sized home in a middle-class neighborhood, and shows them a room labeled 701 with two screens, indicating that they are showing people who are time traveling right now in the fourth dimension.

They enter a room labeled \"701\" with two large screens with moving pictures; the people on these screens are explained to be time travelers in the fourth dimension. This time groove can reach as early as 600AD, with convicts from Snader's time working to build the groove further back. Snader walked into one of the screens, and Jeff and Ann saw him in the other screen shortly after. Jeff is convinced this is a visual trick and wants to be shown how it works, and hesitantly steps into one of the screens.

Ann is over her fear and feels excited, figuring that they were in the future instead of the past because of a freeway they did not recognize, but Snader doesn\u2019t confirm anything. They explore and eventually meet an older man named Septo Kersey, who has asked for Snader to retrieve Jeff to work for him, as a sort of informant in color television technology. Kersey and Bullen (another man who works for the company) threaten the couple, saying they were illegal immigrants in this particular time stream.

It doesn\u2019t look suspicious at all. Jeff notes the mountains on the horizon and the warm breeze he feels before he steps inside. Snader uses a key hanging from his necklace to unlock the door, and once inside, he leads the couple to an area that looks a lot like a doctor\u2019s waiting room.

The station is located in a mid-sized house in a middle-class neighborhood. Lights are glowing in the windows as they arrive, and outside they can hear the traffic on the boulevard a few blocks away. It is dusk, the weather is warm, and Jeff can see the mountains on the horizon. Snader unlocks the door, and they are greeted by a man at a desk in the hallway who sends them to another room. \nThis room is the station.

The street outside the house has different trees and houses than he remembered in the neighborhood with the 701 station. Telephone poles and streetlights also seem different. As the limousine pulls away from the curb, Jeff makes it a point to remember the street name, Green Thru-Way, and the block number, 800. Ann notices bars on the windows of the house.

The people in this time use different currency and have different vocabulary than the people Jeff and Ann are used to. After some time in lockup, Jeff and Ann also encounter an apartment building. On the sixth floor of this building, they meet the man who hired Snader to find Jeff.

The reality of time as a dimension is why Jeff doesn\u2019t recognize the past when he and Ann travel back. Jeff wishes he could go back in time five years and buy the building where he has been working for $2,000. It has just sold for $12,000, and now he has to leave and start his business over again. Snader\u2019s offer of time travel appeals to Jeff and Ann because Jeff believes he\u2019ll be able to buy the building. Snader\u2019s assurance that they can be back in an hour helps persuade the couple to go with him to the nearby station. When they go into the screen to travel through time and Snader drives them along a freeway that didn\u2019t exist in the present 1957 or five years earlier, Jeff is convinced that Snader has actually taken them to the future. Kersey tells them that they have traveled six years back in time before the development of chromatics (color television). Bullen wants Jeff to develop color television for his company, Continental Radioptic Combine, so that he will be first on the market with color TVs. When Jeff and Ann eat at the restaurant, and Jeff tries to pay with two one-dollar bills, the clerk calls the bills \u201cstage money\u201d and motions for a policeman to come to them.

When Bullen\u2019s lawyer arrives to get Jeff and Ann out of jail, he explains to Jeff that he did travel six years in the past but that time is a dimension rather than a stream of events. He indicates that if Jeff went back to 1865, the people there would know nothing of Lincoln or the Civil War.

One is the motivation for Jeff and Ann to be interested in the time-travel technology in the first place: if Jeff could travel back in time a few years, he could sign a lease for a building for a much cheaper price that the going rate in his own time. Snader takes advantage of this fact to slip himself into the conversation the couple is having and offer his services in time travel, the particular mechanics of which are another major role of time in this story. Snader offers a time travel service that works with a technology too complicated for him to be able to explain, but for which we see two screens in one room that have moving images on them. These screens show people passing through the timestream and work as stations along a moving path of time, kind of like a train line. Once the group travels on this \"time groove\", they notice a number of differences in the \"new\" time, the past that Snader comes from. In fact, because of the differences, even though Ann and Jeff are in the past, they think that they must be far in the future because of how different things are. One of these is the construction of a highway that was not there during their time, and the other is that nobody has heard of the United States of America. Jeff figures that nobody has heard of where he comes from because they have moved so far forward in time, when it is really because in this version of the past, the United States did not develop in the way it did in Jeff's time. Because time affects the way language develops, it is interesting that one of the major differences between the time Jeff and Ann live in compared to the time Snader is from is the way people talk. In the past (that is, Snader's time), there are a lot of phrases and nouns that do not match the same words that Jeff and Ann have for those same concepts. The word for lawyer, for instance, differs. However, the languages have enough in common for the people from the different times to communicate with one another.

When he asks Snader if he\u2019s brought them to the future instead of the past, Snader doesn\u2019t even bother to answer. At the apartment, Jeff and Ann learn that Snader was paid to bring them there, and he \u201cmockingly\u201d waves at them as he leaves now that his job is done.\n\n\n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "eb397ba002bf44ef92ddb72a2a61c457", "response_text": "The relationship between the Elliotts and Mr. Snader is one with varying levels of distrust and suspicion but also some curiosity and genuine interest. When they all meet, Jeff is suspicious of everything that Mr. Snader says and does not thing it is worth his time to listen to Snader talk. Ann is curious, though, and wants to hear Snader out. It is not clear from this first part of the story what Snader thinks of the Elliots besides his interest in them as people who might be able to benefit from what he has to offer, at least on the surface. Once they all arrive at the \"4-D Travel Beuro\", as Ann has agreed to give Snader's time travel a try, the suspicion is continued. Because Jeff is an expert in color television, he is convinced everything he is seeing is some kind of visual trick and he wants to learn how it works. Jeff lets this color his interactions with Snader, and most of what he says to him has some audible distrust. At this point, Ann is also worried, once they step into the moving picture, but her fear dissipates once they are outside of the house in a different time. During this time travel, Jeff and Ann have had a lot of questions for Snader, but he is not answering any of them, at least not directly--this adds to the mistrust felt by the Elliotts. Once Snader drops the Elliots off with Kersey, they are understandably upset when they realize they have been tricked."}]}]}

But there came\n  <br/>\n  the day when his comrades found that the worth\n  <br/>\n  of a man lies sometimes in his nuisance value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories March 1943.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The audiophone buzzed thrice\u2014one long, followed by two shorts\u2014and\nIsobar Jones pressed the stud activating its glowing scanner-disc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hummm?\" he said absent-mindedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The selenoplate glowed faintly, and the image of the Dome Commander\nappeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Report ready, Jones?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Almost,\" acknowledged Isobar gloomily. \"It prob'ly ain't right,\nthough. How anybody can be expected to get\n  <i>\n   anything\n  </i>\n  right on this\ndagnabbed hunk o' green cheese\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Send it up,\" interrupted Colonel Eagan, \"as soon as you can. Sparks is\nmaking Terra contact now. That is all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That ain't all!\" declared Isobar indignantly. \"How about my bag\u2014?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It\n  <i>\n   was all\n  </i>\n  , so far as the D.C. was concerned. Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\n  <i>\n   Cond. of\nObs.\n  </i>\n  He noted the proper figures under the headings\n  <i>\n   Sun Spots\n  </i>\n  :\n  <i>\n   Max\nFreq.\n  </i>\n  \u2014\n  <i>\n   Min. Freq.\n  </i>\n  ; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Weather forecast for Terra\n  </i>\n  ,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n  <i>\n   You\n  </i>\n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  If home is where the heart is, Horatio Jones\u2014known better as \"Isobar\"\nto his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna\u2014was a long, long\nway from home. His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\n  <i>\n   impervite\n  </i>\n  hemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Excitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O.Q. But just bring\n  <i>\n   it\n  </i>\n  . Nothing else.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar bridled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\n  <i>\n   my\n  </i>\n  cubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling\nquick today. Big doings up here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah? What?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, it's Roberts and Brown\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about 'em?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe\nyou wouldn't mind if I\u2014well\u2014er\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's\nopen, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, it's\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  ? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder,\noyster-puss; here's the weather report.\" He read it. \"'\n  <i>\n   Weather\nforecast for Terra, week of May 15-21\n  </i>\n  \u2014'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ask him,\" whispered Isobar eagerly. \"Sparks, don't forget to ask him!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Riley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report,\nentered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and\ndictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That is all,\" he concluded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O.Q.,\" verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded\nRiley's shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked\nstartled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How's that? I didn't say a word\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope! I wasn't talking to you.\nI'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me\na favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a\nwindow?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What? Why\u2014why, yes, but\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Without buts,\" said Sparks grumpily. \"Yours not to reason why; yours\nbut to do or don't. Will you do it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, sure. But I don't understand\u2014\" The silver platter which had\nmirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the\ninconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun\nbriefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly\nlandscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green\ntrees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ...\npeople....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Enough?\" asked Sparks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he\nnodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other\nradioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \"\n  <i>\n   He twisted\n  </i>\n  the mike; not me. But\u2014how come\nyou always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open,\nJonesy? Homesick?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six\nmonths at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only\nmake you feel worse to see Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's\u2014well, it's\nthe things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and\ntrees.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've got\n  <i>\n   them\n  </i>\n  right here on Luna. Go look out the tower window,\nJonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest,\ngreenest little valley you ever saw.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse. All\nthat pretty, soft, green stuff Outside\u2014and we ain't allowed to go out\nin it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I thought. And what did you plan to do there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar said stubbornly, \"Well, I sort of figured I'd amuse myself for a\nwhile\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought that, too. And with\n  <i>\n   what\n  </i>\n  , pray, Jones?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Commander Eagan said, \"You'd better find some new way of amusing\nyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar said, \"I seen it. But if you think\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It says,\" stated Eagan deliberately, \"'\n  <i>\n   In order that work or rest\nperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered\nthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must\nbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander\n  </i>\n  ,' That\nmeans you, Jones!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to\nplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good\nmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning\nsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans of\nyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entire\nstructure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He suddenly seemed to gain stature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entire\norganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\u2014\" said Isobar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.\nIf now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last\namusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother\nnobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about\nthe Grannies?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life\nfound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an\nabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar\nexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was\nan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low\nintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and\nimplacable foe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Worse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever\nyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science\nwas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of\nGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, that\nthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something\nharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be\npenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,\nby electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered\natomo-needle dispenser.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for\na 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back\ninside\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely,\n  <i>\n   no\n  </i>\n  ! I have no time\nfor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,\ngood afternoon!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play\nyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the\nawful screeching wails\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect\nfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from\nhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked\nstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent\nprofanity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust!\nOh\u2014\n  <i>\n   fiddlesticks\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot\noven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.\nLoesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man\nnodded commiseratingly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not\naltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our\npoor Isobar.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit\nhomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,\n\"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something\ndeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:\n  <i>\n   weltschmertz\n  </i>\n  . There is no accurate translation in English. It means\n'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that but\nintensified a thousandfold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame\nof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which\nthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts\nof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his\nbuttons?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass\nof despair. He may try\n  <i>\n   anything\n  </i>\n  to retrieve his lost happiness, rid\nhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying\nhunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will\nfind peace and forgetfulness.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the\n\"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he\nwas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive\nculprit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Returning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome\nCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was\nencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their\npegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace\no' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll\n  <i>\n   see\n  </i>\n  about that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the\nroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge\n  <i>\n   impervite\n  </i>\n  gates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway\nto Outside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle\nadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But\ntoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture\nout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have\nto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of\nthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding\nan aura of propriety.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the\nmeeting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wilkins looked at him bewilderedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar's eyebrows arched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean you haven't been notified?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Notified of\n  <i>\n   what\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I\nwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to\ncall the office, maybe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That\u2014er\u2014won't\nbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run\nalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a\nsharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back\nsudden-like.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\n </p>\n <p>\n  How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the shooting? That could only be\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\n  <i>\n   what\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\n  <i>\n   alone\n  </i>\n  ! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  a climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Roberts shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n  <i>\n   the pipes!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n  <i>\n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roberts moaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Stop talking!\n  </i>\n  \" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\n  <i>\n   Blow!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Haa-a-roong!\n  </i>\n  \" blew Isobar Jones.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  IV\n </p>\n <p>\n  And\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\n </p>\n <p>\n  As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\n </p>\n <p>\n  So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\n  <i>\n   like\n  </i>\n  it! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\n  <i>\n   piobaireachd\n  </i>\n  into\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\n  <i>\n   can\n  </i>\n  hear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no doubt about it; the Grannies\n  <i>\n   liked\n  </i>\n  this music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\n  <i>\n   dared\n  </i>\n  not\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\n  <i>\n   Rhoderik Dhu\n  </i>\n  and the lilting\n  <i>\n   Lassies\nO'Skye\n  </i>\n  , the mournful\n  <i>\n   Coghiegh nha Shie\n  </i>\n  whose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The Cock o' the North\n  </i>\n  , he played, and\n  <i>\n   Mironton\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Wee Flow'r o'\nDee\n  </i>\n  and\n  <i>\n   MacArthur's March\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   La Cucuracha\n  </i>\n  and\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"After you?

Once he\u2019s delivered the report, Sparks asks the Earthman to turn his microphone around. As he does so, the video changes from his face to that of Earth, beautiful trees, and green grass.

Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We finished\n  <i>\n   On An Asteroid With\nYou\n  </i>\n  , modulated into\n  <i>\n   Sweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\n  </i>\n  and finished with\n  <i>\n   Tighten Your Lips on Titan\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  We waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\n  <i>\n   Zloomph\n  </i>\n  . This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hummm, I thought.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  We played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\n  <i>\n   Rhapsody of The\nStars\n  </i>\n  . He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\n  <i>\n   Zloomph\n  </i>\n  \u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  John Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hummm, I thought again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Awhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pointed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His grunt was negative.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He smiled. \"Yes, I\n  <i>\n   like\n  </i>\n  beer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  John yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What\n  <i>\n   do\n  </i>\n  you like to do, John?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oh Lord, that plan again!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\n  <i>\n   must\n  </i>\n  be interesting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Oh, oh\n  </i>\n  , I thought.\n  <i>\n   But you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls.

They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\n  <i>\n   Zloomph\n  </i>\n  to prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools.

And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account.

During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\n </p>\n <p>\n  John became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\n  <i>\n   Zloomph\n  </i>\n  automatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Goon-Face was still cautious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see.

The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table. Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We watched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  John murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\n </p>\n <p>\n  John yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  John sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  John finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How?\" John asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fat Boy gulped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  All night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\n  <i>\n   What can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  John was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat. It isn't the reporter.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then what is it, John?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's my body. It's\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, what about your body?\nAre you sick?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His face was white with terror.\n\"No, my\u2014\n  <i>\n   my body's full of holes\n  </i>\n  .\nSuppose it's one of those holes!\nHow will I get back if it is?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rose and staggered to his\n  <i>\n   Zloomph\n  </i>\n  , clutching it as though it\nwere somehow a source of strength\nand consolation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I patted him gingerly on the arm.\n\"Now John.

They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on.

From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by!

They've waited so long\u2014.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. A thousand of us died.

Please,\nMichael.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right.

The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials\ngathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of\nwhite faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned\ntoward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the\ncries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had\nstood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping\nthrong. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for\nan answer, a salvation, a happy end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to\nthem in voices of reverence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered\nadmonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them,\nopen and green and moist, on a virgin planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing\nlike an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing,\nsucking the water from the seas.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead. For\nsome time we've known the other planets in our solar system were\nuninhabitable. Now we've been from one end of the galaxy to the other.\nAnd this is what we've found.... We were given Earth. There's no place\nelse for us. The rest of the planets in the galaxy were given to\nothers. There's no place else for them. We've all had a chance to make\nthe best of Earth. Instead we've made the worst of it. So we're here\nto stay\u2014and die.\" He handed the microphone back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The silence did not change.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President grasped Michael's arm. \"What're you saying?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A buzzing rose up from the people like that of a swarm of frightened\nbees. The sea of white faces swayed and their voices began to cry. The\ndin and motion held, long and drawn out, with a wail now and a\nfluttering beneath it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael and the woman stood above them in the center of the pale,\nhovering faces of the officials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good God,\" said the President. \"You've got to tell them what you said\nisn't true!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've been searching two thousand years for a truth,\" said Michael.\n\"A thousand of us have died finding it. I've told it. That's the way\nit's got to be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President swayed, took the microphone in his hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's been some mistake!\" he cried. \"Go back to the pumps and the\ndistilleries! Go back to the water vats and the gardens and the\nflocks! Go back! Work and wait! We'll get the full truth to you.\nEverything's going to be\n  <i>\n   all right\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obediently the mass of faces separated, as though they were being spun\naway on a whirling disk. Michael and the woman were swallowed up, like\npebbles inside a closing hand, and carried away from the great, white\nship.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  They ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Great balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lights flashed through the room and the picture died.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Michael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the\nagonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in\nclutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa.\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing\nof the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to\nquiet his trembling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There\u2014there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in\nspace. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for\nhundreds of years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time,\nthe sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man\nwas struck by one of the ground cars and\n  <i>\n   everyone\n  </i>\n  who saw it went\ninsane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no\none is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for\nso long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had\nbeen real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people\nthere'd be mass hysteria.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would\ninvolve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people\nwho left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in\nspace.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President\ngravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the\ncouncil chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing\nout; the terror in them was fading away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you\ncan't bring it back to life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic\nwars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long\ntime ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now\nyou've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around,\nslowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"None.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael and Mary were silent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  In their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n  <i>\n   give\n  </i>\n  us a choice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His face went blank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's true.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  to do. Some\u2014\n  <i>\n   real\n  </i>\n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And so this will be just for\n  <i>\n   us\n  </i>\n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Again they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, there is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Proceed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\n  <i>\n   born\n  </i>\n  and haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop!\" he said quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\n  <i>\n   Let\n  </i>\n  them be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Haltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\n  <i>\n   will\n  </i>\n  die. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mary!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stopped, whirling around.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was staring down at her feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She followed his gaze.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her hand found his.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We can\n  <i>\n   live\n  </i>\n  here, Michael!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n </p>\n <p class=\"p1\">\n  ...

After looking for two thousand years, their \"Milky Way\" expedition had failed to find an alternative, but humans were desperate because Earth was scorched and not easily liveable. The President is taken aback by the news, and his council looked at some footage from the expedition, watching ships explode and seeing dangerous atmospheres that would not sustain human life. A thousand people were grown from cultured scar tissue only to die violent deaths, so people yelled for the video to be shut off. President Davis explains that violent death is an unfamiliar thing to the contemporary humans, so he decided to lie to the public about the expedition details. Michael had promised Mary they would stay on Earth, but the government lying to the public was hard--Mary suggests that Michael can still leave, but he doesn't want to go without her, and she wants to stay on the planet she came from, even if it means a difficult life on Earth. They remember their lockets, that give them the option of a quick death in case they had gotten trapped in a dangerous situation, but they don't want to threaten to kill themselves either. Mary admits she's pregnant, which is surprising because humans in this day are cultured from scar tissue. With heavy hearts, they looked out onto the city where the large TV screens were promising the public an idyllic planet that would one day be recovered again, through a different mission, which is disheartening because their own mission had turned into a lie. They went back into the council chambers and sat again. Michael and Mary were told they'd be kept in solitary confinement to protect the public, which was ironic since Mary wanted to stay on Earth to avoid loneliness. Michael reminds the President of the lockets he and his wife have, and there is panic--what is there to do? The President demanded they hand over the lockets, but Michael and Mary stay strong and ask to be let outside of the city's protective barrier so that they can experience a natural death. The President conceded, so that he didn't have to look at them anymore, and gave them the car that they asked for. They have supplies to last a year, but don't know where to go or what to do. They get out of their car and take their shoes off to walk around, experiencing quiet for the first time in memory. To their surprise, they found three blades of grass, and run to a hill to see other patches of green in the area, some animals, and a small spring. They have hope: they can build a house, have a child, and eventually they can show the ones in the city that there is hope much closer than they realized.

After finding nothing, Michael is hesitant to report the news back to Earth and wants to stay in space. Mary, however, insists they return to Earth, so they step out of their spaceship and give the first press conference detailing their failed exploit. Michael does not hold back on the details and shocks the hopeful humans to their core. The President pulls them aside and interrogates them with his council. They share all the pictures from their adventures into the galaxy, showing yellow aliens, planets with deadly atmospheres, and horrific images of the other couples on the expedition dying. The council becomes ill at the images of their gruesome deaths, so the President shuts down the slideshow. Apparently, humans were no longer accustomed to violent deaths, as they hadn\u2019t had to see any for thousands of years. The last time such an occurrence happened, a man was struck and killed by a ground car, and all the witnesses were driven mad. The President had shut down any potential violent deaths from then on. \nThe President asks for hope from Michael and Mary, but they are unable to give him any. They send them out of the chambers to deliberate their fate. Michael and Mary discuss their options. Mary wants to stay and die on Earth, while Michael wants to escape. They decide to use their lockets which cause instant death for the wearers to force the council\u2019s hand. Mary reveals that she is pregnant, something that hasn\u2019t occurred for three thousand years due to overpopulation laws, and Michael agrees to stay on Earth. \nThey return to the chambers, and the President delivers their verdict. They are condemned to isolation until the next expedition is set out, because he fears they will reveal the truth to Earth. He sent out a broadcast earlier saying there was hope after all, as they had found a planet, but lost it, so another expedition would be sent out soon.

They run down the hill and discover baby trees, flowers, wildlife, and a small stream. The Earth is healing itself, and they had the proof.

They are the lone survivors, returning to Earth with grave news that there is no other place in the galaxy humans can move to. The remaining humans on Earth are overjoyed when they make radio contact because their life on Earth is confined to a city huddled around a water hole in a desert where their technology for distilling the salty water is the only thing keeping them alive on a planet they condemn as devoid of any other resources.\n \nMichael is hesitant to land on Earth, but Mary is determined to spend the rest of her life there now. They land and deliver a speech to a cheering crowd of white faces that are the same as those that had cheered when their mission departed two thousand years ago. Humans have technology to tissue culture new bodies and effectively become immortal. Pregnancy was outlawed 3000 years ago to control the population, and ever since then they have been regenerating their bodies. Michael announces that there are no other habitable planets.

Most disturbing is that it shows the violent deaths of many explorers - some being sucked into the gravity of foreign planets, or their ships exploding after colliding with meteors. Violent death was last witnessed on Earth hundreds of years ago, and all of the witnesses went insane. The video is shocking and disturbing. The President quickly denies the validity of the video evidence, desperately trying to avoid any hysteria by the public. Michael and Mary are told to wait outside the council chambers while their fate is decided. \nMichael thinks they should have never landed on the planet, but Mary reveals she is pregnant and wants to remain on Earth.

Michael would rather end his life than tell those remaining on Earth that their mission had failed, but Mary believes they owe it to the one thousand who had perished on the expedition to reveal the truth to them. Besides, 2,000 years away from Earth is a long time, and she misses home. A crowd eagerly welcomes them, including President Davis, and Michael soon confesses no planets exist that can support human life. He and Mary have returned to Earth to stay and die. President Davis whisks them away from the troubled crowd and brings them to the council chambers, where Michael and Mary reveal the documentary footage of their trip. They show the council hundreds of years' worth of visual evidence of all the planets they visited, all the strange creatures they encountered, and, worst of all, the explicit, violent deaths of their fellow travelers. Upon seeing these deaths, the council members insist Michael and Mary turn off the footage. They are horrified by the violent images because it has been hundreds of years since any human has died a violent death; seeing such images would drive them insane. As the President and council members discuss the couple's fate, Michael and Mary await their decision and discuss what to do next. Michael wants to go back to space, while Mary wants to stay on Earth because she has grown weary of traveling and exhausted by the process of reincarnation that has kept them both alive for 2,000 years. Mary reminds Michael of the lockets they carry--lockets that were given to them prior to departing for their journey that have the power to kill them instantly in order to avoid a painful death. Mary suggests using this locket as leverage against the council, who would grant whatever they asked in exchange for not having to witness their gruesome suicides in person.

Michael and Mary are the only two people who survived, and their return was two thousand years after they left Earth. They are married, though contemporary relationships do not involve much physical touching as compared to the twenty-first century, in a few ways. When Michael hugs Mary to comfort her, he mentions that it is a custom of the past. In their society, it is illegal to have children through sexual intercourse, so it is a surprise at the end of the story when Mary admits that she might be pregnant. They have endured a lot together on their mission in outer space, and have had to watch a lot of people die. It was very isolating to be in space, living on a ship, and this is part of their other major discussion: what to do when their mission was over. Michael had some desire to stay in space and not return to the scorched planet. However, Mary wanted to return to Earth, and the two of them wanted to stay together no matter what.

Mary wins the debate, claiming that she hasn\u2019t asked much of Michael over their 2,000-year relationship. \nAs the story continues, the reader sees how they deal with their trauma differently. Michael still wants to return to space and asks Mary if they can after presenting their findings to the President\u2019s council.

Being a mere\nprimitive, I couldn't help laughing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Danny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you\nnot to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of\ninterfering busybodies getting in the way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A\nrobot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She\nturned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the\nback of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him\u2014\n  <i>\n   stop\n  </i>\n  him! He's\nhating again! I can't stand it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Father looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it,\nSylvia.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I grinned. \"That's right\u2014I'm just a poor atavism with no control over\nmyself a-tall.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned\nwoman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her\nthe complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to\nprobe anyone without permission.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\"\nshe said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,\nSylvia\u2014poor Kevin isn't responsible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted\nout from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.\nDanny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.\nKevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\"\nA psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family\u2014that is, not\nofficially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more\nthan they could help having thumbnails.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can\nadjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father\nsuggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at\nthe cure-all?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times\nand he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the\ntime to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly\nbe allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a\nmachine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Now that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever\ngot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.\nLife was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents\nthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted\ninto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the\npopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,\nlike me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no\nphysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg\ngrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if\nyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my\nyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I\nmust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what\nwas all that emotional uproar about?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could\nanswer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she\ncalled. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food\nfloating ahead of him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my\nsense of ominousness is connected with him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother\ncaught her eye.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we\ncan't figure out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been\ntested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport\nor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or\nprepossess. He can't\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to\nkeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my\nfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,\neither.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test\nfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who\nreally seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. \"It won't work, Tim.\nI know you're trying to be kind, but\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's not saying it just to be kind,\" my mother put in. \"He means it.\nNot that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,\" she added with grim\nscrupulousness. \"Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his\nextracurricular prognostications too far.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.\nAfter all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he\nwouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather\nBureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage\nme. As Danny had said, she\n  <i>\n   knew\n  </i>\n  but she didn't really\n  <i>\n   understand\n  </i>\n  .\nNobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Breakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their\nvarious jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared\u2014he was\na traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the\ncontinent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  About all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  I didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have\ndone the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before people\nstarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with\nradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous\nmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been\nlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I\ndon't know why I say\n  <i>\n   we\n  </i>\n  \u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Exploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  On that day, I walked farther than I had intended and, by the time I\ngot back home, I found the rest of my family had returned before me.\nThey seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me\nso calm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediate\nconcerns, Kev?\" Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies?\" Tim\nshot back at her. \"He probably doesn't even know what's happened.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what did happen?\" I asked, trying not to snap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One starship got back from Alpha Centauri,\" Danny said excitedly.\n\"There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my\nenthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep\ntheir thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them.\n\"What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh-uh.\" Danny shook his head. \"And hostile. The crew of the starship\nsays they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned and\nleft, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a\npretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrial\nship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But if they're hostile,\" I said thoughtfully, \"it might mean war.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace,\nbut we'll have to prepare for war just in case.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but\nwe hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military\ntechniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back\nwith reinforcements\u2014if such were its intention\u2014in less than six\nmonths. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though\nwe had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against the\naliens' armament.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would\nbe powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits\nof telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths\nto pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the\noutcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in the\nfirst place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. I\nhad been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world in\nwhich I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survival\nto know that my own smug species could look silly against a still more\ntalented race.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't so much our defense that worries me,\" my mother muttered, \"as\nlack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualties\nand there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them.\nIt's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll\nbe too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave of\nabsence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aid\ntechniques. And you too, Kevin,\" she added, obviously a little\nsurprised herself at what she was saying. \"Probably you'd be even\nbetter at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people's\npain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  an ill wind,\" she agreed, smiling wryly, \"but don't let me\ncatch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be better\nthat there should be no war and you should remain useless?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched\ntalent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers\nusually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without\none, I was necessarily devoid of the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The\naliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation\u2014even\nthe 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern\nwas entirely different from ours\u2014and the war was on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever\nworked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers\naren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but\nI was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman\nabilities\u2014normal human abilities, rather.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gee, Mr. Faraday,\" one of the other students breathed, \"you're so\nstrong. And without 'kinesis or anything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. \"My\nname's not Mr. Faraday,\" I said. \"It's Kevin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My name's Lucy,\" she giggled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I\nstarted to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed\nwhen I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a\ntourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent\nunconcern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, quit that!\" the windee yelled. \"You're making it too tight! I'll\nbe mortified!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only\na low-grade telesensitive\u2014just a poetess\u2014so I had nothing to worry\nabout as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of\nSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she\ngot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and\nshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable\na position herself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck near\nour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started\ncarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into\na hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene\u2014I had\nnever seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter\nof fact\u2014and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the\nway. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his\ntalent for prognostication.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,\"\nshe said, \"\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  certainly can.\" And there was no kindness at all in\nthe\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  She gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. \"Go on\u2014now's your\nchance to show you're of some use in this world.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Gritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had\npretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the\nright place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's\neye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed\nface again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as\nif some super-psi had plucked them from me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like\nthat before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I\nwet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking\nso hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping\nwound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not\neven my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I\ncould hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my\npatient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,\nno wound at all\u2014just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole\nagain. Not even a scar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wha\u2014wha happened?\" he asked. \"It doesn't hurt any more!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I\nwas frightened, too\u2014too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do\nanything but stare witlessly at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Touch some of the others, quick!\" my mother commanded, pushing\nastounded attendants away from stretchers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they\nwere whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in\nthe way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and\nshutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole\nthing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have\nimagined all those horrors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them\nalmost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.\nThere was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in\nseeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it\nwould have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Timothy was right,\" my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, \"and\nI was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son\u2014\" and she said\nthe word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it\u2014\"the\ngreatest gift of all, that of healing.\" She looked at me proudly. And\nLucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt ... well, good.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"I wonder why we never thought of healing as a potential psi-power,\" my\nmother said to me later, when I was catching a snatch of rest and she\nwas lighting cigarettes and offering me cups of coffee in an attempt to\nmake up twenty-six years of indifference, perhaps dislike, all at once.\n\"The ability to heal\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  recorded in history, only we never paid much\nattention to it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Recorded?\" I asked, a little jealously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" she smiled. \"Remember the King's Evil?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I should have known without her reminding me, after all the old books I\nhad read. \"Scrofula, wasn't it? They called it that because the touch\nof certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I\nguess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's\nprobably why they originally got to be the rulers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other\ndeficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of\nthem turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive,\nand not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and\neffectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital\njust for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the\nworld and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise\nthe dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I\nwouldn't be able to do even that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but\nLucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm\nyour assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at her. \"You are?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\u2014I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with\napprehension.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can\ntell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to\nsay. But right now\u2014\" I clapped her arm\u2014\"there's a job to be done.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have\ntime to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were\nwaiting for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough\nsleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to\nshow my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit\nthoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those\npowers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know\nthat, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently\ndisfigured. In a sense, they were\u2014well, my children; I felt a warm\nglow of affection toward them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the\nhospital soon leaked out\u2014during all those years of peace, the\ngovernment had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets\u2014and\npeople used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The government pointed out that such crowds outside the building might\nattract the enemy's attention. I was the most important individual on\nEarth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The\nhuman race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And\nit was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than\nthey wanted to risk me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Plenty of people did come to see me officially\u2014the President,\ngenerals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other\nobsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I\nbegan to love everybody.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?\"\nLucy asked me one day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gave her an incredulous glance. \"You mean I shouldn't help people?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that.\nJust ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why shouldn't I be?\" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. \"Are\nyou jealous, Lucy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She lowered her eyes. \"Not only that, but the war's bound to come to\nan end, you know, and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the first part of her sentence that interested me. \"Why, do you\nmean\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to\nthem. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to\nhave the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped.

The narrator is Kevin, one of the sons: he is the only person in the family without powers, a \"psi-deficient\", so he stays at home to take care of the house. The story starts at the breakfast table, where the father teleports in, the mother probes the others' thoughts, and there is grumbling about the goings-on in the household. Timothy, the youngest brother, senses turmoil in the family but is also the most hopeful--he figures that Kevin has a gift they just haven't discovered yet, which is encouraging to Kevin. After everyone else in the family leaves for their jobs, Kevin is left to think about his situation, so he goes for a long walk. Reading is his only other real source of entertainment; he doesn't have many friends because nobody wanted to play sports with someone without telepathic abilities. He couldn't explore space because other planets weren't habitable, so he wondered what would make him stand out. The reader learns that the psi powers were latent in humans and developed with exposure to nuclear energy. When he gets home from his walk, Kevin's entire family is there, processing some news. There are two inhabited planets in Alpha Centauri, and the aliens there might be preparing for war.  Kevin partly hoped there would be war for a change of pace, and his mom figured people should start learning first-aid, including Kevin. He had a benefit over his sister because he couldn't sense others' pain in the same way. He met a girl named Lucy in his first-aid class who he liked, and she was a \"low-grade telesensitive\" so he didn't have to worry about his thoughts being read. Once the aliens attacked, things got hard as Kevin had to face the injured people bought to his care. This was especially shocking because injury was not common in his world. This was where Kevin finally found his power: touching the injured people healed them almost instantly. It turned out he was the only human with this power, which was invaluable -- a hospital was even built just for Kevin to work in, where Lucy became his assistant. All at once, he became the most important human on the planet, but the humans had to hide this from their alien adversaries. Lucy was jealous of Kevin but also worried about what would happen to Kevin when the war ended, which it eventually did four months later.

His father is telepathic and uses this ability to help him get to long-distance appointments as a traveling salesman. His middle brother, Danny, has the power of telekinesis and works as a junior partner in a moving company. Kevin's sister, Sylvia, can sense emotions in people, so she is able to tell when he purposefully intensifies his anger to make her feel uncomfortable. The youngest of the family is Timothy, who works as a weather forecaster thanks to his powerful gift of prognostication. Kevin's mother is a psychiatrist with telepathic powers that she uses to read his mind. In fact, most people in the world have some kind of telepathic powers--they can read the minds of others unprotected by mind shields. While the rest of the family treats him awkwardly and goes off to their respective jobs every day, Kevin stays at home to maintain the house. However, even this task makes him feel largely useless because most of the chores can be completed by household machines. Therefore, Kevin spends much of his time daydreaming about what life would have been like for him had he been living in 1960 instead of 2102. He feels a stronger empathy for dying plants than he does for other humans, and this has given him the reputation of callousness. Although Kevin is largely resigned to his fate as a psi-deficient in a world of people with special powers, his brother Tim insists that he has some ability; it simply hasn't been discovered yet. The rest of the family shrugs off this notion, but Kevin secretly latches onto this hope. Because of his inability to tap into the telepathically-broadcast news transmissions, Kevin's family one day alerts him that a starship has returned to Earth from Alpha Centauri, where its crew had discovered two Earth-type planets. This excites Kevin, but unfortunately, the inhabitants of these planets are hostile, and they eventually make their way to Earth to begin a war. In preparation for the war, Kevin's mother encourages him and Sylvia to learn first-aid techniques at the Psycho Center in order to be ready to help the injured. During his training, Kevin meets a girl named Lucy, who flirts with him and admires his strength. When Kevin gets his first patient, he is shocked to discover that he is able to heal the injured man with a simple touch of his hands. Having discovered his new ability, Kevin sets out to heal as many of the wounded as possible; later, he learns that he is the only psi-negative in the world with this ability.

Finding\n   <br/>\n   one worth living for is the genuine problem!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  In the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't think these are native?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Standing there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\n  <i>\n   too\n  </i>\n  old.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Make a rough estimate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens whistled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\n  <i>\n   at least\n  </i>\n  several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which ought to give\n  <i>\n   them\n  </i>\n  , thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  While the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other,\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  long ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  behind. The only reason they would need a camp would be\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but\n  <i>\n   it\n  </i>\n  has a CO\n  2\n  atmosphere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about moons?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while he saw a city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities\u2014all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Down far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Tiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Quickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing alive but robots, he thought,\n  <i>\n   robots\n  </i>\n  . He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head\u2014it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They were.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what do we do now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Can\n  </i>\n  we go down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet\u2014the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   An outpost!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Greetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve....\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everyone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then the robots sent a\n  <i>\n   picture\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its\n  <i>\n   right\n  </i>\n  side, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what\n  <i>\n   they\n  </i>\n  had said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and\n  <i>\n   think\n  </i>\n  a message?\n </p>\n <p>\n  No, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We request\u2014we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Steffens had not realized that there were so many.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n  <i>\n   interested\n  </i>\n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n  <i>\n   should\n  </i>\n  seem inhuman. But....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\n  <i>\n   feel\n  </i>\n  their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\n  <i>\n   Makers\n  </i>\n  , which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could that be\n  <i>\n   pain\n  </i>\n  in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\n  <i>\n   nothing\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n   nothing\n  </i>\n  could live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Were they immortal?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens tried to understand that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\n  <i>\n   Factory\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Factory?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Surprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"What do you\n  <i>\n   do\n  </i>\n  ?\" Steffens asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "a17f0b3f37684f009d2335d827d7951e", "response_text": "Captain Steffens and his crew, including Lieutenant Ball, are exploring the dead (uninhabited) fourth planet of the star called Tybanon in the Coal Sack Nebula.

Those that they want to serve are \"the Makers\", presumably the race of people who were on the planet before the city was scorched and destroyed in some kind of radioactive explosion.

It is possible that the robots can control human minds, but they choose not to do so. They let Steffens know that they only reached out to the humans\u2019 minds because they detected that the humans were going to leave, so they decided to communicate some information about themselves so that the humans would stay for a visit. They also indicate that they explored the humans\u2019 minds only enough to be able to contact and communicate with them.

Earth didn\u2019t have robots because imaginative robots were expressly forbidden to build. Steffens thought it was possible the robots were the brains of natives encased in metal.\nSince Steffens is under \u201cThe Mapping Command\u201d, he is supposed to go no further than examining unexplored systems, checking for life-forms and the possibilities of human colonization. His conundrum was that,  \u201cif he returned to Sirius base without investigating this robot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the other, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty.\u201d\nThe robots reach out telepathically, saying in words that they are only here to serve, and communicating a photo to the minds of the crew of a robot extending a hand for a handshake.

However, Steffens is faced with a serious dilemma when he encounters the robots. He has already technically made contact by accident since he flew so close to the surface to investigate the burnt city. Whether or not he interacted with them more or flew away, he would be in trouble with the Commissioner. Contact with races is expressly forbidden, however, he wonders if robots could really be defined as a race since they were more of an invention.

He isn't even sure if they are native beings with some kind of casing to protect their organs or even just brains from the elements, or if they are entirely robots.

In addition, since the robots communicate with the humans telepathically, their messages are persuasive, and Steffens feels a strong urge to take the robot\u2019s proffered hand. Another reason he decides to engage with the robots is that while the Law of Contact forbids making contact with life-forms, the robots are not life-forms, and Steffens could very well face a court-martial for dereliction of duty if he does not make contact with them.

Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Leave!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He turned and walked off, not looking back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What rooms?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maota.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will leave now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The clock was warm.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do you feel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about the book?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n  <i>\n   kind\n  </i>\n  of book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Poetry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man raised the gun.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon.\" He pointed to the spot\nbehind his ear where the cylinder was buried. \"I can move faster than\nyou can fire the gun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota nodded. \"I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will\nkill you anyway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suggest we negotiate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand\nand wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,\nbrown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Negotiate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not\ntwenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far\naway on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just\ndisintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer\ntoward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items\naround.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It won't break. Throw it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand\nagainst his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed\nthrough it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for\na suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle\nsoftly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but\nhis desire to hear the book was strong.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Old Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw\nimpersonal shadows down where they fought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then quite suddenly a finger or hand\u2014neither knew whose finger or\nhand\u2014touched the firing stud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Both men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   You\n  </i>\n  killed it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Maota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It would not work for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are you going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota pointed to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  complex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You tell me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man was dead.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here he buried him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The high-pitched whine started.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Neither did you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson decided he try.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Michaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\n  <i>\n   He was standing up!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the\n\"clock\" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result\nas before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You devil!\" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,\nirrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.\n\"I said you were a god. I said you were a god.\n  <i>\n   I said you were a\ngod...!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "c1c18cbd52da45c7aace6bbbc422b137", "response_text": "Stationed on the Earth base of Alpha Centaurus II, Mr. Michaelson, a tall, gaunt archeologist, explores the planet for historical artifacts.

The\nfootball-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a\nrelative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close\nenough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the\nidling drivers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was\ndragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles. Energy\nof motion was converted to heat and a few meteoric fragments fused\nthemselves to the nonmetallic tube casing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the jet room the positronic line accelerator for that particular\ndriver fouled under the intolerable overload, and the backsurge sent\nsearing heat and deadly radiation blasting through the compartment\nbefore the main circuit breakers could clack open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bellow of the alarm horn brought Barry Barr fully awake, shattering\na delightfully intimate dream of the dark haired girl he hoped to see\nagain soon in Venus Colony. As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was\nclose behind him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony,\nhung back until others had gone in first. His handsome, heavy face had\nlost its usual ruddiness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Reno surveyed the havoc. Young Ryan's body floated eerily in\nthe zero gravity, charred into instant death by the back-blast. The\nline accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter\nglasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared\nminor. They had been lucky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said\nmeaningfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two\nhours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to\norder his crew into action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite\nHind's shouted orders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to\nthe control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he\nthrew in the accelerator switch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing,\nand just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   There's metal in the field!\n  </i>\n  \" His voice was high and unsteady.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Everyone knew what that meant. The slightest trace of magnetic material\nwould distort the delicately balanced cylinder of force that contained\nand directed the Hoskins blast, making it suicidal to operate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Calmly Captain Reno voiced the thought in every mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It must be cleared. From the outside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Several of the men swore under their breaths. Interplanetary space\nwas constantly bombarded, with an intensity inverse to the prevailing\ngravitation, by something called Sigma radiation. Man had never\nencountered it until leaving Earth, and little was known of it\nexcept that short exposure killed test animals and left their bodies\nunpredictably altered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inside the ship it was safe enough, for the sleek hull was charged with\na Kendall power-shield, impervious to nearly any Sigma concentration.\nBut the shielding devices in the emergency spacesuits were small\nand had never been space-tested in a region of nearly equalized\ngravitations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man who emerged from the airlock would be flipping a coin with a\nparticularly unpleasant form of death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many pairs of eyes turned toward Robson Hind. He was jet chief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm assigned, not expendable,\" he protested hastily. \"If there were\nmore trouble later....\" His face was pasty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Assigned. That was the key word. Barry Barr felt a lump tightening\nin his stomach as the eyes shifted to him. He had some training in\nHoskins drivers. He knew alloys and power tools. And he was riding Four\nunassigned after that broken ankle had made him miss Three. He was the\nlogical man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For the safety of the ship.\" That phrase, taken from the ancient\nEarthbound code of the sea, had occurred repeatedly in the\nindoctrination manual at Training Base. He remembered it, and\nremembered further the contingent plans regarding assigned and\nunassigned personnel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment he stood indecisively, the nervous, unhumorous smile\nquirking across his angular face making him look more like an untried\nboy than a structural engineer who had fought his way up through some\nof the toughest tropical construction camps of Earth. His lean body,\nbuilt more for quick, neatly coordinated action than brute power,\nbalanced handily in the zero gravity as he ran one hand through his\nsandy hair in a gesture of uncertainty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knew that not even the captain would order him through the airlock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the members of the Five Ship Plan had been selected in part for a\nsense of responsibility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nick, will you help me button up?\" he asked with forced calmness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an instant he thought he detected a sly gleam in Hind's eyes. But\nthen the jet chief was pressing forward with the others to shake his\nhand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rebellious reluctance flared briefly in Barry's mind. Dorothy Voorhees\nhad refused to make a definite promise before blasting off in Three\u2014in\nfact he hadn't even seen her during her last few days on Earth. But\nstill he felt he had the inside track despite Hind's money and the\nbrash assurance that went with it. But if Hind only were to reach Venus\nalive\u2014\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinking\npinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tiny\nfigure crawling along the hull. His spacesuit trapped and amplified\nbreathing and heartbeats into a roaring chaos that was an invitation\nto blind panic, and all the while there was consciousness of the\ninsidiously deadly Sigma radiations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry found the debris of the meteorite, an ugly shining splotch\nagainst the dull superceramic tube, readied his power chisel, started\ncutting. Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task\nrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on\nthe events that had brought him here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigma\nfor the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield was\nperfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been\ninherently poor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But men\nhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that\nhad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been\nwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round\ntrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government\nand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled\nto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by\nspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien\nconditions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to\nwhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.\nThat one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with\ncolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the\nexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,\nhe had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus\nColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form\nwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to study\nnative Venusian materials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then it was done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Barry opened his eyes. The ship was in normal deceleration and Nick\nPodtiaguine was watching him from a nearby bunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I could eat a cow with the smallpox,\" Barry declared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick grinned. \"No doubt. You slept around the clock and more. Nice job\nof work out there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry unhitched his straps and sat up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say,\" he asked anxiously. \"What's haywire with the air?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick looked startled. \"Nothing. Everything checked out when I came off\nwatch a few minutes ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry shrugged. \"Probably just me. Guess I'll go see if I can mooch a\nhandout.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He found himself a hero. The cook was ready to turn the galley inside\nout while a radio engineer and an entomologist hovered near to wait on\nhim. But he couldn't enjoy the meal. The sensations of heat and dryness\nhe had noticed on awakening grew steadily worse. It became difficult to\nbreathe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He started to rise, and abruptly the room swirled and darkened around\nhim. Even as he sank into unconsciousness he knew the answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The suit's Kendall-shield had leaked!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Four plunged toward Venus tail first, the Hoskins jets flaring ahead.\nThe single doctor for the Colony had gone out in Two and the crewmen\ntrained in first aid could do little to relieve Barry's distress.\nFainting spells alternated with fever and delirium and an unquenchable\nthirst. His breathing became increasingly difficult.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few thousand miles out Four picked up a microbeam. A feeling of\nexultation surged through the ship as Captain Reno passed the word, for\nthe beam meant that some Earthmen were alive upon Venus. They were not\nnecessarily diving straight toward oblivion. Barry, sick as he was,\nfelt the thrill of the unknown world that lay ahead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Into a miles-thick layer of opacity Four roared, with Captain Reno\nhimself jockeying throttles to keep it balanced on its self-created\nsupport of flame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're almost in,\" a voice chanted into his headphones through\ncrackling, sizzling static. \"Easy toward spherical one-thirty. Hold it!\nLower. Lower. CUT YOUR POWER!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The heavy hull dropped sickeningly, struck with a mushy thud, settled,\nsteadied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry was weak, but with Nick Podtiaguine steadying him he was waiting\nwith the others when Captain Reno gave the last order.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Airlock open. Both doors.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Venusian air poured in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For this I left Panama?\" one of the men yelped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Enough to gag a maggot,\" another agreed with hand to nose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was like mid-summer noon in a tropical mangrove swamp, hot and\nunbearably humid and overpowering with the stench of decaying\nvegetation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Barry took one deep breath, then another. The stabbing needles in\nhis chest blunted, and the choking band around his throat loosened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outer door swung wide. He blinked, and a shift in the encompassing\nvapors gave him his first sight of a world bathed in subdued light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Four had landed in a marsh with the midships lock only a few feet above\na quagmire surface still steaming from the final rocket blast. Nearby\nthe identical hulls of Two and Three stood upright in the mud. The\nmist shifted again and beyond the swamp he could see the low, rounded\noutlines of the collapsible buildings Two and Three had carried in\ntheir cargo pits. They were set on a rock ledge rising a few feet out\nof the marsh. The Colony!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Men were tossing sections of lattice duckboard out upon the swamp,\nextending a narrow walkway toward Four's airlock, and within a few\nminutes the new arrivals were scrambling down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry paid little attention to the noisy greetings and excited talk.\nImpatiently he trotted toward the rock ledge, searching for one\nparticular figure among the men and women who waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dorothy!\" he said fervently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then his arms were around her and she was responding to his kiss.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then unexpected pain tore at his chest. Her lovely face took on an\nexpression of fright even as it wavered and grew dim. The last thing he\nsaw was Robson Hind looming beside her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the glow of an overhead tubelight he recognized the kindly, deeply\nlined features of the man bending over him. Dr. Carl Jensen, specialist\nin tropical diseases. He tried to sit up but the doctor laid a\nrestraining hand on his shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Water!\" Barry croaked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The doctor held out a glass. Then his eyes widened incredulously as his\npatient deliberately drew in a breath while drinking, sucking water\ndirectly into his lungs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doctor,\" he asked, keeping his voice low to spare his throat. \"What\nare my chances? On the level.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dr. Jensen shook his head thoughtfully. \"There's not a thing\u2014not a\ndamned solitary thing\u2014I can do. It's something new to medical science.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry lay still.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your body is undergoing certain radical changes,\" the doctor\ncontinued, \"and you know as much\u2014more about your condition than I do.\nIf a normal person who took water into his lungs that way didn't die of\na coughing spasm, congestive pneumonia would get him sure. But it seems\nto give you relief.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry scratched his neck, where a thickened, darkening patch on each\nside itched infuriatingly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are these changes?\" he asked. \"What's this?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those things seem to be\u2014\" the doctor began hesitantly. \"Damn it, I\nknow it sounds crazy but they're rudimentary gills.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry accepted the outrageous statement unemotionally. He was beyond\nshock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But there must be\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pain struck again, so intense his body twisted and arched\ninvoluntarily. Then the prick of a needle brought merciful oblivion.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry's mind was working furiously. The changes the Sigma radiations\nhad inflicted upon his body might reverse themselves spontaneously, Dr.\nJensen had mentioned during a second visit\u2014but for that to happen he\nmust remain alive. That meant easing all possible strains.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the doctor came in again Barry asked him to find Nick Podtiaguine.\nWithin a few minutes the mechanic appeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cheez, it's good to see you, Barry,\" he began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stuff it,\" the sick man interrupted. \"I want favors. Can do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick nodded vigorously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"First cut that air conditioner and get the window open.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick stared as though he were demented, but obeyed, unbolting the heavy\nplastic window panel and lifting it aside. He made a face at the damp,\nmalodorous Venusian air but to Barry it brought relief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was not enough, but it indicated he was on the right track. And he\nwas not an engineer for nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Got a pencil?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He drew only a rough sketch, for Nick was far too competent to need\ndetailed drawings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Think you can get materials?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick glanced at the sketch. \"Hell, man, for you I can get anything the\nColony has. You saved Four and everybody knows it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two days?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick looked insulted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was back in eight hours, and with him came a dozen helpers. A\npower line and water tube were run through the metal partition to the\ncorridor, connections were made, and the machine Barry had sketched was\nready.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nick flipped the switch. The thing whined shrilly. From a fanshaped\nnozzle came innumerable droplets of water, droplets of colloidal size\nthat hung in the air and only slowly coalesced into larger drops that\nfell toward the metal floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry nodded, a smile beginning to spread across his drawn features.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perfect. Now put the window back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside lay the unknown world of Venus, and an open, unguarded window\nmight invite disaster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few hours later Dr. Jensen found his patient in a normal sleep. The\nroom was warm and the air was so filled with water-mist it was almost\nliquid. Coalescing drops dripped from the walls and curving ceiling\nand furniture, from the half clad body of the sleeping man, and the\nscavenger pump made greedy gulping sounds as it removed excess water\nfrom the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The doctor shook his head as he backed out, his clothes clinging wet\nfrom the short exposure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was abnormal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But so was Barry Barr.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With breathing no longer a continuous agony Barry began to recover some\nof his strength. But for several days much of his time was spent in\nsleep and Dorothy Voorhees haunted his dreams.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whenever he closed his eyes he could see her as clearly as though\nshe were with him\u2014her face with the exotic high cheek-bones\u2014her\neyes a deep gray in fascinating contrast to her raven hair\u2014lips that\nseemed to promise more of giving than she had ever allowed herself to\nfulfil\u2014her incongruously pert, humorous little nose that was a legacy\nfrom some venturesome Irishman\u2014her slender yet firmly lithe body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a few days Dr. Jensen permitted him to have visitors. They came\nin a steady stream, the people from Four and men he had not seen since\nTraining Base days, and although none could endure his semi-liquid\natmosphere more than a few minutes at a time Barry enjoyed their visits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the person for whom he waited most anxiously did not arrive. At\neach knock Barry's heart would leap, and each time he settled back with\na sigh of disappointment. Days passed and still Dorothy did not come\nto him. He could not go to her, and stubborn pride kept him from even\ninquiring. All the while he was aware of Robson Hind's presence in the\nColony, and only weakness kept him from pacing his room like a caged\nanimal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Through his window he could see nothing but the gradual brightening\nand darkening of the enveloping fog as the slow 82-hour Venusian day\nprogressed, but from his visitors' words he learned something of\nVenusian conditions and the story of the Colony.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Number One had bumbled in on visual, the pilot depending on the smeary\nimages of infra-sight goggles. An inviting grassy plain had proved to\nbe a layer of algae floating on quicksand. Frantically the crew had\nblasted down huge balsa-like marsh trees, cutting up the trunks with\nflame guns to make crude rafts. They had performed fantastic feats of\nstrength and endurance but managed to salvage only half their equipment\nbefore the shining nose of One had vanished in the gurgling ooze.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lost in a steaming, stinking marsh teeming with alien creatures that\nslithered and crawled and swam and flew, blinded by the eternal fog,\nthe crew had proved the rightness of their choice as pioneers. For\nweeks they had floundered across the deadly terrain until at last,\nbeside a stagnant-looking slough that drained sluggishly into a warm,\nalmost tideless sea a mile away, they had discovered an outcropping of\nrock. It was the only solid ground they had encountered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One man had died, his swamp suit pierced by a poisonous thorn, but the\nothers had hand-hauled the radio beacon piece by piece and set it up\nin time to guide Two to a safe landing. Houses had been assembled, the\nsecondary power units of the spaceship put to work, and the colony had\nestablished a tenuous foothold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three had landed beside Two a few months later, bringing\nreinforcements, but the day-by-day demands of the little colony's\nstruggle for survival had so far been too pressing to permit extended\nor detailed explorations. Venus remained a planet of unsolved mysteries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The helicopter brought out in Three had made several flights which\nby radar and sound reflection had placed vague outlines on the blank\nmaps. The surface appeared to be half water, with land masses mainly\njungle-covered swamp broken by a few rocky ledges, but landings away\nfrom base had been judged too hazardous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Test borings from the ledge had located traces of oil and radioactive\nminerals, while enough Venusian plants had proven edible to provide an\nadequate though monotonous food source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Venus was the diametric opposite of lifeless Mars. Through the fog\ngigantic insects hummed and buzzed like lost airplanes, but fortunately\nthey were harmless and timid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the swamps wildly improbable life forms grew and reproduced and\nfought and died, and many of those most harmless in appearance\npossessed surprisingly venomous characteristics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The jungle had been flamed away in a huge circle around the colony to\nminimize the chances of surprise by anything that might attack, but the\nblasting was an almost continuous process. The plants of Venus grew\nwith a vigor approaching fury.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most spectacular of the Venusian creatures were the amphibious armored\nmonsters, saurian or semi-saurians with a slight resemblance to the\nbrontosauri that had once lived on Earth, massive swamp-dwellers that\nused the slough beside the colony's ledge as a highway. They were\napparently vegetarians, but thorough stupidity in tremendous bulk made\nthem dangerous. One had damaged a building by blundering against it,\nand since then the colony had remained alert, using weapons to repel\nthe beasts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The most important question\u2014that of the presence or absence of\nintelligent, civilized Venusians\u2014remained unanswered. Some of the men\nreported a disquieting feeling of being watched, particularly when near\nopen water, but others argued that any intelligent creatures would have\nestablished contact.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Barry developed definite external signs of what the Sigma radiation had\ndone to him. The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into\nmembranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and\ndark parallel lines appeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not\nstopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had\nto believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the\nweird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still\nhe was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's\nfailure to visit him did not help his mental condition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming.\nDorothy was leaning over him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you\ndo have a wife and child in Philadelphia. I know it's wrong but all\nthat seems so far away it doesn't matter any more.\" Tears glistened in\nher eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh?\" he grunted. \"Who? Me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please, Barry, don't lie. She wrote to me before Three blasted\noff\u2014oh, the most piteous letter!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child.\nI've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted. His lips thinned.\n\"I\u2014think\u2014I\u2014know\u2014who\u2014wrote\u2014that\u2014letter!\" he declared grimly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Robson wouldn't!\" she objected, shocked, but there was a note of doubt\nin her voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then she was in his arms, sobbing openly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I believe you, Barry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stayed with him for hours, and she had changed since the days\nat Training Base. Long months away from the patterned restraints of\ncivilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had\nawakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a\nwoman, as well as a toxicologist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous\nand confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger\nsimmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging\nRobson Hind's features.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but\nthis time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had\nmade Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had\ncarried him too far. Barry wondered whether it had been inefficiency or\njudiciously distributed money that had made the psychometrists overlook\nsome undesirable traits in Hind's personality in accepting him for the\nFive Ship Plan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But even with his trickery Hind had lost.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He slept, and woke with a feeling of doom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The slow Venusian twilight had ended in blackness and the overhead\ntubelight was off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat up, and apprehension gave way to burning torture in his chest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silence! He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist\nmachine that no longer hummed. Power and water supplies were both dead,\ncut off outside his room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air\nwould be dry, and he would be choking and strangling. He turned to call\nfor help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door was locked!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tugged and the knob came away in his hand. The retaining screw had\nbeen removed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He beat upon the panel, first with his fists and then with the metal\ndoorknob, but the insulation between the double alloy sheets was\nefficient soundproofing. Furiously he hurled himself upon it, only to\nbounce back with a bruised shoulder. He was trapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair\nand swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again.\nA small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under\ncontinued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning\nstrength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden\nVenusian air poured in\u2014but it was not enough!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed\nsprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused\nrustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of\napproaching unconsciousness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched\nforward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of\ncolored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth\nhabits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung\nslack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his\nlife since the moment of birth forced him to inhale.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze\nof the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the\nbrackish, silt-clouded water.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became\naware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew\ninstinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock\nthe meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from\nall other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony\nwere separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless\nvoid between Earth and Venus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened\nhis eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something\nburrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat\nworm between his fingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then dozens of them\u2014hundreds\u2014were upon him from all sides. He was\nwearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to\ncongregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his\neyelids.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in\nincreasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and\nburrowed, and blindly he began to swim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and\nkept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one\nthe worms dropped off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on\na faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier\nhere, and clearer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn\nback, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he\ncould not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of\ndirection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to\nunderwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of\nhands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and\nceased. He sank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory\nsystem completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At\nlast he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a\ngasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving\ntoward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a\nfigure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat.\nOne figure drifted limply bottomward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from\nthe group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet\nmoved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the\nEarthman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the\nsticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung\nin a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to\nineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking\nand clawing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted\nthe attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to\nthe creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Human\u2014or nearly so\u2014the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and\nwebbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more\nfor ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face\nwas coarse and savage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched\na short tube from its belt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as\nhe flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the\nwater and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something\nzipped past his head, uncomfortably close.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone.\nHe struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry stared through the reddening water.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's\nspear from the mud and raised it defensively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled\ndesperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his\nspear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the\nother was upon her from behind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender\nbody backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the\nbottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help\nsecure her arms and legs with lengths of cord.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at\nher brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the\ndead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were\nloot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic\nnecklace the girl wore but it did not break.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear.\nThe girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear\nready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His\nown lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each\nother's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the\ninside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman\narched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature\ngasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in\nits belly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other one turned too late as Barry leaped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "6", "uid": "dcbefca8556f4e9db603806b2b953d91", "response_text": "Engineer Barry Barr is one of the chosen few to ride on Number Three to Venus. His beloved Dorothy Voorhees would have been riding with him, but Barry had a piece of scaffolding drop on his ankle. Unable to make the first flight, Barry hops onto Number Four instead. \nOn the journey to Venus, a small meteor crashes into their hull at several hundreds of miles an hour. The effect is immediate: Ryan is killed in the jet room and traces of the meteor are stuck in the field. Barry wakes up when the alarm bells are sounded, and rushes to join the rest of the crew to figure out what\u2019s going on. Nick Podtaguine is steering the ship with emergency controls while Captain Reno looks on. Once the jet room stabilized, Captain Reno opens the doors to find Ryan\u2019s body and ruin. After fixing all that they could, Reno hit the accelerator, only to watch in dismay at it soared out of proportions. Captain Reno cut off the power, realizing that the meteor had left metal particles in the cylinder of force. He asks for volunteers to work outside of the ship and remove all traces of the meteor. No one volunteers at first because of how dangerous a task it is; Sigma radiation affects man in ways still unknown and incurable. After Robson Hind turns the task down, Barry volunteers. He steps outside in his spacesuit equipped to block radiation and removes them with the chisel. \nOnce he returns inside, he falls asleep and wakes a day later already feeling the effects of the radiation. His symptoms only increase: dryness, heat, and breathing difficulties. He faints upon standing and realizes that the Sigma radiation had seeped into his spacesuit. \nFour heads toward Venus while Barry suffers from an insatiable thirst.

Barry had originally been assigned to Number Three, but an ankle injury caused him to take the later ship. A meteorite strikes Number Four, and since Barry is unassigned and therefore expendable, he goes outside the ship to remove the debris in spite of the dangerous presence of Sigma radiation, which had been known to kill animals. As he is outside, he thinks about Dorothy Voorhees, a toxicologist on Number Three with whom Barry is in love. The wealthy jet chief Robson Hind is also in love with Dorothy, although Dorothy only has a shallow interest in what he has to offer. Barry's spacesuit offers minimal protection against the radiation, and when he returns, he discovers he has indeed developed a kind of sickness that causes him to struggle to breathe in the ship's air. When Number Four finally lands on Venus, Barry is surprised to discover he can breathe much easier in the thick, humid atmosphere there. As Number Four reconnects with the makeshift colony the previous ships have constructed, Barry is reunited with Dorothy briefly before passing out. Dr. Carl Jensen examines Barry and keeps him on bed rest for several days. When Barry awakens, he recruits his friend Nick to help him fashion a machine that will transfer the Venusian atmosphere into his room so that he may breathe easier. Dr. Jensen is shocked at the physical changes in Barry; over time, he grows gills and webbed feet. Finally, Dorothy visits him in his room and reveals her true love for him; she had been hesitant to do so because she had received a communication from his wife in Philadelphia revealing Barry was married with a child. This news surprises Barry since he is not married; Robson must have written the letter to drive a wedge between him and Dorothy.

He works on cutting the meteorite debris, reflecting on the growing tension between himself and Robson Hind, the jet chief, over their mutual interest in Dorothy Voorhees, the dietician and toxicologist. Barry wakes up later feeling like he doesn't have enough air, and searches for a meal. As he tries to eat, he realizes he can't breathe, and it occurs to him that his suit's Kendall-shield, which was supposed to protect him from Sigma radiation, had leaked. Nobody knew quite what would happen to Barry after exposure to Sigma radiation. His breathing got worse over time and nobody could do anything for him without a doctor. The ship successfully lands on Venus, and Barry finds that the humid atmosphere makes it easier for him to breathe. He finds Dorothy, kissing her before Robson Hind shows up, then passes out and wakes up in a doctor's office. Barry inhales the water he was handed (literally ingesting it), surprising the doctor, who doesn't know what to do for Barry. They notice gills on Barry's neck, and Barry passes out again. Barry asks Nick Podtaguine, the mechanic, for help in building a machine. It seems Barry is now known for having saved the ship, so Nick figures he can get all the materials he needs, which only took him eight hours. The machine keeps Barry's room wet while keeping the excess water off of the floor. Barry recovers some energy now that he can breathe, and dreams of Dorothy Voorhees as he rests.

Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n  <i>\n   4 June 2232\n  </i>\n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n  <i>\n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n  <i>\n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The annunciator chimed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n  <i>\n   see\n  </i>\n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door burst open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n  <i>\n   get out\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton rose. \"\n  <i>\n   No\n  </i>\n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n  <i>\n   other\n  </i>\n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Prior's words haunted him.\n  <i>\n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   What good are poets?\n  </i>\n  he asked himself savagely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reply came swiftly:\n  <i>\n   What good is anything, then?\n  </i>\n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Prior's baby.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <h2>\n  II\n </h2>\n <p>\n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Roy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n  <i>\n   Fourteen\n  </i>\n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n  <i>\n   twenty\n  </i>\n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  <i>\n   FLOOR 20\n  </i>\n  <br/>\n  <i>\n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The room was large, as rooms went nowadays\u2014thirty by twenty, with deck\nupon deck of Donnerson micro-memory-tubes racked along one wall and a\nbank of microfilm records along the other. In six weeks of life Popeek\nhad piled up an impressive collection of data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While he stood there, the computer chattered, lights flashed. New facts\npoured into the memory banks. It probably went on day and night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can I help\u2014oh, it's you, Mr. Walton,\" a white-smocked technician\nsaid. Popeek employed a small army of technicians, each one faceless\nand without personality, but always ready to serve. \"Is there anything\nI can do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm simply running a routine checkup. Mind if I use the machine?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not at all, sir. Go right ahead.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton grinned lightly and stepped forward. The technician practically\nbacked out of his presence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   No doubt I must radiate charisma\n  </i>\n  , he thought. Within the building he\nwore a sort of luminous halo, by virtue of being Director FitzMaugham's\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 and second-in-command. Outside, in the colder reality of the\ncrowded metropolis, he kept his identity and Popeek rank quietly to\nhimself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Frowning, he tried to remember the Prior boy's name. Ah ... Philip,\nwasn't it? He punched out a request for the card on Philip Prior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotronic\ncircuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnerson\ntubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a\nyellow-brown card dropped out of the slot:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   3216847AB1\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   PRIOR, Philip Hugh. Born 31 May 2232, New York General Hospital, New\nYork. First son of Prior, Lyle Martin and Prior, Ava Leonard. Wgt. at\nbirth 5lb. 3oz.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  An elaborate description of the boy in great detail followed, ending\nwith blood type, agglutinating characteristic, and gene-pattern,\ncodified. Walton skipped impatiently through that and came to the\nnotification typed in curt, impersonal green capital letters at the\nbottom of the card:\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  <i>\n   EXAMINED AT N Y EUTH CLINIC 10 JUNE 2332\n  </i>\n  <br/>\n  <i>\n   EUTHANASIA RECOMMENDED\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glanced at his watch: the time was 1026. The boy was probably still\nsomewhere in the clinic lab, waiting for the figurative axe to descend.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton had set up the schedule himself: the gas chamber delivered\nHappysleep each day at 1100 and 1500. He had about half an hour to save\nPhilip Prior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He peered covertly over his shoulder; no one was in sight. He slipped\nthe baby's card into his breast pocket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That done, he typed out a requisition for explanation of the\ngene-sorting code the clinic used. Symbols began pouring forth,\nand Walton puzzledly correlated them with the line of gibberish on\nPhillip Prior's record card. Finally he found the one he wanted:\n  <i>\n   3f2,\ntubercular-prone\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He scrapped the guide sheet he had and typed out a message to the\nmachine.\n  <i>\n   Revision of card number 3216847AB1 follows. Please alter in\nall circuits.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He proceeded to retype the child's card, omitting both the fatal symbol\n  <i>\n   3f2\n  </i>\n  and the notation recommending euthanasia from the new version.\nThe machine beeped an acknowledgement. Walton smiled. So far, so good.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, he requested the boy's file all over again. After the customary\npause, a card numbered 3216847AB1 dropped out of the slot. He read it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The deletions had been made. As far as the machine was concerned,\nPhilip Prior was a normal, healthy baby.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glanced at his watch. 1037. Still twenty-three minutes before this\nmorning's haul of unfortunates was put away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now came the real test: could he pry the baby away from the doctors\nwithout attracting too much attention to himself in the process?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Five doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main\nsection of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there,\neach in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one\nto the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its\nlocal clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a\ncertificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a\ncertificate ... and life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to\nkeep in touch with every department we have, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're\nreally getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could\ndo about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Seen my brother around?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him\nfor you, Mr. Walton?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No\u2014no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly,\nWalton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in\nthe employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and\nRoy did not care to have Fred know he was down there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Strolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump,\nsqualling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc,\ntwo blind, one congenital syph.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That only makes six,\" Walton said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet.\nSeven in one morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have any trouble with the parents?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to\nunderstand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it\nup for you if you like.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution\nchamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at\nhis desk when Walton appeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Falbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He\nwas short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact\nlenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eleven hundred, as usual.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said.\n\"To keep public opinion on our side.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that\ncomes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no\nmistake. Got that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Mistake?\n  </i>\n  But how\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one\nof the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets\nout.\"\n  <i>\n   How glibly I reel this stuff off\n  </i>\n  , Walton thought in amazement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Falbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check\neverything from now on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left\nvia a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Minutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a\ntowering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He\nremembered what FitzMaugham had said:\n  <i>\n   Once we make even one exception,\nthe whole framework crumbles.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little\ndoubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he\nhad done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling\nyou, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Put him on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had\ngiven way to wild-eyed tenseness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is it, Doctor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll\nnever guess what just happened\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\u2014well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this\nmorning. And guess\u2014I mean\u2014well, one of them shouldn't have been sent\nto me!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card\nright here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is\nfine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great\nanxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet.\nSomeone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that\nthere's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us\nin half an hour.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't say a word about this to\n  <i>\n   anyone\n  </i>\n  , not even the men in the\nexamining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents,\napologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for\nany future cases of this sort.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep\nbreath and stared bleakly at the far wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law\u2014the Equalization\nLaw\u2014Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal\nas the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators,\nor the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and\nthe Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done\nit, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position\u2014his life,\neven\u2014for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, the thing was done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to\nfinish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant\nplaces and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's\nactivities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred\nnever called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And\nWalton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this\ncall. No good at all.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <h2>\n  III\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Roy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of\nthe swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built\ncloser to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven,\nnext to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\"\nwith his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to\nFred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of\ntremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to\ntake shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What\ngoes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here\na little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't\nhave time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's\nlapel, and refused to look anywhere else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Official business!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to\nbe using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was\ncurious\u2014unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of\nyour conversation with the machine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb.\nHe managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and\nsay, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek\ncomputer outlet is confidential.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then.

He asks Walton to save his son who is to be euthanized for being tubercular. Walton turns him down, but after Prior leaves, his words swim in his head. He realizes he wants to save his baby, and so he sets off to do just that. He runs into his boss, Director FitzMaugham in the elevator and tries to lie his way through the encounter. He narrowly succeeds but is left with the feeling that Director FitzMaughan knew more than he was letting on. Walton gets off at the 20th floor and breezes past the receptionist to input Philp Porter into the computer. A series of cards come out, detailing all the baby\u2019s specifics as well as the tubercular diagnosis. He deletes the cause for euthanization and inputs the new data into the system. He comes back clear. \nHoping no one saw him, he walks down past the hall of babies and chats with the doctor, asking where his brother, another doctor, is. Evidently, his brother is running analytics, so Walton is safe for now. He speaks with the executioner, Falbrough, and tells him to double-check every baby before euthanization, due to an unfortunate incident in Europe.

The Bureau of Population Equalization is working to distribute the population more evenly, removing people from overpopulated areas and resettling them in sparsely populated areas. Roy Walton is the assistant administrator of the Bureau and makes decisions about moving groups of people.  While these decisions bother him, he tries to follow the director\u2019s maxim: to stay sane, he must think of the people as pawns, not human beings. In his office, facing three-foot mounds of paperwork, Roy can disassociate himself from the humans whose lives he is impacting.\n\tSuddenly, however, he is asked to meet with a Mr. Prior, whose two-week-old son is scheduled for euthanasia (Happysleep). He refuses to see Prior because these decisions are irrevocable, but Prior makes his way into Roy\u2019s office anyway, and Roy recognizes him as a famous poet whose work he admires.

In his own office in this ugly building, at a desk piled high with more reports than he could handle, he starts to look through them and responded to one. Because the Bureau is fairly new, procedures are also still being developed. Walton's staff lets him know someone is here to see him about a Happysleep commitment (meaning someone is going to be euthanized), and Lyle Prior bursts into the office. Walton lets him stay to have a meeting but kicks his guards out: it turns out Prior is a poet who Walton recognizes. They have a hard conversation about Lyle's son, a two-week-old who is genetically susceptible to tuberculosis and is thus sentenced to be euthanized. Lyle points out that he had tuberculosis as a child, and if he had been euthanized instead of cured, his poetry would not exist. Walton has to sit alone with this, as a huge fan of Prior's work, and thinks about the thousands who had been killed or sterilized in the six weeks his office had been open so far. Walton nervously decides he has to do something even though it would be illegal, and heads out of his office, promising himself that Prior's child is the only one he would break the law for. Walton runs into Director FitzMaugham who notices he looks preoccupied; they talk about Prior and FitzMaugham reminds Walton that if they made one exception to their rules, the entire system would fall. When Walton gets off the elevator, he worries that his destination has given away his mission, but heads into the room with the euthanasia files. After looking through Philip's files, he realizes he only has half an hour to act; he re-writes Philip's file to remove the euthanasia recommendation, but still has to retrieve the baby unnoticed. The doctors are surprised to see Walton in the clinic, especially because they'd seen the Director earlier as well. Walton asks if his younger brother, another doctor, is around, so that he can try to avoid him before continuing to the execution chamber to find Philip. Walton runs into Falbrough, the executioner, and tells him to double-check all of the files in case a mistake had been made, hoping that the updated file will take care of the issue for him. Walton returns to his office and gets a call from Falbrough who wasn't sure what to do about Philip, whose record did not have a euthanasia recommendation--Walton tells him to keep it quiet and to get the child back to his parents.

He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too\u2014too\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his\nneck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter,\ngaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a\ngrunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions\ntriumphantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There! How do you like\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always\nlanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem\nconcerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned\ninsultingly and forced a shudder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You,\" Chip told him serenely, \"have no appreciation of beauty.

But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint\nentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Salvation said soberly, \"Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I\n  <i>\n   would\n  </i>\n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of \"turning the other cheek\" to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. \"I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek.

Nice\n  <i>\n   lucentite\n  </i>\n  Dome ... good atmo ... a fine artificial grav system based on Terra\nnormal. It seemed to be a popular little fueling-stop, too, for its\ncradle-bins were laden with vessels from every planet in the System,\nand as he gained the main drag he found himself rubbing shoulders\nwith citizens of every known world. Lumbering, albino Venusians,\npetal-headed Martians, Jovian runts, greenies from far Uranus,\nEarthman\u2014all were here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quite a likely place, he thought happily, to chuck a brawl.

He wanted a good time, true;\nbut he wanted it solo. The main cabaret was too crowded; he passed\nthrough it and another equally blatant room wherein twoscore Venusians\nwere straining the structure with a native \"sing-stomp,\" and ended up\nfinally, with a sigh of relief, in a small, dimly-lighted private bar\nunfrequented by anyone save a bored and listless Martian bartender.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The chrysanthemum-pated son of the desertland roused himself as Chip\nentered, rustled his petals and piped a ready greeting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Welcoom, ssirr! Trrink, pleasse?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was more like it! Chip grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Scotch,\" he said. \"\n  <i>\n   Old Spaceman.\n  </i>\n  And let's have a new bottle, Curly.\nNone of that doctored swill.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of courrsse, ssirr!\" piped the bar-keep aggrievedly. He pushed a\nbottle across the mahogany; Chip flipped a golden credit-token back at\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell me when I've guzzled this, and I'll start work on another.\" He\ntook a deep, appreciative sniff. \"And don't let any of those dizzy\ndolls in here,\" he ordered. \"I've got a lot of back drinking to catch\nup on, and I don't want to be disturbed\u2014\n  <i>\n   Hey!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In his alarm, he almost dropped the bottle. For the door suddenly burst\nopen, and in its frame loomed a figure in Space Patrol blues. A finger\npointed in Chip's direction and a bull-o'-Bashan voice roared:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Stop!\n  </i>\n  Bartender\u2014grab that man! He's a desperate criminal, wanted on\nfour planets for murder!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Shock momentarily immobilized Chip. Not so the bartender. He was, it\nseemed, an ardent pacifist. With a bleat of panic fear he scampered\nfrom his post, his metallic stilts clattering off in the distance.\nChip's accuser moved forward from the shadows; dim light illumined his\nfeatures. And\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Johnny!\n  </i>\n  \" Chip's voice lifted in a note of jubilant surprise.\n\"Johnny Haldane\u2014you old scoundrel! Where in the void did\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  drop\nfrom?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S.S.P. man chuckled and returned Chip's greeting with a\nbone-grinding handclasp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I might ask the same of you, chum! Lord, it's been ages since we've\ncrossed 'jectory! When I saw you meandering across the Casino, you\ncould have knocked me down with a jetblast! What's new?

Plating a private cruiser!\" Haldane stared at him in astonishment,\nthen whistled. \"Sweet Sacred Stars, you must be filthy with credits to\nbe able to coat an entire ship with ekalastron!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You,\" boasted Chip, \"ain't heard nothing yet!\" And he told him how\nthey had discovered an entire mountain of the previous new element, No.\n97 in the periodic table, on frigid Titania, satellite of far Uranus.\n\"It was touch-and-go for a while,\" he admitted, \"whether we'd be the\nluckiest three guys in space\u2014or the deadest! But we passed through the\nflaming caverns like old Shadrach in the Bible\u2014remember?\u2014and here we\nare!\"\n  [1]\n </p>\n <p>\n  Haldane was exuberant. \"A mountain of ekalastron!\" he gloated.\n\"That's the greatest contribution to spaceflight since Biggs'\nvelocity-intensifier!\" It was no overstatement. \"Element No. 97 was a\nmetal so light that a man could carry in one hand enough to coat the\nentire hull of a battleship\u2014yet so adamant that a gossamer film of\nit would deflect a meteor! A metal strong enough to crush diamonds to\nash\u2014but so resilient that, when properly treated, it would rebound\nlike rubber! What are you going to do with it, Chip? Put it on the\nopen market?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Warren shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not exactly. We talked it over carefully\u2014Syd and Salvation and I\u2014and\nwe decided there are some space-rats to whom it shouldn't be made\navailable. Privateers and outlaws, you know. So we turned control of\nthe mines over to the Space Patrol at Uranus, and visiphoned the Earth\nauthorities we were bringing in one cargo\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Visiphoned!\" interrupted Haldane sharply. \"Did you say visiphoned?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why\u2014why, yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"From where?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, just before we reached the Belt. We don't have a very strong\ntransmitter, you know. Sa-a-ay, what's all the excitement, pal? Did we\ndo something that was wrong?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Haldane frowned worriedly. \"I don't know, Chip. It wasn't anything\n  <i>\n   wrong\n  </i>\n  , but what you did was damned dangerous. For if your message was\nintercepted, you may have played into the very hands of\u2014the Lorelei!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Chip stared at his friend bewilderedly for a moment. Then he grinned.\n\"Hey\u2014I must be getting slightly whacky in my old age. I stand here\nwith an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I\nthought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a\nmyth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in\nthe middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks,\nwarbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grunted. \"A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this\nalleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad\nstory.\" He started to sing. \"'\n  <i>\n   Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten\n  </i>\n  \u2014'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not funny, Chip. You've described the Lorelei exactly. That's\nhow she got her name. An incredibly beautiful woman who wantonly lures\nspace-mariners to their death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The only difference is that her 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in\nthe Belt\u2014and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising\nher vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since\nthen, no less than a dozen spacecraft\u2014freighters, liners, even one\nPatrolship\u2014have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been\nbrutally murdered, their cargos stolen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Chip shrewdly. \"How do you know about her\nif the crews have been murdered?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She has a habit of locking the controls,\" explained Haldane, \"and\nsetting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her\nhideout\u2014wherever it is\u2014for empty hulks. One of these ships was\nsalvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her\npirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He\ndescribed her. His description goes perfectly with less accurate\nglimpses seen over the visiphones of several score spacecraft!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chip said soberly, \"So it's no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I\nthought you were pulling my leg. Where do\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  come into this mess,\nthough?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ekalastron!\" grunted Johnny succinctly. \"A jackpot prize for any\ncorsair!

The only\nthing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you\ncan get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes. It was a light Syd Palmer\nwould have groaned to see\u2014for it usually presaged trouble. It was a\nbright, hard, reckless light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold your jets, Johnny!\" drawled Chip. \"Aren't you forgetting one\nthing? In a couple more hours, I can face the Lorelei and her whole\nmob\u2014and be damned to them! She can't touch the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  , because\nit's being plated right now!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By thunder, you're right! Her shells will ricochet off the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee's\n  </i>\n  hull like hail off a tin roof. Chip, are you in any hurry\nto reach Earth? I thought not. What do you say we go after the Lorelei\n  <i>\n   together\n  </i>\n  ! I'll swear you in as a Deputy Patrolman; we'll take the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a deal!\" declared Chip promptly. \"You got any idea where this\nLorelei's hangout is?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's why I'm here on Danae. I got a tip that one of the Lorelei's\nmen put in here for supplies. I hoped maybe I could single him\nout somehow, follow him when he jetted for his base, and in that\nway\u2014\n  <i>\n   Chip! Look out!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Haldane shouted and moved at the same time. His arm lashed out wildly,\nthrusting, smashing Chip to the floor in a sprawling heap. The as-yet\nunopened bottle was now violently opened; it splintered into a thousand\nshards against a wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruised and shaken, Chip lifted his head to see what had caused\nJohnny's alarm. Even as he did so, the dull gloom of the bar was\nblazoned with searing effulgence. A lancet of flame leaped from the\ndark, rearward doorway, burst in Johnny Haldane's face!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Patrolman cried once, a choking cry that died in a mewling whimper.\nHis unused pistol slipped from slackening fingers, and he sagged to\nthe floor. Again crimson lightning laced the shadows; Haldane's body\njerked, and the air was raw with the hot, sickening stench of charred\nflesh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With an instinct born of bitter years, Chip had come to his knees\nbehind the shelter of the mahogany bar. But now his own flame-pistol\nwas in his hand, and a dreadful rage was mingled with the agony in his\nheart. Reckless of results, he sprang to his feet, gun spewing livid\ndeath into the shadows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His blast found a mark. For an instant flame haloed a human face drawn\nin inhuman pain. A heavy, sultry, bestial face, already puckered with\none long, ugly scar that ran from right temple to jawbone, now newly\nscarred with the red brand of Chip's marksmanship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, before Chip could fire again, came the rasp of pounding\nfootsteps. The man turned and fled. Chip bent over his fallen friend,\nseeking, with hands that did not even feel the heat, fluttering life\nbeneath still smoldering cloth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt\u2014nothing. Johnny was dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A snarl of sheer animal rage burst from Chip's lips. Someone would pay\nfor this; pay dearly! Help was coming now. He himself would lead the\nhue-and-cry that would track a foul murderer to his lair. He spun as\nthe footsteps drew nearer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hurry!\" he cried. \"This way! Follow me\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a bound, he hurdled the bar, lingered at the door only long enough\nto let the others mark his course. For they had burst into the room,\nnow, a full score of them. Excited, hard-bitten dogs of space,\nquick-triggered and willing. Once more he cried for help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"After him! Come on! He\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then\u2014disaster struck! For a reedy voice broke from the van of the\nmob. The voice of the Martian bartender.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's him!\" he piped sibilantly. \"That's the man! He's a desperate\ncriminal, wanted on four planets for murder! The Patrolman came to\narrest him\u2014\n  <i>\n   and now he's murdered the Spacie\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  The stunning injustice of that accusation came close to costing Chip\nWarren his life. For a split second he stood motionless in the doorway,\ngaping lips forming denial. Words which were never to be uttered, for\nsuddenly a raw-boned miner wrenched a Moeller from its holster, leveled\nand fired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hot tongue of death licked hungrily at the young spaceman's cheek,\nscorched air crackled in his eardrums. Now was no time to squander\nin vain argument. Chip ducked, spun, and hurled himself through the\ndoorway. There still remained one hope. That he might catch the real\nmurderer, and in that way clear himself....\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the door led to a small, deserted vestibule, and it to an alleyway\nbehind Xu'ul's Solarest. Viewing that maze of byways and passages, Chip\nknew his hope was futile. There remained but one thing to do. Get out\nof here. But quick!\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was no hard task. The labyrinth swallowed him as it had engulfed the\nscarred killer; in a few minutes even the footsteps of his pursuers\ncould no longer be heard. And Chip worked his cautious way back to the\nspaceport, and to the bin wherein was cradled the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Syd Palmer looked up in surprise as Chip let himself in the\nelectro-lock. The chubby engineer gasped, \"Salvation, look what the cat\ndrug in! His high-flying Nibs! What's the matter, Chip? Night-life too\nmuch for you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind that now!\" panted Chip. \"Is this tin can ready to roll?\nWarm the hypos. We're lifting gravs\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Palmer said anxiously, \"Now, wait a minute! The men haven't quite\nfinished plating the hull, Chip!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't help that! We've got important business. In a very few\nminutes\u2014\n  <i>\n   Ahh!\n  </i>\n  There he goes now!\" Chip had gone to the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  the\nmoment he entered the ship; now he saw in its reflector that which he\nhad expected. The gushing orange spume of a spaceship roaring from its\ncradle. \"Hurry, Syd!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were a lot of things Syd Palmer wanted to ask. He wanted to know\n  <i>\n   who\n  </i>\n  went\n  <i>\n   where\n  </i>\n  ; he was bursting with curiosity about the \"important\nbusiness\" which had brought his pal back from town in such a rush; his\nkeen eye also had detected a needle-gun burn on Chip's coat-sleeve. But\nhe was too good a companion to waste time now on such trivia.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O.Q.,\" he snapped. \"It's your pigeon!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he disappeared. They heard his voice calling to the workmen, the\nscuff of equipment being disengaged from the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee's\n  </i>\n  hull, the\nthin, high whine of warming hypatomics. Salvation looked at Warren\nquizzically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It smells,\" he ventured gently, \"like trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is trouble,\" Chip told him. \"Plenty trouble!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In that case\u2014\" said the old man mildly\u2014\"I guess I'd better get the\nrotor stripped for action.\" He stepped to the gunnery turret, dropped\nthe fore-irons and stripped their weapon for action. \"'Be ye men of\npeace,'\" he intoned, \"'but gird firmly thy loins for righteous battle!'\nThus saith the Lord God which is Jehovah. Selah!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then came Syd's cry from the depths of the hyporoom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All set, Chip! Lift gravs!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Warren's finger found a stud. And with a gusty roar the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  rocketed into space on a pillar of flame.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Two hours later, Chip was still following the bright pinpoint of\nscarlet which marked the course of his quarry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the time that had elapsed since their take-off, he had told his\nfriends the whole story. When he told about the Lorelei, Salvation\nSmith's seamy old features screwed up in a perplexed grimace. \"A\nwoman pirate in the Belt, son? I find it hard to believe. Yet\u2014\" And\nwhen he described the death of Johnny Haldane, anger smoldered in the\nmissionary's eyes, and Syd Palmer's hands knotted into tight, white\nfists. Said Syd, \"A man with a scar, eh? Well, we'll catch him sooner\nor later. And when we do\u2014\" His tone boded no good to the man who had\nslain an old and loved friend.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As a matter of fact,\" offered Salvation, \"we've got him now. Any time\nyou say the word, Chip. We're faster than he is. We can close in on him\nin five minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" nodded Warren grimly. \"But we won't do it\u2014yet. I'm borrowing\na bit of Johnny's strategy. I've been plotting his course. As soon as\nI'm sure of his destination, we'll take care of\n  <i>\n   him\n  </i>\n  . But our first\nand most vital problem is to locate the Lorelei's hideaway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Syd said, \"That's all right with me, chum. I like a good scrap as much\nas the next guy. Better, maybe. But this isn't our concern, strictly\nspeaking. What we ought to do is report this matter to the Space\nPatrol, let them take care of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Salvation shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's where you're mistaken, Sydney. This is very much our concern.\nSo much so, in fact, that we dare not make port again until it's\ncleared up. I think you have forgotten that it is not the scar-faced\nman who is wanted for the killing of Haldane\u2014but Chip!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"B-but\u2014\" gasped Palmer\u2014\"b-but that's ridiculous! Chip and Johnny were\nold buddies. Lifelong friends!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence indicates Chip's guilt.\nTwenty men saw him standing over Johnny's dead body, with a\nflame-pistol in his hand. And the barkeep heard Johnny 'arrest' Chip\nand accuse him of murder!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chip said ruefully, \"That's right, Syd. It was only a joke, but it\nbackfired. The bartender thought Johnny meant it. He scooted out of\nthere like a bat out of Hades. I'm in it up to my neck unless we can\nbring back evidence that Scarface actually did the killing. And that\nmay not be so easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stirred restlessly. \"But we'll cross that bridge when we come to\nit. Right now our job is to keep this rat in sight. We've gone farther\nalready than I expected we would.\" He turned to the old preacher.\n\"Where do you think we're going, Padre? Out of the Belt entirely?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've been wondering that myself, son. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, but it looks to me as if we're going for the Bog. If so, you'd\nbetter keep a weather-eye peeled.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Bog!\" Chip had never penetrated the planetoids so deeply before,\nbut he knew of the Bog by hearsay. All men did. A treacherous region of\ntightly packed asteroids, a mad and whirling scramble of the gigantic\nrocks which, aeons ago, had been a planet. Few spacemen dared penetrate\nthe Bog. Of those who did dare, few returned to tell the tale. \"The\nBog! Say! I'd\n  <i>\n   better\n  </i>\n  keep a sharp lookout!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned to the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  once more, fastened an eye to its lens. And\nthen\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Syd!\" he cried. \"Salvation! Look! She\u2014she\u2014!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pressed the plunger that transferred the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  image to the\ncentral viewscreen. And as he did so, a phantom filled the area which\nshould have revealed yawning space, gay with the spangles of a myriad\nglowing orbs. The vision of an unbelievably beautiful girl, the\ngolden-crowned embodiment of a man's fondest dreaming, eyes wide with\nan indistinguishable emotion, arms stretched wide in mute appeal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And from the throats of all came simultaneous recognition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   The Lorelei!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the same moment came a plea from the enchantress of space through\na second medium. For no reason anyone could explain, the ship's\n  <i>\n   telaudio\n  </i>\n  wakened to life; over it came to their ears the actual words\nof the girl:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Help! Oh, help! Can anyone hear me? Help\n  </i>\n  \u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even though he knew this to be only a ruse, a deliberate, dastardly\ntrap set for the unwary, Chip Warren's pulse leaped in hot response to\nthat desperate plea. Even with the warning of Johnny Haldane fresh in\nhis memory, some gallantry deep within him spurred him to the aid of\nthis lovely vision. Here was a woman a man could live for, fight for,\n  <i>\n   die\n  </i>\n  for! A woman like no other in the universe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then common sense came to his rescue. He wrenched his gaze from the\ntempting shadow, cried: \"Kill that wavelength! Tune the lens on\nanother beam, Syd!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Palmer, bedazzled but obedient, spun the dial of the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  .\nDespite his vastly improved science Man had never yet succeeded in\ndevising a transparent medium through which to view the void wherein\nhe soared; the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  was a device which translated impinging\nlight-waves into a picture of that which lay outside the ship's hull.\nWhen or where electrical disturbances existed in space, its frequency\ncould be changed for greater clarity. This was what Syd now attempted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But to no avail! For it mattered not which cycle he tuned to\u2014the\nimage persisted. Still on the viewscreen that pleading figure\nbeckoned piteously. And still the cabin rang to the prayers of that\nheart-tugging voice:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Help! Oh, help! Can anyone hear me? Help\n  </i>\n  \u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gone, now, was any fascination that thrilling vision might previously\nhave held for Chip Warren. Understanding of their plight dawned coldly\nupon him, and his brow became dark with anger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   We're blanketed!\n  </i>\n  Flying blind! Salvation, radio a general alarm!\nSyd, jazz the hypos to max. Shift trajectory to fourteen-oh-three North\nand loft ... fire No. 3 jet....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had hurled himself into the bucket-shaped pilot's seat; now\nhis fingers played the controls like those of a mad organist. The\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  groaned from prow to stern, trembled like a tortured thing\nas he thrust it into a rising spiral.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a desperate chance he was taking. Increasing his speed thus, it\nwas certain he would be spotted by the man he had been following; the\nflaming jets of the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  must form a crimson arch against black\nspace visible for hundreds\u2014thousands!\u2014of miles. Nor was there any way\nof knowing what lay in the path Chip thus blindly chose. Titanic death\nmight loom on every side. But they had to fight clear of this spot of\nblindness, clear their instruments....\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then it came! A jarring concussion that smashed against the prow\nof the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  like a battering ram. Chip flew headlong out of his\nbucket to spreadeagle on the heaving iron floor. He heard, above the\ngrinding plaint of shattered steel the bellowing prayer of Salvation\nSmith:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've crashed! 'Into Thy hands, O Lord of old\u2014'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Syd's angry cry, \"Crashed, hell! He's smashed us with a\ntractor-blast!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chip stared at his companion numbly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\u2014but that's impossible! We're plated with ek! A tractor-cannon\ncouldn't hurt us\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Half-plated!\n  </i>\n  \" howled Syd savagely. \"And those damn fools started\nworking from the stern of the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  ! We're vulnerable up front,\nand that's where he got us! In a minute this can will be leaking like a\nsieve. I'll get out bulgers. Hold 'er to her course, Chip!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dove for the lockers wherein were hung the space-suits, tore them\nhastily from their hangers. Chip again spun the\n  <i>\n   perilens\n  </i>\n  vernier. No\ngood! No space ... no stars ... just a beautiful phantom crying them to\ncertain doom. By now he was aware that from a dozen sprung plates air\nwas seeping, but he fought down despair. While there remained hope, a\nman had to keep on fighting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He scrambled back into the bucket-seat, experimented with controls that\nanswered sluggishly. Salvation had sprung to the rotor-gun, was now\nangrily jerking its lanyard, lacing the void with death-dealing bursts\nthat had no mark. The old man's eyes were brands of fire, his white\nhair clung wetly to his forehead. His rage was terrible to behold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"'Yes, truly shall I destroy them!'\" he cried, \"'who loose their\nstealth upon me like a thief from the night\u2014'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then suddenly there came a second and more frightful blow. The\nstraining\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  stopped as though pole-axed by a gigantic fist.\nStopped and shuddered and screamed in metal agony. This time inertia\nflung Chip headlong, helpless, into the control racks. Brazen studs\ntook the impact of his body; crushing pain banded about his temples,\nand a red wetness ran into his eyes, blurring and blinding him, burning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an instant there flamed before him a universe of incandescent\nstars, weaving, shimmering, merging. The vision of a woman whose hair\nwas a golden glory....\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that\u2014nothing!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  From a billion miles away, from a bourne unguessable thousands of\nlight-years distant, came the faint, far whisper of a voice. Nearer and\nnearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrums\nwith booming savagery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\u2014coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situation\nin which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the\n  <i>\n   Chickadee\n  </i>\n  , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. He\nlay on the parched, rocky soil of a\u2014a something. A planetoid, perhaps.\nAnd he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all the\nplanets that circle the Sun....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. The\nchase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength,\nborn of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My\u2014my companions?\" he demanded weakly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massive\nof shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw,\nraven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk,\nloosed a satisfied grunt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip\u2014but\nhe managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelm\nhim, and confronted the big man boldly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What,\" he stormed, \"is the meaning of this?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then his\nraven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawed\nin boisterous mirth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hear that?\" he roared to his companions. \"Quite a guy, ain't he?\n'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?\"\nThen he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement in\nhis eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. His\ntone assumed a biting edge. \"The meanin' is, my bucko,\" he answered\nmirthlessly, \"that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you have\na sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast and\nstraight!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Talk?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nice\nhaul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way.\" The burly one\nchuckled coarsely. \"We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped matters\nout by comin' to us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend's\nominous warning. \"\u2014if your message was intercepted, you may have\nplayed into the hands of\u2014\" He said slowly, \"Then you\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  the\nLorelei's men?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron\u2014where did\nit come from?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And it occurred to Warren suddenly that although the big man\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  hold\nthe whip hand, he was still not in possession of the most important\nsecret of all! While the location of the ekalastron mine remained a\nsecret, a deadlock existed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And if I won't tell\u2014?\" he countered shrewdly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, then, sailor\u2014\" The pirate leader's hamlike fists tightened, and\na cold light glinted in his eyes\u2014\"why, then I guess maybe I'll have to\nbeat it out o' you!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "6", "uid": "faba8d4b0a8044c6b3dded264cbe0e2d", "response_text": "Chip Warren and his crew of Salvation Smith, a righteous missionary, and Syd Palmer, mechanic, have landed in the Belt on their spaceship Chickadee II after discovering a mountain of ekalastron, a highly sought-after material.

Syd and Salvation do not join him, as the repairmen were still encasing their ship with ekalastron. \nThe asteroid Danae has a gravity that\u2019s modeled after Earth, a good atmosphere, and features a wide variety of interplanetary species.

The Martian runs off before the cop reveals himself to be Johnny Haldane, Chip\u2019s old friend. After catching up briefly, Chip tells Johnny about their find on Titania and explains that they turned it all over to the Space Patrol, before visiphoning Earth. At this, Johnny becomes upset and explains that their message could have been intercepted by the mythic Lorelei. Chip laughs him off, but Johnny explains that for the past two months a beautiful blonde woman has been luring spacemen to their doom and stealing all their cargo. They decide to take on the Lorelei together, especially now that the Chickadee will be plated with ekalastron, an impenetrable material. Johnny claims he knows one of Lorelei\u2019s men is on Danae right now getting more supplies, so they could follow him back to their base. As he says that, Johnny saves Chip by throwing him to the floor and sacrificing himself. He is killed by an assailant with a scar on his face. Chip tries to save his friend, but the bartender rushes back in with a horde of people, claiming Chip is the murder. Chip runs away, chasing after the true killer, but loses him. He runs back to the Chickadee, and they quickly take off, even though the plating was only halfway finished. Syd and Salvation question him, and he explains the situation, as they follow the scarred man to the Bog, an extremely dangerous asteroid-ridden area. As Chip attempts to look through the perilens, a beautiful woman pops up, crying for help: the Lorelei. Chaos ensues, and they try to get her off their transmission, while a blast rocks the hull.

Syd Palmer is a friend of his, and Salvation Smith is a missionary who handles a gun famously well: they warn Chip to be careful of the dangers of the Belt on his night out. Chip heads to the casino on the surface of the asteroid, passing members of many races as he heads to the small private bar in the back of the casino, empty except for a Martian bartender. As soon as he gets his scotch, someone bursts in yelling for Chip's arrest. After the bartender runs away, Chip recognizes Johnny Haldane, an old friend. They talk about Chip's recent discovery of an entire mountain's worth of No. 97, or ekalastron, a light and strong metal worth a lot of money. Instead of selling to anyone, Chip, Syd, and Salvation had sent a message to Earth about the cargo, and would handle the details later. Johnny is immediately concerned that \"the Lorelai\" may have intercepted this message--a pirate group much like the sirens who distract ships in the ocean, but in space. As Chip laughs at the idea of a mythical creature being involved, Johnny stops him to explain all of the related destruction that's happened in the past two months--only one person had escaped alive. Johnny explains that the ekalastron would be quite the prize for the Lorelai, and Chip needed to find protection. Chip reminds Johnny that his ship was being plated and could be indestructable, so they decide to go after the Lorelei together. Just then, there is an attack: Johnny is hit in the face with flame while pushing Chip out of the way. Johnny dies and the attacker flees when he hears footsteps, leaving Chip calling for help. Unfortunately, the Martian bartender thought Johnny's murder accusation had been serious, had gone to get help, and now assumes Chip is responsible for Johnny's death. A miner shoots at Chip, who runs to catch the real murderer to save himself. When he gets back to the Chickadee, he yells at Syd to get the ship moving, and spots the ship the murderer is leaving on. They move the ship as quickly as they can, and Chip catches his friends up as they fly towards the Bog, a region densely packed with asteroids. As they approach, they spot a phantom that is undeniably the Lorelei, calling for help. They try to modify their viewing equipment to get rid of the image, but she stays and keeps calling, and the ship was hit in the part that hadn't yet been plated. They are hit again and the men eventually pass out. As Chip comes to, he finds himself on the surface of a planet surrounded by pirates who laugh at him and explain that they want his ekalastron--they had intercepted Chip's message to Earth, but they still want to know where he got it.

Colonies\nhad vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships\nwhich had touched on some plague planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight\nspacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the\nalien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the\ncopper and purple shadows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker\nbrowns. Reflex action swung June's gun into line, and behind her\nsomeone's gun went off with a faint crackle of static, and made a hole\nin the leaves beside the specimen. Then for a while no one moved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This one looked like a man, a magnificently muscled, leanly graceful,\nhumanlike animal. Even in its callused bare feet, it was a head taller\nthan any of them. Red-haired, hawk-faced and darkly tanned, it stood\nbreathing heavily, looking at them without expression. At its side hung\na sheath knife, and a crossbow was slung across one wide shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They lowered their guns.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It needs a shave,\" Max said reasonably in their earphones, and he\nreached up to his helmet and flipped the switch that let his voice be\nheard. \"Something we could do for you, Mac?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The friendly drawl was the first voice that had broken the forest\nsounds. June smiled suddenly. He was right. The strict logic of\nevolution did not demand beards; therefore a non-human would not be\nwearing a three day growth of red stubble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still panting, the tall figure licked dry lips and spoke. \"Welcome to\nMinos. The Mayor sends greetings from Alexandria.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"English?\" gasped June.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We were afraid you would take off again before I could bring word to\nyou.... It's three hundred miles.... We saw your scout plane pass\ntwice, but we couldn't attract its attention.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  June looked in stunned silence at the stranger leaning against the\ntree. Thirty-six light years\u2014thirty-six times six trillion miles\nof monotonous space travel\u2014to be told that the planet was already\nsettled! \"We didn't know there was a colony here,\" she said. \"It is not\non the map.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We were afraid of that,\" the tall bronze man answered soberly. \"We\nhave been here three generations and yet no traders have come.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max shifted the kit strap on his shoulder and offered a hand. \"My name\nis Max Stark, M.D. This is June Walton, M.D., Hal Barton, M.D., and\nGeorge Barton, Hal's brother, also M.D.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Patrick Mead is the name,\" smiled the man, shaking hands casually.\n\"Just a hunter and bridge carpenter myself. Never met any medicos\nbefore.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The grip was effortless but even through her airproofed glove June\ncould feel that the fingers that touched hers were as hard as padded\nsteel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What\u2014what is the population of Minos?\" she asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked down at her curiously for a moment before answering. \"Only\none hundred and fifty.\" He smiled. \"Don't worry, this isn't a city\nplanet yet. There's room for a few more people.\" He shook hands with\nthe Bartons quickly. \"That is\u2014you are people, aren't you?\" he asked\nstartlingly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\" said Max with a poise that June admired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, you are all so\u2014so\u2014\" Patrick Mead's eyes roamed across the\nfaces of the group. \"So varied.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They could find no meaning in that, and stood puzzled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I mean,\" Patrick Mead said into the silence, \"all these\u2014interesting\ndifferent hair colors and face shapes and so forth\u2014\" He made a vague\nwave with one hand as if he had run out of words or was anxious not to\ninsult them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joke?\" Max asked, bewildered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  June laid a hand on his arm. \"No harm meant,\" she said to him over the\nintercom. \"We're just as much of a shock to him as he is to us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She addressed a question to the tall colonist on outside sound. \"What\nshould a person look like, Mr. Mead?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He indicated her with a smile. \"Like you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  June stepped closer and stood looking up at him, considering her own\ndescription. She was tall and tanned, like him; had a few freckles,\nlike him; and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly\nhumorous blue eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and\nme?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin.\n\"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think\nthat people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit\nso many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I\nsuppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside\ndown!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits? The air\nis breathable.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For safety,\" June told him. \"We can't take any chances on plague.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the\nwind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take\noff the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins.\nMinos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two\nyears after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead\nfamilies. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all\nrelated, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way\npeople can look.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Plague.\n  </i>\n  \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting\nsickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to\ndo about it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for\nsome.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all\nthe books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion,\nand never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship\nwere indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone\nand machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace\nthem. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife\nand bow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any other diseases?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching\nawe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on\nthe intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Their job had been made easy by the coming of Pat. They went back to\nthe ship laughing, exchanging anecdotes with him. There was nothing\nnow to keep Minos from being the home they wanted, except the melting\nsickness, and, forewarned against it, they could take precautions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The polished silver and black column of the\n  <i>\n   Explorer\n  </i>\n  seemed to rise\nhigher and higher over the trees as they neared it. Then its symmetry\nblurred all sense of specific size as they stepped out from among the\ntrees and stood on the edge of the meadow, looking up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nice!\" said Pat. \"Beautiful!\" The admiration in his voice was warming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was a yacht,\" Max said, still looking up, \"second hand, an old-time\nbeauty without a sign of wear. Synthetic diamond-studded control board\nand murals on the walls. It doesn't have the new speed drives, but it\nbrought us thirty-six light years in one and a half subjective years.\nPlenty good enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tall tanned man looked faintly wistful, and June realized that\nhe had never had access to a full library, never seen a movie, never\nexperienced luxury. He had been born and raised on Minos.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"May I go aboard?\" Pat asked hopefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max unslung the specimen kit from his shoulder, laid it on the carpet\nof plants that covered the ground and began to open it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tests first,\" Hal Barton said. \"We have to find out if you people\nstill carry this so-called melting sickness. We'll have to de-microbe\nyou and take specimens before we let you on board. Once on, you'll be\nno good as a check for what the other Meads might have.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max was taking out a rack and a stand of preservative bottles and\nhypodermics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you going to jab me with those?\" Pat asked with interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're just a specimen animal to me, bud!\" Max grinned at Pat Mead,\nand Pat grinned back. June saw that they were friends already, the\ntall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a\nstab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being\nsmaller and frailer than Pat Mead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lie down,\" Max told him, \"and hold still. We need two spinal fluid\nsamples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the\narm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed\nand inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine\nnerve surgeon on Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship\nand angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing. Then, suddenly,\nit veered and headed back, and Reno Unrich's voice came tinnily from\ntheir earphones:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that you've got? Hey, what are you docs doing down there?\" He\nbanked again and came to a stop, hovering fifty feet away. June could\nsee his startled face looking through the glass at Pat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hal Barton switched to a narrow radio beam, explained rapidly and\npointed in the direction of Alexandria. Reno's plane lifted and flew\naway over the odd-colored forest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The plane will drop a note on your town, telling them you got\nthrough to us,\" Hal Barton told Pat, who was sitting up watching Max\ndexterously put the blood and spinal fluids into the right bottles\nwithout exposing them to air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We won't be free to contact your people until we know if they still\ncarry melting sickness,\" Max added. \"You might be immune so it doesn't\nshow on you, but still carry enough germs\u2014if that's what caused it\u2014to\nwipe out a planet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you do carry melting sickness,\" said Hal Barton, \"we won't be able\nto mingle with your people until we've cleared them of the disease.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Starting with me?\" Pat asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Starting with you,\" Max told him ruefully, \"as soon as you step on\nboard.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"More needles?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, and a few little extras thrown in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rough?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few minutes later, standing in the stalls for spacesuit\ndecontamination, being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant, bathed in\nglares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation, June remembered that and\ncompared Pat Mead's treatment to theirs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the\n  <i>\n   Explorer\n  </i>\n  , stored carefully in sealed tanks and containers,\nwas the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall. It was a solution of enzymes\nso like the key catalysts of the human cell nucleus that it caused\nchemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. Nothing\ncould live in contact with it but human cells; any alien intruder to\nthe body would die. Nucleocat Cureall was its trade name.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the cureall alone was not enough for complete safety. Plagues had\nbeen known to slay too rapidly and universally to be checked by human\ntreatment. Doctors are not reliable; they die. Therefore spaceways and\ninterplanetary health law demanded that ship equipment for guarding\nagainst disease be totally mechanical in operation, rapid and efficient.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somewhere near them, in a series of stalls which led around and\naround like a rabbit maze, Pat was being herded from stall to stall\nby peremptory mechanical voices, directed to soap and shower, ordered\nto insert his arm into a slot which took a sample of his blood, given\nsolutions to drink, bathed in germicidal ultraviolet, shaken by sonic\nblasts, breathing air thick with sprays of germicidal mists, being\ndirected to put his arms into other slots where they were anesthesized\nand injected with various immunizing solutions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, he would be put in a room of high temperature and extreme\ndryness, and instructed to sit for half an hour while more fluids were\ndripped into his veins through long thin tubes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All legal spaceships were built for safety. No chance was taken of\nallowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  June stepped from the last shower stall into the locker room, zipped\noff her spacesuit with a sigh of relief, and contemplated herself in a\nwall mirror. Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've got a good figure,\" she said thoughtfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max turned at the door. \"Why this sudden interest in your looks?\" he\nasked suspiciously. \"Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally\nget something to eat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait a minute.\" She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully,\nusing a combination from the ship's directory. \"How're you doing, Pat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray. There was a startled\nchuckle. \"Voices, too! Hello, June. How do you tell a machine to go\njump in the lake?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you hungry?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No food since yesterday.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll have a banquet ready for you when you get out,\" she told Pat and\nhung up, smiling. Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which\nmade shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing\nhamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of\nPat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of\nantihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system\nwould treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human\nblood cells, and fight back against them violently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive,\nso that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human\ncells, and thus succumb more rapidly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a\nviewplate. It showed a long scene of mountains in the distance on the\nhorizon, and between them, rising step by step as they grew farther\naway, the low rolling hills, bronze and red with patches of clear green\nwhere there were fields.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone was looking out, standing very still, as if she had been\nthere a long time\u2014Bess St. Clair, a Canadian woman. \"It looks like\nWinnipeg,\" she told them as they paused. \"When are you doctors going to\nlet us out of this blithering barberpole? Look,\" she pointed. \"See that\npatch of field on the south hillside, with the brook winding through\nit? I've staked that hillside for our house. When do we get out?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Reno Ulrich's tiny scout plane buzzed slowly in from the distance and\nbegan circling lazily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sooner than you think,\" Max told her. \"We've discovered a castaway\ncolony on the planet. They've done our tests for us by just living\nhere. If there's anything here to catch, they've caught it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"People on Minos?\" Bess's handsome ruddy face grew alive with\nexcitement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One of them is down in the medical department,\" June said. \"He'll be\nout in twenty minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May I go see him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" said Max. \"Show him the way to the dining hall when he gets\nout. Tell him we sent you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right!\" She turned and ran down the ramp like a small girl going to a\nfire. Max grinned at June and she grinned back. After a year and a half\nof isolation in space, everyone was hungry for the sight of new faces,\nthe sound of unfamiliar voices.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They climbed the last two turns to the cafeteria, and entered to a rich\nsubdued blend of soft music and quiet conversations. The cafeteria\nwas a section of the old dining room, left when the rest of the ship\nhad been converted to living and working quarters, and it still had\nthe original finely grained wood of the ceiling and walls, the sound\nabsorbency, the soft music spools and the intimate small light at each\ntable where people leisurely ate and talked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stood in line at the hot foods counter, and behind her June\ncould hear a girl's voice talking excitedly through the murmur of\nconversation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\u2014new man, honest! I saw him through the viewplate when they came in.\nHe's down in the medical department. A real frontiersman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The line drew abreast of the counters, and she and Max chose three\nheaping trays, starting with hydroponic mushroom steak, raised in\nthe growing trays of water and chemicals; sharp salad bowl with rose\ntomatoes and aromatic peppers; tank-grown fish with special sauce; four\ndifferent desserts, and assorted beverages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently they had three tottering trays successfully maneuvered to a\ntable. Brant St. Clair came over. \"I beg your pardon, Max, but they are\nsaying something about Reno carrying messages to a colony of savages,\nfor the medical department. Will he be back soon, do you know?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max smiled up at him, his square face affectionate. Everyone liked the\nshy Canadian. \"He's back already. We just saw him come in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, fine.\" St. Clair beamed. \"I had an appointment with him to go out\nand confirm what looks like a nice vein of iron to the northeast. Have\nyou seen Bess? Oh\u2014there she is.\" He turned swiftly and hurried away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A very tall man with fiery red hair came in surrounded by an eagerly\ntalking crowd of ship people. It was Pat Mead. He stood in the doorway,\nalertly scanning the dining room. Sheer vitality made him seem even\nlarger than he was. Sighting June, he smiled and began to thread toward\ntheir table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look!\" said someone. \"There's the colonist!\" Shelia, a pretty, jeweled\nwoman, followed and caught his arm. \"Did you\n  <i>\n   really\n  </i>\n  swim across a\nriver to come here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Overflowing with good-will and curiosity, people approached from all\ndirections. \"Did you actually walk three hundred miles? Come, eat with\nus. Let me help choose your tray.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everyone wanted him to eat at their table, everyone was a specialist\nand wanted data about Minos. They all wanted anecdotes about hunting\nwild animals with a bow and arrow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He needs to be rescued,\" Max said. \"He won't have a chance to eat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  June and Max got up firmly, edged through the crowd, captured Pat and\nescorted him back to their table. June found herself pleased to be\nclaiming the hero of the hour.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Pat sat in the simple, subtly designed chair and leaned back almost\nvoluptuously, testing the way it gave and fitted itself to him. He\nran his eyes over the bright tableware and heaped plates. He looked\naround at the rich grained walls and soft lights at each table. He said\nnothing, just looking and feeling and experiencing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When we build our town and leave the ship,\" June explained, \"we\nwill turn all the staterooms back into the lounges and ballrooms and\ncocktail bars that used to be inside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" Pat said negligently. He cocked his head to\nthe music, and tried to locate its source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's big of you,\" said Max with gentle irony.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They fell to, Pat beginning the first meal he had had in more than a\nday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most of the other diners finished when they were halfway through,\nand began walking over, diffidently at first, then in another wave\nof smiling faces, handshakes, and introductions. Pat was asked about\ncrops, about farming methods, about rainfall and floods, about farm\nanimals and plant breeding, about the compatibility of imported Earth\nseeds with local ground, about mines and strata.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no need to protect him. He leaned back in his chair and\ndrawled answers with the lazy ease of a panther; where he could think\nof no statistic, he would fill the gap with an anecdote. It developed\nthat he enjoyed spinning campfire yarns and especially being the center\nof interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Between bouts of questions, he ate with undiminished and glowing relish.\n </p>\n <p>\n  June noticed that the female specialists were prolonging the questions\nmore than they needed, clustering around the table laughing at his\njokes, until presently Pat was almost surrounded by pretty faces,\neager questions, and chiming laughs. Shelia the beautiful laughed most\nchimingly of all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  June nudged Max, and Max shrugged indifferently. It wasn't anything a\nman would pay attention to, perhaps. But June watched Pat for a moment\nmore, then glanced uneasily back to Max. He was eating and listening\nto Pat's answers and did not feel her gaze. For some reason Max looked\nalmost shrunken to her. He was shorter than she had realized; she had\nforgotten that he was only the same height as herself. She was dimly\naware of the clear lilting chatter of female voices increasing at Pat's\nend of the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That guy's a menace,\" Max said, and laughed to himself, cutting\nanother slice of hydroponic mushroom steak. \"What's eating you?\" he\nadded, glancing aside at her when he noticed her sudden stillness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" she said hastily, but she did not turn back to watching Pat\nMead. She felt disloyal. Pat was only a superb animal. Max was the man\nshe loved. Or\u2014was he? Of course he was, she told herself angrily.\nThey had gone colonizing together because they wanted to spend their\nlives together; she had never thought of marrying any other man. Yet\nthe sense of dissatisfaction persisted, and along with it a feeling of\nguilt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Len Marlow, the protein tank-culture technician responsible for the\nmushroom steaks, had wormed his way into the group and asked Pat a\nquestion. Now he was saying, \"I don't dig you, Pat. It sounds like\nyou're putting the people into the tanks instead of the vegetables!\" He\nglanced at them, looking puzzled. \"See if you two can make anything of\nthis. It sounds medical to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pat leaned back and smiled, sipping a glass of hydroponic burgundy.\n\"Wonderful stuff. You'll have to show us how to make it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Len turned back to him. \"You people live off the country, right? You\nhunt and bring in steaks and eat them, right? Well, say I have one of\nthose steaks right here and I want to eat it, what happens?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Go ahead and eat it. It just wouldn't digest. You'd stay hungry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\" Len was aggrieved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Chemical differences in the basic protoplasm of Minos. Different\namino linkages, left-handed instead of right-handed molecules in the\ncarbohydrates, things like that. Nothing will be digestible here until\nyou are adapted chemically by a little test-tube evolution. Till then\nyou'd starve to death on a full stomach.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pat's side of the table had been loaded with the dishes from two trays,\nbut it was almost clear now and the dishes were stacked neatly to one\nside. He started on three desserts, thoughtfully tasting each in turn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Test-tube evolution?\" Max repeated. \"What's that? I thought you people\nhad no doctors.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a story.\" Pat leaned back again. \"Alexander P. Mead, the head of\nthe Mead clan, was a plant geneticist, a very determined personality\nand no man to argue with. He didn't want us to go through the struggle\nof killing off all Minos plants and putting in our own, spoiling the\nface of the planet and upsetting the balance of its ecology. He decided\nthat he would adapt our genes to this planet or kill us trying. He did\nit all right.'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did which?\" asked June, suddenly feeling a sourceless prickle of fear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Adapted us to Minos. He took human cells\u2014\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She listened intently, trying to find a reason for fear in the\nexplanation. It would have taken many human generations to adapt to\nMinos by ordinary evolution, and that only at a heavy toll of death and\nhunger which evolution exacts. There was a shorter way: Human cells\nhave the ability to return to their primeval condition of independence,\nhunting, eating and reproducing alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alexander P. Mead took human cells and made them into phagocytes.\nHe put them through the hard savage school of evolution\u2014a thousand\ngenerations of multiplication, hardship and hunger, with the alien\nindigestible food always present, offering its reward of plenty to the\ncell that reluctantly learned to absorb it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Leucocytes can run through several thousand generations of evolution\nin six months,\" Pat Mead finished. \"When they reached to a point where\nthey would absorb Minos food, he planted them back in the people he\nhad taken them from.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What was supposed to happen then?\" Max asked, leaning forward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know exactly how it worked. He never told anybody much about\nit, and when I was a little boy he had gone loco and was wandering\nha-ha-ing around waving a test tube. Fell down a ravine and broke his\nneck at the age of eighty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A character,\" Max said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why was she afraid? \"It worked then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. He tried it on all the Meads the first year. The other settlers\ndidn't want to be experimented on until they saw how it worked out. It\nworked. The Meads could hunt, and plant while the other settlers were\nstill eating out of hydroponics tanks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It worked,\" said Max to Len. \"You're a plant geneticist and a tank\nculture expert. There's a job for you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh-\n  <i>\n   uh\n  </i>\n  !\" Len backed away. \"It sounds like a medical problem to me.\nHuman cell control\u2014right up your alley.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is a one-way street,\" Pat warned. \"Once it is done, you won't be\nable to digest ship food. I'll get no good from this protein.

At that time, the party of doctors is hunting animals to test for contagion, which has been the reason for massive deaths on other planets. Suddenly, an animal-like man, Patrick Mead, appears, who was sent by the Mayor from far away. The party is surprised to see an English-speaking human as there is no colony on Minos according to the map. Patrick informs them that the population of Minos is one hundred and fifty, and the planet has room for more. The variety of the group's appearances puzzles Patrick as in his opinion all people should look like June, a member of the party. She looks similar to Patrick himself - tanned, tall, with freckles and wavy red hair. He tells about a plague which happened in the past and killed everyone except the Mead families who were immune. As all the people alive are related, they look similar. The disease was called the melting sickness and it killed all the doctors before they studied it. The colony's ship went off forever to avoid the contagion and took everything with them. The party returns to the ship with Pat, considering the planet the desirable home. Pat admires the ship as he was raised on Minos without any luxuries or technologies. Max, June's boyfriend and also a doctor, tests Pat for the melting sickness before letting him into the ship. Reno's scout plane comes in surprise and is updated about the local colony. The newcomers have cureall, a multi-purpose cure from any alien intrusion to the body, but for safety the ship equipment for testings is fully mechanical.

People are eager to meet Pat after a year and a half in isolation. Soon, he comes into the cafeteria and is surrounded by curious passengers. June becomes jealous of the female attention to Pat and compares him to Max, with the least significantly losing in appearance. Pat mentions that local food won't digest for the newcomers unless they are adapted by a test-tube evolution, a method used by his ancestor to avoid destroying the local flora but rather adapt the Mead's genes to local food. That leads to the inability to digest the ship's food, only the products of Minos. For some reason June feels fear. Hal comes and reports the hamsters tested before Pat was de-infected to be dead.

He explains that the population on Minos is small, only consisting of the Mead family, all which look alike.

The mysterious disease killed everyone except for the Mead family, and the people on Minos had tried to fly back into space for escape, but the crew never came back. The crew takes Pat back to their ship, and explains to him that in order to protect themselves against disease, tests and precautions are necessary. They run several procedures on Pat, including drawing his blood, bathing him in disinfectant, and injecting his blood into hamsters to see if he carried disease.

Len Marlow, a plant geneticist, listens as Pat tells him about food on Minos; when they had first arrived, they were unable to digest the plants and animals due to genetic differences. Their head of the clan, Alexander Mead, had managed to take human cells and adapt them to the life on Minos, ultimately allowing for them to eat and digest the food there. Pat implies that this process is necessary if the people on The Explorer want to settle on Minos.

The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n </p>\n <p>\n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n  <i>\n   her\n  </i>\n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight\n  <i>\n   short\n  </i>\n  days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his\nmother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed\nrapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence\nwas a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age\nan inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his\nfather now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every\nsecond of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Because in a few hours they'd be dead.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal\nstate hadn't he dreamed of\n  <i>\n   long\n  </i>\n  lives, valleys not of blasted stone\nbut green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then\nthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long\nlife? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and\ndepressing in eight short, vanishing days?\n </p>\n <p>\n  How had his people gotten into such a condition?\n </p>\n <p>\n  As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His mind flexed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cliff groaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Remember?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  IV\n </p>\n <p>\n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"War!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he vanished around a rock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n  <i>\n   eat\n  </i>\n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They ran back to the caves.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "edffa19010ea410197a4526feacbdcd9", "response_text": "The story begins with Sim being born in a cold cave. He\u2019s wailing with tears while his mom feverishly feeds him. Even though he is a newborn, he interestingly has some self-awareness. Sim looked around the cave and spotted some old people dying in a graphic, grotesque manner. He raged in angst and his mom moved to soothe him. \n\nSuddenly, his father goes to attack him and his mother with a knife. His father wants to kill him as he reasons that there is no reason to live. Sim\u2019s mother begs him not to and tells him to have faith that their son might live longer. After this altercation, Sim notices his sister, Dark, for the first time. Afterwards, he notices that his mother goes through a painful process of aging. Sim cannot seem to find anywhere to look in the cave that is not horrifying to look at and cries himself at these revelations. \n\nBecause the people on this planet age incredibly fast, Sim goes through a lot of understanding and self-thought during the first day of his life. Eventually, the next day arrives. As an avalanche falls into the valley, Sim\u2019s father takes him and they both jump into the avalanche and are carried by it into the valley. Sim and his family enjoy the valley during the time that it is livable to play within its borders. During this time, Sim\u2019s mother and father become upset as there is a pressing realization that they both will die soon. They all hurriedly return back to their cave as the sun is coming out and would kill them if they are caught in its rays. A young child is caught in the sun\u2019s rays and burned to death. \n\nUpon their return, Sim\u2019s mother and father toast icicles to signify their last day. Throughout the day, Sim continues to grow and gain more intelligence. His mother feeds him and lovingly embraces him. Upon their mother\u2019s instruction, Dark takes Sim out into the valley and watches over him. While they are in the valley, the two parents die from old age. In the valley, Sim wonders why no one else asks about the metal seed in the distance that he sees. He thinks it is a potential escape plan. \n\nWhile outside, Sim observes meaning screaming a war rallying cry. When he finds a red berry, a boy named Chion goes and steals it from Sim. Dark slaps the boy and scolds him for stealing the berry. Sim thinks to himself about how he does not understand the fighting nature people have when life is already so short. He then threatens Chion and acknowledges the boy as his new enemy. Dark gives him advice about enemies and friends, how quick they can be made. However, Sim gets distracted with lustful thoughts about a girl that passes him. Dark mentions that she is concerned for his future as he will have to fight Chion. They then both run back to the caves. \n"}, {"worker_id": "105", "uid": "5a92504a82d7428a8f55813c490053e4", "response_text": "Sim is just born in a cave, which is a nightmare. His mother feeds him and he grows larger and larger. There is a scary man in the farther corner of the cave, Sim's father with eyes being the only alive things on his face. Behind, the old people are sitting in the tunnel and dying. The father heads towards Sim with a knife to kill the child as there is nothing for him to live for. The mother disagrees and takes the weapon away. Sim's sister, Dark, is eating in the same room. The mother is also aging and dying. Sim understands everything though he is just one hour old and he is terrified. On the planet the days are flame, and the nights are ice, with dawn and sunset being the only bearable time to go outside. For that reason people live on the cliffs and they are about to die. Sim is about to live only eight days and all without sleep. Every age passes by really fast and people get old in days on the horrible planet. Ten thousand days ago metal seeds crashed on this planet bringing the people here, who rushed to hide in the cliffs and grew old in days. The only usable ship after the crash is still beyond the valley of cliffs, with some scientists working in it. Sim is determined to go there when he grows old and wise enough. At dawn, Sim's father takes him outside, leaps out during an avalanche and makes it alive. Fruits appear and as Sim eats, he rapidly gets knowledge. The mother cries for the transiency of time and wants to take the last look at everything, as they will die soon. The sun is rising but she is not afraid to be caught by it. Everyone rushes to the hideouts, including the family, but someone's child doesn't make it and is burnt. Sim glimpses the metal ship, his dream. Sim's parents are too feeble and send Dark to play with Sim at sunset, while they die. At dawn a funeral procession takes place for all dead during the night. Sim already can walk along. Dark and Sim discuss what they know when some people run to fight others. The kids are surprised as life is too short to fight. A boy, Chion, fights Sim for a berry. Sim understands what enemies and friends are, and the boy promises to kill him the next day. Dark explains how those are made and says that people around believe they can earn another day of life by killing the other. Suddenly, Sim notices and touches a girl, who he knows will become his wife tomorrow and they will be buried together. The girl introduces herself as Lyte, and along with Sim, Chion promises to remember the name.

He immediately  is aware of feelings and sensations and is introduced to the dreadful world his family lives in. Sim is fed fruits and grass by his mother as he grows larger, and he sees the others in the cave begin to die. As Sim's mother holds him, his father suddenly takes him and holds a knife to him, planning to kill him. Sim's mother pleads as his father wonders what he has to live for. Sim sees his sister, Dark, beside him, and his mother manages to grab the knife from his father. Sim soon begins to understand, through racial memory, the conditions he lives in. He understands that the planet he is on, on which the people before him had crashed, casts deadly radiation on the planet which causes the people on it to live for only eight days. The land outside the cave is too dangerous and deadly during the days and nights; only when it is dawn or sunset do the valleys bloom with nature and the people can enjoy its short life. Sim begins to age rapidly, aware of the eight days he has to live, and desperate to find a solution. He has a vision of a spaceship on a far out mountain, intact but impossible to get to, where a group of scientists struggle to find a way home. Sim longs to get to the ship and prolong his life. As dawn approaches, the people in the cave get ready to head down to the valley, where the daily Avalanche occurs; Sim's father recklessly takes him through the avalanche, barely surviving. Sim watches the valley become flooded with life as he gains more knowledge and understanding. As dawn fades, Sim's parents acknowledge that it is their last day of living, and everyone bolts back into the cave, a child being left behind and scorched by the sun. Sim's parents make a toast on their last day of life, and he watches them age until they are unable to walk and struggle to speak, while Sim himself notices his growth and ability. At sunset, Sim's parents are no longer able to go outside, and Sim says his first word, \"Why\". The next day, Sim's parents pass, and Dark becomes his caretaker. They frolic in the valley after the funeral procession, where Sim sees a group of men engage in war and is perplexed. He is then knocked to the ground by a child named Chion, making his first enemy. Dark explains that enemies are inevitable, especially due to the superstition some believe about gaining more days of life by killing others.

His mother is fearful, but she continues to feed him things such as ice-nipples, pebble-fruits, and valley-grass. As his father approaches, people sitting in the tunnel all die. His father raises the knife over him and plans to kill him, but his mother flings herself upon the back of his father. He wants to kill Sim\u2019s sister too, but seeing his wife\u2019s state makes him change his mind. Sim begins to understand that he is on a planet next to the sun, with cold nights and hot days. Most of the people bring their children out during dawn and sunset to play because these are the only times the climate is bearable. Sim knows that he has exactly eight days to live. Sim feels that it is unfair that he only has eight days to live before he dies and wonders how the people have gotten into this situation. He gets flashbacks of a crash that brought men and women to the planet; their bodies are altered so that they live and die in a week. He tries to think about what he can do to save them and suddenly gets another image of a deserted spaceship on a low mountain. His father wakes him up to announce that it is dawn, and the Avalanche comes. As people push towards the dawn, the rocks fall too. His father lifts him up, and they narrowly avoid being killed by one. Dark runs ahead, and Sim wonders why there is laughing. Suddenly, he sees plants come to life and fruit begin to sprout, giving him new knowledge. His parents discuss how this is the last time they will see these sights again; the sun begins to rise again, and they all leave. Sim watches a young child running in the flatness, but the child dies before he makes it. His parents toast one last time, and Sim watches them age rapidly from one stage to another. Before dying, his mother tells Dark to take care of him. Sim speaks for the first time as his parents die. On the second day, there is a funeral procession for the people who have died the previous night. Dark and Sim go outside to see fifty young men go to war, which makes him bewildered as to why people fight when their lives are already so short. A small boy attacks him, and he introduces himself as Chion. Sim realizes that this is his enemy as Chion says that he will be big enough to kill him tomorrow. He sees his future wife named Lyte, and it seems that Chion is interested as well. Dark tells him to eat so he will be strong enough to fight.

Is the most callous\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n </i>\n <p>\n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n  <i>\n   Kumaji\n  </i>\n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Poisoned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\nthey're gone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you stayed here\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Steve felt irrational hatred then. He thought it would help if he could\nfind some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way\nhe felt, he knew, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists,\ntrekking across a parched wilderness\u2014to the safety of Oasis City\u2014or\ndeath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on,\" Steve said, making up his mind. \"The unicopter can hold two\nin a pinch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're going after them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've got to. They're my people. I've been away too long.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say, you're young Cantwell, aren't you? Now I remember.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, I'm Steve Cantwell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not going anyplace, young fellow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you can't stay here, without any good water to drink, without\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm staying,\" the old man said, still without self-pity, just\nmatter-of-factly. \"The Earth folks have no room for me and I can't blame\n'em. The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good,\nlong life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll\nneed every extra strong right arm they can get. You got any weapons?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Too bad. Well, good-bye and good luck.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you can't\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I'm staying. I want to stay. This is my home. It's the only home\nI'll ever have. Good luck, young fellow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly, Steve walked to his unicopter. It was nothing more than a small\nmetal disk on which to stand, and a shaft with four turbo-blades. It\ncould do sixty miles an hour at an elevation of two thousand feet.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Steve turned the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse ran back\nto the old man and gave him his canteen, turning away before it could be\nrefused and striding quickly back to the unicopter and getting himself\nairborne without looking at the deserted village or the old man again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man's voice called after him: \"Tell the people ... hurry ...\nKumaji looking for them to kill ... desert wind ought to wipe out their\ntrail ... but hurry....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind.\nSteve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on\nhate-haze. He circled wider and wider, seeking his people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hours later he spotted the caravan in the immensity of sand and\nwasteland. He brought the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and\na whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the\nslow-moving column. It was like something out of Earth's Middle\nEast\u2014and Middle Ages. They had even imported camels for their life here\non the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel was a better beast of\nburden than anything the Sirius II wastelands had to offer. They walked\nbeside the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with\nthe swaying baggage of their belongings. They moved through the sands\nwith agonizing slowness. Already, after only one day's travel, Steve\ncould see that some of the people were spent and exhausted and had to\nride on camelback. They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five\nhundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hullo!\" Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding\nclumsily through the sand toward him. \"Cantwell's the name,\" Steve said.\n\"I'm one of you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bleak hostility in his face, the man approached. \"Cantwell. Yeah, I\nremember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh,\nno. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing\nhere now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias\nWhiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a\nboy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in\nhis eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in\nhis mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was\nwell-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a\nbig muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had\nhardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve\nCantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the\nKumajis, and had grown rich\u2014by colony standards\u2014at his business. Now,\nSteve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the\nothers\u2014either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a\nnew colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation.\nPerhaps that explained his bitterness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.\nThey hardly seemed to be moving at all. \"Is my aunt all right?\" Steve\nsaid. She was the only family he remembered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tobias Whiting shook his head slowly. \"I hate to be the one to tell you\nthis. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died\nfrom the poisoned water last night.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was\npity\u2014pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death.\nSadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  The caravan reached them then. The first person Steve saw was a girl.\nShe wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face\u2014it would be a\npretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized\u2014was etched with\nlines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. \"Who is he, Dad?\" the\ngirl said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Young Cantwell. Remember?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten\nyears ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly.\nShe was a woman now....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Steve Cantwell?\" Mary said. \"Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I\u2014I'm\nsorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your\naunt. If there's anything I can do....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a\nslim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time\nlike this was little short of amazing, especially since it was\ncompletely genuine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He appreciated it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tobias Whiting said: \"Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get\nalong with the Kumaji. I had a pretty good business here, you know\nthat.\" He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. \"But I\nnever got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be\npoor again. We could have been rich.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve asked, \"What happened to all your profits?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll\nnever see it again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to\nher. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding\nand hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up\nto recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias\nWhiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of\nthem, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was\ncomforting and reassuring.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.\nTheir water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to\nreach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why?\" someone asked. \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\nday before said: \"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\u2014with the\nKumaji.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, wait a minute,\" one of Whiting's friends said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait, nothing.\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\ncolony. \"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for\nthat money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I was told,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" Gort went on relentlessly. \"Then this is what I figure must\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\n'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the\nKumaji, they won't just give it to him\u2014not by a long sight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No?\" someone asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No sir. They'll trade. For our location. And if Whiting went off like\nthat without even saying good-bye to his girl here, my guess is he'll\nmake the trade.\" His voice reflected some bitterness.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Mary went to Gort and slapped his face. The elderly man did not even\nblink. \"Well,\" he asked her gently, \"did your pa tell you he was going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"N-no,\" Mary said. There were tears in her eyes, but she did not cry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gort turned to Steve. \"Cantwell, can he get far in that 'copter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve shook his head. \"Ten or fifteen miles is all. Almost out of fuel,\nMr. Gort. You saw how I took her up for only a quick mile swing each\nday. He won't get far.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He'll crash in the desert?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Crash or crash-land,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mary sobbed, and bit her lip, and was silent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've got to stop him,\" Gort said. \"And fast. If he gets to the Kumaji,\nthey'll send down a raiding party and we'll be finished. We could never\nfight them off without the protection of our village. Near as I can\nfigure, there's a Kumaji base fifty miles due north of here. Whiting\nknows it too, so that's where he'll be going, I figure. Can't spare more\nthan a couple of men to look for him, though, in case the Kumaji find\nus\u2014or are led to us\u2014and attack.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve said, \"I should have taken something out of the 'copter every\nnight, so it couldn't start. I'll go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mary came forward boldly. \"I have to go. He's my father. If he crashed\nout there, he may be hurt. He may be\u2014dying.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gort looked at her. \"And if he's trying to sell us out to the Kumajis?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then\u2014then I'll do whatever Steve asks me to. I promise.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's good enough for me,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few minutes later, armed with atorifles and their share of the food\nand water that was left, Steve and Mary set out northward across the\nsand while the caravan continued east. Fear of what they might find\nmounted.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  The first night, they camped in the lee of low sandhills. The second\nnight they found a small spring with brackish but drinkable water. On\nthe third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji\nsettlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or\n  <i>\n   thlotback\n  </i>\n  , the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the\nsands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.\nSteve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond\ngrew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out\nhere with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her\nheart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in\norder to regain his fortune.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and\nmade their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had\nexpected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he\nescaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the\nKumaji encampment by now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\" Mary said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of\nthe rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Steve said. \"It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it\nall right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To go\u2014to them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think so, Mary. I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm\nsorry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What\n  <i>\n   can\n  </i>\n  we do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"North?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"North.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And if by some miracle we find him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve said nothing. The answer\u2014capture or death\u2014was obvious. But you\ncouldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you?\n </p>\n <p>\n  As it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own\nefforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were\nspotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on\ntheir\n  <i>\n   thlots\n  </i>\n  . Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel\naside. \"They'd kill us,\" he said. \"We can only surrender.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were hobbled and led painfully across the sand. They were taken\nthat way to a small Kumaji encampment, and thrust within a circular\ntent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tobias Whiting was in there.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Mary!\" he cried. \"My God! Mary....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We came for you, Dad,\" she said coldly. \"To stop you. To ... to kill\nyou if necessary.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mary....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, Dad, why did you do it? Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We couldn't start all over again, could we? You have a right to live\nthe sort of life I planned for you. You....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Whiting,\" Steve said, \"did you tell them yet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. No, I haven't. I have information to trade, sure. But I want to\nmake sure it's going to the right people. I want to get our....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dad! Our money, and all those deaths?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It doesn't matter now. I\u2014I had changed my mind, Mary. Truly. But now,\nnow that you're a prisoner, what if I don't talk? Don't you see, they'll\ntorture you. They'll make you talk. And that way\u2014we get nothing. I\ncouldn't stand to see them hurt you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can do\u2014what they think they have to do. I'll tell them nothing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You won't have to,\" Whiting said. \"I'll tell them when we reach the\nlarger settlement. They're taking us there tomorrow, they told me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then we've got to get out of here tonight,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The low sun cast the shadow of their guard against the\n  <i>\n   thlot\n  </i>\n  skin wall\nof their tent. He was a single man, armed with a long, pike-like weapon.\nWhen darkness came, if the guard were not increased....\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were brought a pasty gruel for their supper, and ate in silence and\ndistaste, ate because they needed the strength. Mary said, \"Dad, I don't\nwant you to tell them anything. Dad, please. If you thought you were\ndoing it for me....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've made up my mind,\" Tobias Whiting said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mary turned to Steve, in despair. \"Steve,\" she said. \"Steve.\nDo\u2014whatever you have to do. I\u2014I'll understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve didn't answer her. Wasn't Whiting right now? he thought. If Steve\nsilenced him, wouldn't the Kumaji torture them for the information?\nSteve could stand up to it perhaps\u2014but he couldn't stand to see them\nhurt Mary. He'd talk if they did that....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then silencing Whiting wasn't the answer. But the Kumajis had one\nwilling prisoner and two unwilling ones. They knew that. If the willing\none yelled for help but the yelling was kept to a minimum so only one\nguard, the man outside, came....\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Darkness in the Kumaji encampment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Far off, a lone tribesman singing a chant old as the desert.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you asleep?\" Mary asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dad is. Listen to the way he's breathing\u2014like a baby. As if\u2014as if he\nwasn't going to betray all our people. Oh, I hate him, I hate him!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve crawled to where the older man was sleeping. Tobias Whiting's\nvoice surprised him. \"I'm not asleep. I was thinking. I\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going to kill you,\" Steve said very softly, and sprang at Whiting.\nHe paused, though. It was a calculated pause, and Whiting cried out as\nSteve had hoped he would. Then his hands found the older man's throat\nand closed there\u2014not to kill him but to keep him from crying out again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside.\nSteve got up, met him halfway, felt the jarring contact of their bodies.\nThe pike came up dimly in the darkness, the point scraping against\nSteve's ribs as the guard lunged awkwardly. Steve's fingers sought the\nthick-muscled neck, clamped there\u2014squeezing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard writhed. His feet drummed the sand. With one hand he stabbed\nout wildly with the unwieldy pike. There was a cry from Mary and the\nguard managed a low squawking noise. Outside, the rest of the camp\nseemed undisturbed. There was death in Steve's strong tightening\nfingers. There had to be death there. Death for the Kumaji guard\u2014or\ndeath for the fleeing Earthmen, who had lost one colony and must seek\nanother.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  They fell together on the sand, the guard still struggling. Steve\ncouldn't release his throat to grab the pike. The guard stabbed out\nawkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,\nbut Steve hardly heard him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was\neither dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours. Steve\nhad never killed a man before, had never in violence and with intent to\nkill attacked a man....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Steve!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Mary, calling his name and crying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's Dad. Dad was\u2014hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out\nTobias Whiting's pain-contorted face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My stomach,\" Whiting said, gasping for breath. \"The pain....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He\ncouldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He\ntouched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying\nsoftly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You two ...\" Whiting gasped. \"You two ... Mary, Mary girl. Is\u2014he\u2014what\nyou want?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Dad. Oh, yes!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can get her out of here, Cantwell?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think so,\" Steve said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them\u2014due south. The Earthmen are\nheading due south. They'll go\u2014south. They won't find the caravan.\nYou'll\u2014all\u2014get away. If it's\u2014what you want, Mary.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: \"Isn't\nthere anything we can do for him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steve shook his head. \"But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to\ndeceive them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll live long enough,\" Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he\nwould. \"Luck to\u2014all of you. From a\u2014very foolish\u2014man....\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n  <i>\n   thlots\n  </i>\n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n  <i>\n   thlots\n  </i>\n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n  <i>\n   thlot's\n  </i>\n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n </p>\n <pre>\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Home is Where You Left It, by Adam Chase\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOME IS WHERE YOU LEFT IT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32890-h.htm or 32890-h.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/8/9/32890/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It is one of the human colonies, and it has never been accepted by the Kumaji tribesmen - the natives who have been raiding the settlements for years. Steve went to Earth to get an education, but now he came back to the planet. He flew from Oasis City to his native village on a unicopter only to find the deserted buildings and poisoned water. A Kumaji, who lived with the earthmen, tells him that the natives poisoned the well - three people died, and everybody else had to leave their home and walk to Oasis City through the desert wasteland. Now the Kumaji are looking for them to kill. The man stayed here to die since he\u2019s too old to flee or fight. Steve gives him his water canteen and flies away to find the other citizens. Hours later, he spots a caravan with camels. He first meets Tobias Whiting, who was the most successful man in the village when Steve was a child. The man greets him coldly and soon informs Steve that his aunt was one of the people who died from the poisoned water. Then he introduces him to his daughter Mary, the young woman who charms Steve. Tobias says he had a profitable business, but all his money is gone now. Three days later, he disappears, taking Steve\u2019s unicopter with him. The other members suppose that Tobias decided to trade the caravan\u2019s location for his profits, thus betraying them. Mary and Steve take some food and head towards the Kumaji base to the north of the caravan since Tobias probably decided to fly there. Four days later, they spot the empty unicopter and realize that Tobias must\u2019ve reached the base by now. They keep walking and soon surrender to the Kumajis, who put them in a circular tent where they meet Tobias. He explains to Mary that he wants to give her the life she deserves. Now he\u2019s determined to tell the Kumaji everything since his daughter got captured, and the Kumaji might torture her for information. Steve devises an escape plan: at night, he makes Tobias scream for a second to make one of the guards come in. Steve kills this one Kumaji, but the guard manages to lethally wound Tobias while fighting with the attacker. Whiting blesses Mary and Steve and orders them to leave, promising that he\u2019ll deceive the Kumaji and not share the true location of the caravan. The couple runs from the tent, and Steve kills several more guards before gliding off on the thlot\u2019s - desert animal - back with Mary.

He thinks about his childhood memories as he walks around, sadly thinking about living in the mud-house with his aunt after his parents were killed in a Kumaji raid, and the community center. As he tries the water, he realizes it is poisoned and stuffs sand in his mouth. As he goes into his aunt\u2019s house, an old Kumaji appears and tells him that everyone left. Steve thinks about the Kumaji raids from when he was a boy, and the old one talks about how the poisoned well was the last straw for the colonists to leave for Oasis City. Steve offers to take the old man with him in the unicopter, but he refuses and insists that the town is his home. Steve then goes to look for his people in the desert, and he finds them hiking through the desert. Steve goes to introduce himself again, but a man named Tobias Whiting only responds to him bitterly. He tells Steve that his aunt was one of the people who died, and his daughter Mary Whiting meets up with them later. Tobias Whiting complains about never having money because of the Kumaji, but Mary Whiting gives him a smile. Tobias disappears three days later, and he takes Steve\u2019s unicopter on the fourth night to go and retrieve his fortune. Mary slaps Gort, but he asks Steve how far Tobias will get with the unicopter. They get captured by the Kumaji and see that Tobias is waiting for them at the camp. Mary asks her father why he did what he did, and Steve asks if he has told them the information yet. At night, Mary asks if Steve has gone to sleep yet. Tobias is clearly asleep, and Mary is furious about her father betraying their people. Steve threatens to kill Tobias, but he ends up killing a guard instead. Tobias, however, is injured by the pike and lays there in pain. He asks Mary if Steve is the person she wants, and he tells the two of them to go south with the rest of the Earthmen. Tobias reassures them that he will live long enough to deceive the Kumaji. Steve escapes with Mary, killing a few more of the Kumaji before taking off on the thlot. They ride off into the distance, letting the sand obstruct their trail. Steve promises that they will tell the rest of the colony that Mary\u2019s father died as a hero, and she proclaims her love for him.

Upon arrival, he finds his village hastily abandoned - including his aunt - and the well poisoned. He finds an old Kumaji man in the community center, who informs him of what happened. The Kumaji tribesmen had raided the village as they felt the colony took up an oasis belonging to their own nomadic needs. By poisoning the well, the colonists were forced to travel by foot and camel across the arid desert to try and reach Oasis City, located 500 miles away. \n\nCantwell decides to hop into his unicopter to meet the travelling caravan and warn them of the Kumaji. He insists theres room for the old man, but the old man chooses to stay and die in his home. Reluctantly, Cantwell leaves the old man with the remaining water his in canteen. Later, Cantwell finds the caravan and reunites with familiar faces from his boyhood. This includes Tobias Whiting, previously the Colony's most successful man through his trading and business with the Kumajis, his daughter Mary, and some other childhood friends. Whiting describes how despite his relationship with the Kumajis and supposed riches, he and his daughter are forced to escape as refugees as well. \n\nDays after travelling with the caravan, Whiting disappears with Cantwell's unicopter. After discussing with some of the colony members, it is suggested that Whiting had gone off with the intention of trading with the Kumajis again: the colony's location in return for his money. Steve and Mary decide to follow and stop him. After a couple days travel, they find the unicopter crashed. Though initially reassured by the fact that Whiting was alive, they soon get spotted and captured by a band of Kumajis. Led to the Kumajis' encampment, they are met by Whiting. It seems that even if Whiting has changed his mind, the presence of his daughter and Cantwell could mean that the Kumajis were willing to torture the information of out Whiting regardless. \n\nAt night, Steve enacts a plan. He pretends to choke Whiting and draws the attention of the guard. They enter a scuffle, with the guard dying, but not without Whiting having taken a fatal stabbing from the guard's pike. Whiting vows instead to misinform the Kumajis on the caravan's location, and insists on the Steve getting Mary out safely.

When he arrives at his village, he sees the whole village is deserted, and attacked. The water well is poisoned, and the only person that he can find is an old man that tells him what happened. After overpopulation on earth increased dramatically, many humans turned to other planets to colonize. This desert planet was an example of that. The humans who lived in this village had always had trouble with the native tribe, as they weren\u2019t happy that the humans arrived at their home. This led to constant raids by the tribe, and is eventually what led to the humans abandoning the village to live in a city 500 miles away. After the old man told him what happened, Steve leaves in his ship to find the caravan of the surviving humans, as the old man wanted to stay in the village. After Steve finds them, he meets with people from the village, most of which remember him. Together, they continue their journey towards the large city and towards safety from the natives. One day, one of the men of the party takes Steve\u2019s ship. It is assumed that he wanted to negotiate with the natives, as he had a lot of money with them. In return, the man would give them the location of the rest of the humans. Steve and the man\u2019s daughter leave in order to find him and stop when. After getting captured by the natives, they meet with the man again, who wants to go ahead with his plan of betraying the rest of the humans.

Who\nwas to tell she had some rather startling interests?\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  woman in the\ndoorway looked like Mom in\nthe homier political cartoons.\nShe was plump, apple-cheeked,\nwhite-haired. She\nwore a fussy, old-fashioned\nnightgown, and was busily\nclutching a worn house-robe\naround her expansive middle.\nShe blinked at Sol Becker's\nrain-flattened hair and hang-dog\nexpression, and said:\n\"What is it? What do you\nwant?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry\u2014\" Sol's voice\nwas pained. \"The man in the\ndiner said you might put me\nup. I had my car stolen: a\nhitchhiker; going to Salinas ...\"\nHe was puffing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hitchhiker? I don't understand.\"\nShe clucked at the\nsight of the pool of water he\nwas creating in her foyer.\n\"Well, come inside, for heaven's\nsake. You're soaking!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks,\" Sol said gratefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the door firmly shut\nbehind him, the warm interior\nof the little house covered\nhim like a blanket. He\nshivered, and let the warmth\nseep over him. \"I'm terribly\nsorry. I know how late it is.\"\nHe looked at his watch, but\nthe face was too misty to\nmake out the hour.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Must be nearly three,\" the\nwoman sniffed. \"You couldn't\nhave come at a worse time. I\nwas just on my way to\ncourt\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The words slid by him. \"If\nI could just stay overnight.\nUntil the morning. I could\ncall some friends in San Fernando.\nI'm very susceptible to\nhead colds,\" he added inanely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, take those shoes off,\nfirst,\" the woman grumbled.\n\"You can undress in the parlor,\nif you'll keep off the rug.\nYou won't mind using the\nsofa?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, of course not. I'd be\nhappy to pay\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, tush, nobody's asking\nyou to pay. This isn't a hotel.\nYou mind if I go back upstairs?\nThey're gonna miss\nme at the palace.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, of course not,\" Sol\nsaid. He followed her into\nthe darkened parlor, and\nwatched as she turned the\nscrew on a hurricane-style\nlamp, shedding a yellow pool\nof light over half a flowery\nsofa and a doily-covered wing\nchair. \"You go on up. I'll be\nperfectly fine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Guess you can use a towel,\nthough. I'll get you one,\nthen I'm going up.

He patted\nhis face, and then scrubbed\nthe wet tangle of brown hair.\nCarefully, he stepped off the\ncarpet and onto the stone\nfloor in front of the fireplace.\nHe removed his\ndrenched coat and suit jacket,\nand squeezed water out\nover the ashes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stripped down to his\nunderwear, wondering about\nnext morning's possible embarrassment,\nand decided to\nuse the damp bath towel as a\nblanket. The sofa was downy\nand comfortable. He curled\nup under the towel, shivered\nonce, and closed his eyes.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  He\n  was tired and very\nsleepy, and his customary\nnightly review was limited to\na few detached thoughts\nabout the wedding he was\nsupposed to attend in Salinas\nthat weekend ... the hoodlum\nwho had responded to his\ngood-nature by dumping him\nout of his own car ... the slogging\nwalk to the village ...\nthe little round woman who\nwas hurrying off, like the\nWhite Rabbit, to some mysterious\nappointment on the\nupper floor ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he went to sleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A voice awoke him, shrill\nand questioning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you\n  <i>\n   nakkid\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes flew open, and he\npulled the towel protectively\naround his body and glared\nat the little girl with the rust-red\npigtails.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh, mister?\" she said,\npushing a finger against her\nfreckled nose. \"Are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he said angrily. \"I'm\nnot naked. Will you please\ngo away?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sally!\" It was Mom, appearing\nin the doorway of the\nparlor. \"You leave the gentleman\nalone.\" She went off\nagain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Sol said. \"Please let\nme get dressed. If you don't\nmind.\" The girl didn't move.\n\"What time is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dunno,\" Sally shrugged.\n\"I like poached eggs. They're\nmy favorite eggs in the whole\nworld.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's good,\" Sol said desperately.\n\"Now why don't you\nbe a good girl and eat your\npoached eggs. In the kitchen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ain't ready yet. You going\nto stay for breakfast?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not going to do anything\nuntil you get out of\nhere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She put the end of a pigtail\nin her mouth and sat down on\nthe chair opposite. \"I went to\nthe palace last night. They\nhad an exelution.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please,\" Sol groaned. \"Be\na good girl, Sally. If you let\nme get dressed, I'll show you\nhow to take your thumb off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, that's an old trick. Did\nyou ever see an exelution?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. Did you ever see a little\ngirl with her hide\ntanned?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Sally!\n  </i>\n  \" Mom again, sterner.\n\"You get out of there, or\nyou-know-what ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" the girl said\nblithely. \"I'm goin' to the palace\nagain. If I brush my\nteeth. Aren't you\n  <i>\n   ever\n  </i>\n  gonna\nget up?\" She skipped out of\nthe room, and Sol hastily sat\nup and reached for his\ntrousers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he had dressed, the\nclothes still damp and unpleasant\nagainst his skin, he\nwent out of the parlor and\nfound the kitchen. Mom was\nbusy at the stove. He said:\n\"Good morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Breakfast in ten minutes,\"\nshe said cheerfully. \"You like\npoached eggs?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. Do you have a telephone?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In the hallway. Party line,\nso you may have to wait.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried for fifteen minutes\nto get through, but there\nwas a woman on the line who\nwas terribly upset about a\ncotton dress she had ordered\nfrom Sears, and was telling\nthe world about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, he got his call\nthrough to Salinas, and a\nsleepy-voiced Fred, his old\nArmy buddy, listened somewhat\nindifferently to his tale\nof woe. \"I might miss the\nwedding,\" Sol said unhappily.\n\"I'm awfully sorry.\" Fred\ndidn't seem to be half as sorry\nas he was. When Sol hung\nup, he was feeling more despondent\nthan ever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man, tall and rangy, with\na bobbing Adam's apple and\na lined face, came into the\nhallway. \"Hullo?\" he said inquiringly.\n\"You the fella had\nthe car stolen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man scratched his ear.\n\"Take you over to Sheriff\nCoogan after breakfast. He'll\nlet the Stateys know about it.\nMy name's Dawes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol accepted a careful\nhandshake.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't get many people\ncomin' into town,\" Dawes\nsaid, looking at him curiously.\n\"Ain't seen a stranger in\nyears. But you look like the\nrest of us.\" He chuckled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mom called out: \"Breakfast!\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  At\n  the table, Dawes\nasked his destination.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wedding in Salinas,\" he\nexplained. \"Old Army friend\nof mine. I picked this hitchhiker\nup about two miles from\nhere. He\n  <i>\n   seemed\n  </i>\n  okay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never can tell,\" Dawes\nsaid placidly, munching egg.\n\"Hey, Ma. That why you\nwere so late comin' to court\nlast night?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right, Pa.\" She\npoured the blackest coffee\nSol had ever seen. \"Didn't\nmiss much, though.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What court is that?\" Sol\nasked politely, his mouth full.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Umagum,\" Sally said, a\npiece of toast sticking out\nfrom the side of her mouth.\n\"Don't you know\n  <i>\n   nothin'\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Arma\n  </i>\n  gon,\" Dawes corrected.\nHe looked sheepishly at\nthe stranger. \"Don't expect\nMister\u2014\" He cocked an eyebrow.\n\"What's the name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Becker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't expect Mr. Becker\nknows anything about Armagon.\nIt's just a dream, you\nknow.\" He smiled apologetically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dream? You mean this\u2014Armagon\nis a place you dream\nabout?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yep,\" Dawes said. He lifted\ncup to lip. \"Great coffee,\nMa.\" He leaned back with a\ncontented sigh. \"Dream about\nit every night. Got so used to\nthe place, I get all confused\nin the daytime.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mom said: \"I get muddle-headed\ntoo, sometimes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean\u2014\" Sol put his\nnapkin in his lap. \"You mean\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  dream about the same\nplace?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" Sally piped. \"We\nall go there at night. I'm goin'\nto the palace again, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you brush your teeth,\"\nMom said primly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If I brush my teeth. Boy,\nyou shoulda seen the exelution!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Execution,\" her father\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, my goodness!\" Mom\ngot up hastily. \"That reminds\nme. I gotta call poor Mrs.\nBrundage. It's the\n  <i>\n   least\n  </i>\n  I\ncould do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good idea,\" Dawes nodded.\n\"And I'll have to round\nup some folks and get old\nBrundage out of there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol was staring. He opened\nhis mouth, but couldn't think\nof the right question to ask.\nThen he blurted out: \"What\nexecution?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"None of\n  <i>\n   your\n  </i>\n  business,\"\nthe man said coldly. \"You eat\nup, young man. If you want\nme to get Sheriff Coogan\nlookin' for your car.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rest of the meal went\nsilently, except for Sally's insistence\nupon singing her\nschool song between mouthfuls.\nWhen Dawes was\nthrough, he pushed back his\nplate and ordered Sol to get\nready.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol grabbed his topcoat and\nfollowed the man out the\ndoor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have to stop someplace\nfirst,\" Dawes said. \"But we'll\nbe pickin' up the Sheriff on\nthe way. Okay with you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fine,\" Sol said uneasily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rain had stopped, but\nthe heavy clouds seemed reluctant\nto leave the skies over\nthe small town. There was a\nskittish breeze blowing, and\nSol Becker tightened the collar\nof his coat around his\nneck as he tried to keep up\nwith the fast-stepping Dawes.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  They\n  crossed the\nstreet diagonally, and entered\na two-story wooden building.\nDawes took the stairs at a\nbrisk pace, and pushed open\nthe door on the second floor.\nA fat man looked up from\nbehind a desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd\nsee if you wanted to help\nmove Brundage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man batted his eyes.\n\"Oh, Brundage!\" he said.\n\"You know, I clean forgot\nabout him?\" He laughed.\n\"Imagine me forgetting\nthat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah.\" Dawes wasn't\namused. \"And you Prince Regent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aw, Willie\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, come on.

He's just too\ndern fat to do much more'n\nsit on a throne and eat grapes.\nThat right, Charlie?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fat man giggled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here's the Sheriff,\" Dawes\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed\ncitizen with a long, sad face,\nwas rocking on a porch as\nthey approached his house,\ntrying to puff a half-lit pipe.\nHe lifted one hand wearily\nwhen he saw them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi, Cookie,\" Dawes\ngrinned. \"Thought you, me,\nand Charlie would get Brundage's\nbody outa the house.\nThis here's Mr. Becker; he\ngot another problem. Mr.\nBecker, meet Cookie Coogan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Sheriff joined the procession,\npausing only once to\ninquire into Sol's predicament.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He described the hitchhiker\nincident, but Coogan\nlistened stoically. He murmured\nsomething about the\nTroopers, and shuffled alongside\nthe puffing fat man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol soon realized that their\ndestination was a barber shop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dawes cupped his hands\nover the plate glass and\npeered inside. Gold letters on\nthe glass advertised: HAIRCUT\nSHAVE &amp; MASSAGE\nPARLOR. He reported: \"Nobody\nin the shop. Must be\nupstairs.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  The\n  fat man rang the\nbell. It was a while before an\nanswer came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a reedy woman in a\nhousecoat, her hair in curlers,\nher eyes red and swollen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, now,\" Dawes said\ngently. \"Don't you take on\nlike that, Mrs. Brundage. You\nheard the charges. It hadda\nbe this way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My poor Vincent,\" she\nsobbed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better let us up,\" the\nSheriff said kindly. \"No use\njust lettin' him lay there,\nMrs. Brundage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He didn't mean no harm,\"\nthe woman snuffled. \"He was\njust purely ornery, Vincent\nwas. Just plain mean stubborn.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The law's the law,\" the\nfat man sighed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol couldn't hold himself\nin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What law? Who's dead?\nHow did it happen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dawes looked at him disgustedly.\n\"Now is it any of\n  <i>\n   your\n  </i>\n  business? I mean, is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know,\" Sol said\nmiserably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You better stay out of\nthis,\" the Sheriff warned.\n\"This is a local matter, young\nman. You better stay in the\nshop while we go up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They filed past him and the\ncrying Mrs. Brundage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they were out of\nsight, Sol pleaded with her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened? How did\nyour husband die?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must tell me! Was it\nsomething to do with Armagon?\nDo you dream about the\nplace, too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was shocked at the\nquestion. \"Of course!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And your husband? Did\nhe have the same dream?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't\nyou leave me alone?\" She\nturned her back. \"I got things\nto do. You can make yourself\ncomfortable\u2014\" She indicated\nthe barber chairs, and left\nthrough the back door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol looked after her, and\nthen ambled over to the first\nchair and slipped into the\nhigh seat. His reflection in\nthe mirror, strangely gray in\nthe dim light, made him\ngroan. His clothes were a\nmess, and he needed a shave.\nIf only Brundage had been\nalive ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  He leaped out of the chair\nas voices sounded behind the\ndoor. Dawes was kicking it\nopen with his foot, his arms\nladen with two rather large\nfeet, still encased in bedroom\nslippers. Charlie was at the\nother end of the burden,\nwhich appeared to be a middle-aged\nman in pajamas. The\nSheriff followed the trio up\nwith a sad, undertaker expression.\nBehind him came Mrs.\nBrundage, properly weeping.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll take him to the funeral\nparlor,\" Dawes said,\nbreathing hard. \"Weighs a\nton, don't he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What killed him?\" Sol\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heart attack.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fat man chuckled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tableau was grisly. Sol\nlooked away, towards the\ncomfortingly mundane atmosphere\nof the barber shop. But\neven the sight of the thick-padded\nchairs, the shaving\nmugs on the wall, the neat\nrows of cutting instruments,\nseemed grotesque and morbid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they\nwent through the doorway.\n\"About my car\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Sheriff turned and regarded\nhim lugubriously.\n\"Your\n  <i>\n   car\n  </i>\n  ? Young man, ain't\nyou got no\n  <i>\n   respect\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol swallowed hard and fell\nsilent. He went outside with\nthem, the woman slamming\nthe barber-shop door behind\nhim. He waited in front of\nthe building while the men\ntoted away the corpse to some\nnew destination.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  He\n  took a walk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The town was just coming\nto life. People were strolling\nout of their houses, commenting\non the weather, chuckling\namiably about local affairs.\nKids on bicycles were beginning\nto appear, jangling the\nlittle bells and hooting to\neach other. A woman, hanging\nwash in the back yard,\ncalled out to him, thinking\nhe was somebody else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He found a little park, no\nmore than twenty yards in\ncircumference, centered\naround a weatherbeaten monument\nof some unrecognizable\nmilitary figure. Three\nold men took their places on\nthe bench that circled the\nGeneral, and leaned on their\ncanes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol was a civil engineer.\nBut he made like a reporter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pardon me, sir.\" The old\nman, leathery-faced, with a\nfine yellow moustache, looked\nat him dumbly. \"Have you\never heard of Armagon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You a stranger?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thought so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol repeated the question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Course I did. Been goin'\nthere ever since I was a kid.\nNight-times, that is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How\u2014I mean, what kind\nof place is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Said you're a stranger?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then 'tain't your business.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left the park, and wandered\ninto a thriving luncheonette.\nHe tried questioning\nthe man behind the counter,\nwho merely snickered and\nsaid: \"You stayin' with the\nDawes, ain't you? Better ask\nWillie, then. He knows the\nplace better than anybody.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He asked about the execution,\nand the man stiffened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't think I can talk\nabout that. Fella broke one of\nthe Laws; that's about it.\nDon't see where you come\ninto it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At eleven o'clock, he returned\nto the Dawes residence,\nand found Mom in the\nkitchen, surrounded by the\nwarm nostalgic odor of home-baked\nbread. She told him\nthat her husband had left a\nmessage for the stranger, informing\nhim that the State\nPolice would be around to get\nhis story.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waited in the house,\ngloomily turning the pages of\nthe local newspaper, searching\nfor references to Armagon.\nHe found nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced\nState Trooper came to\ncall, and Sol told his story.\nHe was promised nothing,\nand told to stay in town until\nhe was contacted again by\nthe authorities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mom fixed him a light\nlunch, the greatest feature of\nwhich was some hot biscuits\nshe plucked out of the oven.\nIt made him feel almost normal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wandered around the\ntown some more after lunch,\ntrying to spark conversation\nwith the residents.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He learned little.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  At\n  five-thirty, he returned\nto the Dawes house, and was\npromptly leaped upon by\nlittle Sally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" she said,\nclutching his right leg and\nalmost toppling him over.\n\"We had a party in school. I\nhad chocolate cake. You goin'\nto stay with us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just another night,\" Sol\ntold her, trying to shake the\ngirl off. \"If it's okay with\nyour folks. They haven't\nfound my car yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sally!\" Mom was peering\nout of the screen door. \"You\nlet Mr. Becker alone and go\nwash. Your Pa will be home\nsoon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, pooh,\" the girl said,\nher pigtails swinging. \"Do\nyou got a girlfriend, mister?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\" Sol struggled towards\nthe house with her\ndead weight on his leg.\n\"Would you mind? I can't\nwalk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would you be my boyfriend?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, we'll talk about it.\nIf you let go my leg.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inside the house, she said:\n\"We're having pot roast. You\nstayin'?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course Mr. Becker's\nstayin',\" Mom said. \"He's our\nguest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's very kind of you,\"\nSol said. \"I really wish you'd\nlet me pay something\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't want to hear another\nword about pay.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Mr. Dawes\n  came home an\nhour later, looking tired.\nMom pecked him lightly on\nthe forehead. He glanced at\nthe evening paper, and then\nspoke to Sol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hear you been asking\nquestions, Mr. Becker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol nodded, embarrassed.\n\"Guess I have. I'm awfully\ncurious about this Armagon\nplace. Never heard of anything\nlike it before.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dawes grunted. \"You ain't\na reporter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I\nwas just satisfying my own\ncuriosity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh-huh.\" Dawes looked\nreflective. \"You wouldn't be\nthinkin' about writing us up\nor anything. I mean, this is a\npretty private affair.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Writing it up?\" Sol\nblinked. \"I hadn't thought of\nit. But you'll have to admit\u2014it's\nsure interesting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" Dawes said narrowly.\n\"I guess it would be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Supper!\" Mom called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After the meal, they spent\na quiet evening at home. Sally\nwent to bed, screaming her\nreluctance, at eight-thirty.\nMom, dozing in the big chair\nnear the fireplace, padded upstairs\nat nine. Then Dawes\nyawned widely, stood up, and\nsaid goodnight at quarter-of-ten.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He paused in the doorway\nbefore leaving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd think about that,\" he\nsaid. \"Writing it up, I mean.\nA lot of folks would think\nyou were just plum crazy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol laughed feebly. \"I\nguess they would at that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Goodnight,\" Dawes said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Goodnight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He read Sally's copy of\n  <i>\n   Treasure Island\n  </i>\n  for about\nhalf an hour. Then he undressed,\nmade himself comfortable\non the sofa, snuggled\nunder the soft blanket\nthat Mom had provided, and\nshut his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reviewed the events of\nthe day before dropping off\nto sleep. The troublesome\nSally. The strange dream\nworld of Armagon. The visit\nto the barber shop. The removal\nof Brundage's body.\nThe conversations with the\ntownspeople. Dawes' suspicious\nattitude ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then sleep came.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  He\n  was flanked by marble\npillars, thrusting towards\na high-domed ceiling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The room stretched long\nand wide before him, the\nwalls bedecked in stunning\npurple draperies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He whirled at the sound of\nfootsteps, echoing stridently\non the stone floor. Someone\nwas running towards him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Sally, pigtails\nstreaming out behind her, the\nsmall body wearing a flowing\nwhite toga. She was shrieking,\nlaughing as she skittered\npast him, clutching a gleaming\ngold helmet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He called out to her, but\nshe was too busy outdistancing\nher pursuer. It was Sheriff\nCoogan, puffing and huffing,\nthe metal-and-gold cloth\nuniform ludicrous on his\nlanky frame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed.\n\"Gimme my hat!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mom was following him,\nher stout body regal in scarlet\nrobes. \"Sally! You give\nSir Coogan his helmet! You\nhear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, Mr. Becker! How\nnice to see you again! Pa!\n  <i>\n   Pa!\n  </i>\n  Look who's here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Willie Dawes appeared.\n  <i>\n   No!\n  </i>\n  Sol thought. This was\n  <i>\n   King\n  </i>\n  Dawes; nothing else\ncould explain the magnificence\nof his attire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Dawes said craftily.\n\"So I see. Welcome to Armagon,\nMr. Becker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Armagon?\" Sol gaped.\n\"Then this is the place\nyou've been dreaming about?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yep,\" the King said. \"And\nnow\n  <i>\n   you're\n  </i>\n  in it, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then I'm only dreaming!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie, the fat man,\nclumsy as ever in his robes of\nState, said: \"So\n  <i>\n   that's\n  </i>\n  the\nsnooper, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yep,\" Dawes chuckled.\n\"Think you better round up\nthe Knights.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sol said: \"The Knights?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Exelution! Exelution!\"\nSally shrieked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now wait a minute\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie shouted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Running feet, clanking of\narmor. Sol backed up against\na pillar. \"Now look here.\nYou've gone far enough\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not quite,\" said the King.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Knights stepped forward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait!\" Sol screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Familiar faces, under shining\nhelmets, moved towards\nhim; the tips of sharp-pointed\nspears gleaming wickedly.\nAnd Sol Becker wondered\u2014would\nhe ever awake?\n </p>\n <b>\n  Transcriber's Note:\n </b>\n This etext was produced from\n <i>\n  Fantastic Universe\n </i>\n January 1957.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

He asks what time it is, but Sally responds that she likes poached eggs. Sol desperately tries to get her to leave, but Mom sends her away. Sol tries to call Fred but is met with indifference; a man named Willie Dawes offers to take him to the sheriff as Mom finishes breakfast. They talk about Armagon during breakfast, which is a place that everybody dreams about at night. Sol asks about the execution again, but Dawes tells him to eat his breakfast. They enter a wooden building to meet Charlie, and Dawes mentions that they are picking up Sheriff Coogan too. As they discuss with the other people, Sol realizes that everybody dreams about Armagon.

Late at night, he picked up a hitchhiker who minutes later pushed Sol out of the car and drove away, leaving the man soaking near an unknown village. He knocked at the door of a village house, and a woman - he called her Mom - let him in. Sol briefly told her what had happened, and she allowed him to sleep on the couch. Anxiously whispering that she would miss some execution, Mom went upstairs, leaving Sol confused but grateful. He got woken up by a little girl named Sally, pestering him with awkward questions - Mom told her to stop and get ready for breakfast. Minutes later, he found a telephone and called Fred, who didn\u2019t seem very upset by the news of Sol probably missing the wedding. After hanging up the phone, Sol talked to a man called Dawes, who promised to take him to Sheriff Coogan to report the car theft after breakfast. Mom called out that the breakfast was ready. Sally told Sol about Armagon - a place both parents and the daughter dreamt about every night. She also started talking about some execution, but Dawes coldly refused to answer Sol\u2019s questions about this. Before meeting the sheriff, Sol and Dawes crossed the street and picked up a man named Charlie or, as Dawes said, Prince Regent. As they were marching down the street, they met a woman who, Sol eventually realized, was also dreaming about Armagon. They finally came to the sheriff\u2019s house. He listened to Sol\u2019s story while they all were walking to a barbershop to pick up the body of a man called Brundage. They saw a crying woman - the wife of the dead, and Sol again made an attempt to understand who got killed and why. Soon, they came back with the body and told Sol to wait while they were carrying it somewhere else. Sol took a walk and again tried to ask citizens about the mystery place from their dreams but didn\u2019t get much information. He then went back to the Dawes residence. A State Trooper asked him some questions about the car and told him to remain in town until further notice. Sol ate lunch, walked for a bit, and returned in the evening. Sally - the daughter - clutched his leg and then started telling him about her day. Mr.Dawes came later and asked Sol about his questions to the citizens and then wondered if the man was a reporter. After a quiet evening, they all went to bed. Sol fell asleep and suddenly realized he was somewhere else, surrounded by marble pillars. He saw Sally running around in a white toga, then the sheriff chasing her. He finally saw Dawes dressed as a king who welcomed Becker to Armagon. The king unexpectedly asked Charlie to round up the knights, and Sally started triumphantly screaming: \u201cExecution!\u201d. Sol asked them to stop, but the knights kept approaching.

NOURSE\n </p>\n <p>\n  Illustrated by SCHOENHEER\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1957.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  <i>\n   Being two men rolled out of one would solve\n   <br/>\n   my problems\u2014but which one would I be?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  I suppose that every guy reaches a point once in his lifetime when he\ngets one hundred and forty per cent fed up with his wife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Understand now\u2014I've got nothing against marriage or any thing\nlike that. Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded American\nInstitution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throw\na cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a woman\nlike Marge\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's so\n  <i>\n   permanent\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in the\nBlissful 'Fifties\u2014but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968,\nand all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women got\ntheir teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved Spouse\nCompensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life if\nI'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a man\nhas to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keep\nMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes\nand a shape that could set your teeth chattering\u2014but that was where\nthe dream stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long\nenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she was\ncrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chilling\ndetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,\nwhich happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a \"beastly\nheadache\" (for which I was personally responsible) and the other half\nshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time we\ngot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Maybe we just weren't meant for each other. I don't know. I used to\nenvy guys like Harry Folsom at the office. His wife is no joy to live\nwith either, but at least he could take a spin down to Rio once in a\nwhile with one of the stenographers and get away with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knew better than to try. Marge was already so jealous that I couldn't\neven smile at the company receptionist without a twinge of guilt. Give\nMarge something real to howl about, and I'd be ready for the Rehab\nCenter in a week.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I'd underestimated Marge. She didn't need anything real, as I found\nout when Jeree came along.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Business was booming and the secretaries at the office got shuffled\naround from time to time. Since I had an executive-type job, I got an\nexecutive-type secretary. Her name was Jeree and she was gorgeous. As\na matter of fact, she was better than gorgeous. She was the sort of\nsecretary every businessman ought to have in his office. Not to do any\nwork\u2014just to sit there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeree was tall and dark, and she could convey more without saying\nanything than I ever dreamed was possible. The first day she was\nthere, she conveyed to me very clearly that if I cared to supply the\nopportunity, she'd be glad to supply the motive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That night, I could tell that Marge had been thinking something over\nduring the day. She let me get the first bite of dinner halfway to my\nmouth, and then she said, \"I hear you got a new secretary today.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I muttered something into my coffee cup and pretended not to hear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marge turned on her Accusing Look #7. \"I also hear that she's\nfive-foot-eight and tapes out at 38-25-36 and thinks you're handsome.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marge had quite a spy system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She couldn't be much of a secretary,\" she added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's a perfectly good secretary,\" I blurted, and kicked myself\nmentally. I should have known Marge's traps by then.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marge exploded. I didn't get any supper, and she was still going strong\nat midnight. I tried to argue, but when Marge got going, there was no\nstopping her. I had my ultimatum, as far as Jeree was concerned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry Folsom administered the\n  <i>\n   coup de grace\n  </i>\n  at coffee next morning.\n\"What you need is an Ego Prime,\" he said with a grin. \"Solve all your\nproblems. I hear they work like a charm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I set my coffee cup down. Bells were ringing in my ears. \"Don't be\nridiculous. It's against the law. Anyway, I wouldn't think of such a\nthing. It's\u2014it's indecent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry shrugged. \"Just joking, old man, just joking. Still, it's fun to\nthink about, eh? Freedom from wife. Absolutely safe and harmless. Not\neven too expensive, if you've got the right contacts. And I've got a\nfriend who knows a guy\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just then, Jeree walked past us and flashed me a big smile. I gripped\nmy cup for dear life and still spilled coffee on my tie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I said, a guy gets fed up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And maybe opportunity would only knock once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And an Ego Prime would solve all my problems, as Harry had told me.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was completely illegal, of course. The wonder was that Ego Prime,\nInc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the\nnation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the\nuse of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license\nfor a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a\nhigh public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even\nthen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to\nhave a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance\nexactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how,\nwhy, and under what circumstances.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The law didn't leave a man much leeway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But everybody knew that if you\n  <i>\n   really\n  </i>\n  wanted a personal Prime with\nall his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black\nmarket prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be\ndone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got\nlost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with\na black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse\noff lower Broadway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah, yes,\" the little man said. \"Mr. Faircloth. We've been expecting\nyou.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I didn't like the looks of the guy any more than the looks of the\nplace. \"I've been told you can supply me with a\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He coughed. \"Yes, yes. I understand. It might be possible.\" He fingered\nhis mustache and regarded me from pouchy eyes. \"Busy executives often\ncome to us to avoid the\u2014ah\u2014unpleasantness of formal arrangements.\nNaturally, we only act as agents, you might say. We never see the\nmerchandise ourselves\u2014\" He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"Now were\nyou interested in the ordinary Utility model, Mr. Faircloth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I assumed he was just being polite. You didn't come to the back door\nfor Utility models.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very careful\nworkmanship. Only a few key Paralyzers in operation and practically\ncomplete circuit duplication. Very useful for\u2014ah\u2014close contact work,\nyou know. Social engagements, conferences\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was shaking my head. \"I want a\n  <i>\n   Super\n  </i>\n  Deluxe model,\" I told him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned and winked. \"Ah, indeed! You want perfect duplication.\nYes, indeed. Domestic situations can be\u2014awkward, shall we say. Very\nawkward\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gave him a cold stare. I couldn't see where my domestic problems were\nany affairs of his. He got the idea and hurried me back to a storeroom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement. You'll go to our\nlaboratory on 14th Street to have the minute impressions taken. But I\ncan assure you you'll be delighted, simply delighted.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The blanks weren't very impressive\u2014clay and putty and steel, faceless,\nbrainless. He went over me like a tailor, checking measurements of all\nsorts. He was thorough\u2014embarrassingly thorough, in fact\u2014but finally\nhe was finished. I went on to the laboratory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And that was all there was to it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Practical androids had been a pipe dream until Hunyadi invented the\nNeuro-pantograph. Hunyadi had no idea in the world what to do with it\nonce he'd invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers bought\nhim body and soul, sub-contracted the problems of anatomy, design,\nartistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with\nthe modern Ego Primes we have today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked\noutside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it pretty\nwoozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in the\nrecovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Prime\nwhen I got him. Finally the door opened and the head technician walked\nin, followed by a tall, sandy-haired man with worried blue eyes and a\ntired look on his face.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Meet George Faircloth Prime,\" the technician said, grinning at me like\na nursing mother.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shook hands with myself. Good firm handshake, I thought admiringly.\nNothing flabby about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I slapped George Prime on the shoulder happily. \"Come on, Brother,\" I\nsaid. \"You've got a job to do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, secretly, I was wondering what Jeree was doing that night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime had remote controls, as well as a completely recorded\nneurological analogue of his boss, who was me. George Prime thought\nwhat I thought about the same things I did in the same way I did. The\nonly difference was that what I told George Prime to do, George Prime\ndid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I told him to go to a business conference in San Francisco and make\nthe smallest possible concessions for the largest possible orders,\nhe would go there and do precisely that. His signature would be my\nsignature. It would hold up in court.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if I told him that my wife Marge was really a sweet, good-hearted\ngirl and that he was to stay home and keep her quiet and happy any time\nI chose, he'd do that, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime was a duplicate of me right down to the sandy hairs on\nthe back of my hands. Our fingerprints were the same. We had the same\nmannerisms and used the same figures of speech. The only physical\ndifference apparent even to an expert was the tiny finger-depression\nburied in the hair above his ear. A little pressure there would stop\nGeorge Prime dead in his tracks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was so lifelike, even I kept forgetting that he was basically just a\npile of gears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd planned very carefully how I meant to use him, of course.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every man who's been married eight years has a sanctuary. He builds it\nup and maintains it against assault in the very teeth of his wife's\nnatural instinct to clean, poke, pry and rearrange things. Sometimes\nit takes him years of diligent work to establish his hideout and be\nconfident that it will stay inviolate, but if he starts early enough,\nand sticks with it long enough, and is fierce enough and persistent\nenough and crafty enough, he'll probably win in the end. The girls hate\nhim for it, but he'll win.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With some men, it's just a box on their dressers, or a desk, or a\ncorner of an unused back room. But I had set my sights high early in\nthe game. With me, it was the whole workshop in the garage.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At first, Marge tried open warfare. She had to clean the place up, she\nsaid. I told her I didn't\n  <i>\n   want\n  </i>\n  her to clean it up. She could clean\nthe whole house as often as she chose, but\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  would clean up the\nworkshop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a couple of sharp engagements on that field, Marge staged a\nstrategic withdrawal and reorganized her attack. A little pile of wood\nshavings would be on the workshop floor one night and be gone the next.\nA wrench would be back on the rack\u2014upside down, of course. An open\npaint can would have a cover on it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I always knew. I screamed loudly and bitterly. I ranted and raved. I\nswore I'd rig up a booby-trap with a shotgun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So she quit trying to clean in there and just went in once in a while\nto take a look around. I fixed that with the old toothpick-in-the-door\nroutine. Every time she so much as set foot in that workshop, she had a\nbattle on her hands for the next week or so. She could count on it. It\nwas that predictable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She never found out how I knew, and after seven years or so, it wore\nher down. She didn't go into the workshop any more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I said, you've got to be persistent, but you'll win.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eventually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you're\n  <i>\n   really\n  </i>\n  persistent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now all my effort paid off. I got Marge out of the house for an hour\nor two that day and had George Prime delivered and stored in the big\ncloset in the workshop. They hooked his controls up and left me a\nmanual of instructions for running him. When I got home that night,\nthere he was, just waiting to be put to work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After supper, I went out to the workshop\u2014to get the pipe I'd left\nthere, I said. I pushed George Prime's button, winked at him and\nswitched on the free-behavior circuits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go to it, Brother,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime put my pipe in his mouth, lit it and walked back into the\nhouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later, I heard them fighting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It sounded so familiar that I laughed out loud. Then I caught a cab on\nthe corner and headed uptown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had quite a night, Jeree and I. I got home just about time to start\nfor work, and sure enough, there was George Prime starting my car,\nbusiness suit on, briefcase under his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pushed the recall and George Prime got out of the car and walked into\nthe workshop. He stepped into his cradle in the closet. I turned him\noff and then drove away in the car.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bless his metallic soul, he'd even kissed Marge good-by for me!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Needless to say, the affairs of George Faircloth took on a new sparkle\nwith George Prime on hand to cover the home front.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the first week, I was hardly home at all. I must say I felt a\nlittle guilty, leaving poor old George Prime to cope with Marge all\nthe time\u2014he looked and acted so human, it was easy to forget that\nhe literally couldn't care less. But I felt apologetic all the same\nwhenever I took him out of his closet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's really a sweet girl underneath it all,\" I'd say. \"You'll learn\nto like her after a bit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course I like her,\" George Prime said. \"You told me to, didn't you?\nStop worrying. She's really a sweet girl underneath it all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sounded convincing enough, but still it bothered me. \"You're sure\nyou understand the exchange mechanism?\" I asked. I didn't want any\nfoul-ups there, as you can imagine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perfectly,\" said George Prime. \"When you buzz the recall, I wait for\nthe first logical opportunity I can find to come out to the workshop,\nand you take over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you might get nervous. You might inadvertently tip her off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime looked pained. \"Really, old man! I'm a Super Deluxe model,\nremember? I don't have fourteen activated Hunyadi tubes up in this\ncranial vault of mine just for nothing. You're the one that's nervous.\nI'll take care of everything. Relax.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeree made good all her tacit promises and then some. She had a very\ncozy little apartment on 34th Street where we went to relax after\na hard day at the office. When we weren't doing the town, that is.\nAs long as Jeree didn't try too much conversation, everything was\nwonderful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then, when Jeree got a little boring, there was Sybil in the\naccounting department. Or Dorothy in promotion. Or Jane. Or Ingrid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could go on at some length, but I won't. I was building quite a\nreputation for myself around the office.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, it was like buying your first 3-V set. In a week or so, the\nnovelty wears off a little and you start eating on schedule again. It\ntook a little while, but I finally had things down to a reasonable\nprogram.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tuesday and Thursday nights, I was informally \"out\" while formally\n\"in.\" Sometimes I took Sunday nights \"out\" if things got too sticky\naround the house over the weekend. The rest of the time, George Prime\ncooled his heels in his closet. Locked up, of course. Can't completely\ntrust a wife to observe a taboo, no matter how well trained she is.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There, was an irreconcilable amount of risk. George Prime had to\nquick-step some questions about my work at the office\u2014there was no\nway to supply him with current data until the time for his regular\ntwo-month refill and pattern-accommodation at the laboratory. In the\nmeantime, George Prime had to make do with what he had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But as he himself pointed out he was a Super Deluxe model.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Marge didn't suspect a thing. In fact, George Prime seemed to be having\na remarkable effect on her. I didn't notice anything at first\u2014I was\nhardly ever home. But one night I found my pipe and slippers laid out\nfor me, and the evening paper neatly folded on my chair, and it brought\nme up short. Marge had been extremely docile lately. We hadn't had a\ngood fight in days. Weeks, come to think of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought it over and shrugged. Old age, I figured. She was bound to\nmellow sometime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But pretty soon I began to wonder if she wasn't mellowing a little too\nmuch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One night when I got home, she kissed me almost as though she really\nmeant it. There wasn't an unpleasant word all through dinner, which\nhappened to be steak with mushrooms, served in the dining room (!) by\ncandlelight (!!) with dinner music that Marge could never bear, chiefly\nbecause I liked it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We sat over coffee and cigarettes, and it seemed almost like old\ntimes.\n  <i>\n   Very\n  </i>\n  old times, in fact I even caught myself looking at Marge\nagain\u2014really\n  <i>\n   looking\n  </i>\n  at her, watching the light catch in her hair,\nalmost admiring the sparkle in her brown eyes. Sparkle, I said, not\nglint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I mentioned before, Marge was always easy to look at. That night,\nshe was practically ravishing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you doing to her?\" I asked George Prime later, out in the\nworkshop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, nothing,\" said George Prime, looking innocent. He couldn't fool\nme with his look, though, because it was exactly the look I use when\nI'm guilty and pretending to be innocent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There must be\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime shrugged. \"Any woman will warm up if you spend enough time\ntelling her all the things she wants to hear and pay all the attention\nto her that she wants paid to her. That's elemental psychology. I can\ngive you page references.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ought to mention that George Prime had a complete set of basic texts\nrun into his circuits, at a slightly additional charge. Never can tell\nwhen an odd bit of information will come in useful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, you must be doing quite a job,\" I said.\n  <i>\n   I'd\n  </i>\n  never managed to\nwarm Marge up much.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I try,\" said George Prime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" I hastened to add, forgetting that a Prime's\nfeelings can't be hurt and that he was only acting like me because it\nwas in character. \"I was just curious.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course, George.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm really delighted that you're doing so well.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thank you, George.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the next night when I was with Dawn, who happens to be a gorgeous\nredhead who could put Marge to shame on practically any field of battle\nexcept maybe brains, I kept thinking about Marge all evening long, and\nwondering if things weren't getting just a little out of hand.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The next evening I almost tripped over George Prime coming out of a\nliquor store. I ducked quickly into an alley and flagged him. \"\n  <i>\n   What\nare you doing out on the street?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gave me my martyred look. \"Just buying some bourbon. You were out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you're not supposed to be off the premises\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Marge asked me to come. I couldn't tell her I was sorry, but her\nhusband wouldn't let me, could I?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, certainly not\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You want me to keep her happy, don't you? You don't want her to get\nsuspicious.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, but suppose somebody saw us together! If she ever got a hint\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" George Prime said contritely. \"It seemed the right thing\nto do.\n  <i>\n   You\n  </i>\n  would have done it. At least that's what my judgment\ncenter maintained. We had quite an argument.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, tell your judgment center to use a little sense,\" I snapped. \"I\ndon't want it to happen again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next night, I stayed home, even though it was Tuesday night. I was\nbeginning to get worried. Of course, I did have complete control\u2014I\ncould snap George Prime off any time I wanted, or even take him in for\na complete recircuiting\u2014but it seemed a pity. He was doing such a nice\njob.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marge was docile as a kitten, even more so than before. She sympathized\nwith my hard day at the office and agreed heartily that the boss,\ndespite all appearances, was in reality a jabbering idiot. After\ndinner, I suggested a movie, but Marge gave me an odd sort of look and\nsaid she thought it would be much nicer to spend the evening at home by\nthe fire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd just gotten settled with the paper when she came into the living\nroom and sat down beside me. She was wearing some sort of filmy affair\nI'd never laid eyes on before, and I caught a whiff of my favorite\nperfume.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Georgie?\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you still love me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I set the paper down and stared at her. \"How's that? Of course I\nstill\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, sometimes you don't act much like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mm. I guess I've\u2014uh\u2014got an awful headache tonight.\" Damn that\nperfume!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh,\" said Marge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In fact, I thought I'd turn in early and get some sleep\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sleep,\" said Marge. There was no mistaking the disappointment in her\nvoice. Now I knew that things were out of hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next evening, I activated George Prime and caught the taxi at the\ncorner, but I called Ruby and broke my date with her. I took in an\nearly movie alone and was back by ten o'clock. I left the cab at the\ncorner and walked quietly up the path toward the garage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I stopped. I could see Marge and George Prime through the living\nroom windows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime was kissing my wife the way I hadn't kissed her in eight\nlong years. It made my hair stand on end. And Marge wasn't exactly\nfighting him off, either. She was coming back for more. After a little,\nthe lights went off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime was a Super Deluxe model, all right.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I dashed into the workshop and punched the recall button as hard as I\ncould, swearing under my breath. How long had this been going on? I\npunched the button again, viciously, and waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  George Prime didn't come out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was plenty cold out in the workshop that night and I didn't sleep\na wink. About dawn, out came George Prime, looking like a man with a\nfour-day hangover.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our conversation got down to fundamentals. George Prime kept insisting\nblandly that, according to my own directions, he was to pick the first\nlogical opportunity to come out when I buzzed, and that was exactly\nwhat he'd done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was furious all the way to work.

No Prime in his\nright circuits would behave this way without some human guidance and\nthat meant only one thing: Marge had spotted him. It had happened\nbefore.

The story revolves around a couple, George Faircloth and Marge Faircloth, trapped in an eight year long unhappy marriage. Marge complains, whines and cries too much for George. Equally, George does not fulfill his potential in being a good, supportive husband either. After trying to fix it in every way possible, George is hopeless and gives in to the idea of getting an \u201cEgo Prime,\u201d a android clone of him that would look and act like him, allowing him to lead a joyful parallel life as the android directly deals with his wife.\n\nFirst, the story gives a social commentary on the concept of marriage. With the couple being trapped in such a long unhappy marriage, even after trying to fix it yet not finding any way out of it, the story showcases the unnatural aspect of marriage as a social construct. Two individuals are bound to live life together but yet are not able to get out of it because of an imaginary societal contract they agreed upon and societal norms that would view such action as dishonorable. Instead of finding other ways other than a divorce, which they could not afford, to fix it, they thus put up with living together unhappily. This leaves the reader questioning whether marriage should truly limit two individuals\u2019 freedom to this extent.\n\nThe story also gives a commentary on the nature of a good marriage. As the story goes on, George\u2019s Ego Prime starts to turn Marge into a softer, nicer woman, who George starts to appreciate more. George Prime gives credit to this change in behavior to his choice of saying the right things, in other words, the things Marge wants to hear. Equally, when George finds out the Marge he has been falling for again is merely a Prime too, he still accepts and wants her as she makes him feel appreciated. These intentions make the readers question the selfishness behind the concept of marriage. Do we agree to a marital contract purely for our own selfishness of wanting to be serviced and on some level, praised?

DE VET\n </p>\n <p>\n  Illustrated by TURPIN\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1957.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Kaiser stared at the tape in his hand for a long uncomprehending\nminute. How long had the stuff been coming through in this inane baby\ntalk? And why hadn't he noticed it before? Why had he had to read this\nlast communication a third time before he recognized anything unusual\nabout it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went over the words again, as though maybe this time they'd read as\nthey should.\n </p>\n <p>\n  OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS BETTER,\nLET USNS KNOW.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape\nthoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large\ndrops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout\nship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn this climate!\" Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. \"Doesn't it ever do\nanything here except rain?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And\nwhy was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been\ndoing during that time?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture\nfrom his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out\nwhen the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he\nwas stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the\njob very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle\nalone\u2014or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or\nno chance of his being able to find either here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and\nbrought them out where he could look at them:\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mother ship,\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  , had been on the last leg of its\nplanet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout\nship\u2014the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the\nexploring of new worlds\u2014and set itself into a giant orbit about this\nplanet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means\nof slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop.\nIts limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an\norbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle\na pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here\nforever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand. Baby talk....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  One thing he could find out: how long this had been going on. He\nturned to the communicator and unhooked the paper receptacle on its\nbottom. It held about a yard and a half of tape, probably his last\nseveral messages\u2014both those sent and those received. He pulled it out\nimpatiently and began reading.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first was from himself:\n </p>\n <p>\n  YOUR SUGGESTIONS NO HELP. HOW AM I GOING TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO SCOUT\nWITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT? AND WHERE DO I GET IT? DO YOU THINK I FOUND\nA TOOL SHOP DOWN HERE? FOR GOD'S SAKE, COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER.\n </p>\n <p>\n  VISITED SEAL-PEOPLE AGAIN TODAY. STILL HAVE THEIR STINK IN MY NOSE.\nFOUND HUTS ALONG RIVER BANK, SO I GUESS THEY DON'T LIVE IN WATER.\nBUT THEY DO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME THERE. NO, I HAVE NO WAY OF\nESTIMATING THEIR INTELLIGENCE. I WOULD JUDGE IT AVERAGES NO HIGHER\nTHAN SEVEN-YEAR-OLD HUMAN. THEY DEFINITELY DO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER.\nWILL TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEM, BUT YOU GET TO WORK FAST ON HOW\nI REPAIR SCOUT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SWELLING IN ARM WORSE AND AM DEVELOPING A FEVER. TEMPERATURE 102.7 AN\nHOUR AGO.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SMOKY\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship must have answered immediately, for the return message time\nwas six hours later than his own, the minimum interval necessary for\ntwo-way exchange.\n </p>\n <p>\n  DOING OUR BEST, SMOKY. YOUR IMMEDIATE PROBLEM, AS WE SEE IT, IS TO\nKEEP WELL. WE FED ALL THE INFORMATION YOU GAVE US INTO SAM, BUT YOU\nDIDN'T HAVE MUCH EXCEPT THE STING IN YOUR ARM. AS EXPECTED, ALL THAT\nCAME OUT WAS \"DATA INSUFFICIENT.\" TRY TO GIVE US MORE. ALSO DETAIL\nALL SYMPTOMS SINCE YOUR LAST REPORT. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE DOING\nEVERYTHING WE CAN AT THIS END. GOOD LUCK.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sam, Kaiser knew, was the ship's mechanical diagnostician. His report\nfollowed:\n </p>\n <p>\n  ARM SWOLLEN. UNABLE TO KEEP DOWN FOOD LAST TWELVE HOURS. ABOUT TWO\nHOURS AGO, ENTIRE BODY TURNED LIVID RED. BRIEF PERIODS OF BLANKNESS.\nTHINGS KEEP COMING AND GOING. SICK AS HELL. HURRY.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SMOKY\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship's next message read:\n </p>\n <p>\n  INFECTION QUITE DEFINITE. BUT SOMETHING STRANGE THERE. GIVE US\nANYTHING MORE YOU HAVE.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  His own reply perplexed Kaiser:\n </p>\n <p>\n  LAST LETTER FUNNY. I NOT UNDERSTAND. WHY IS OO SENDING GARBLE TALK?\nDID USNS MAKE UP SECRET MESSAGES?\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SMOKY\n </p>\n <p>\n  The expedition, apparently, was as puzzled as he:\n </p>\n <p>\n  WHAT'S THE MATTER, SMOKY? THAT LAST MESSAGE WAS IN PLAIN TERRAN. NO\nREASON WHY YOU COULDN'T READ IT. AND WHY THE BABY TALK? IF YOU'RE\nSPOOFING, STOP. GIVE US MORE SYMPTOMS. HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW?\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  The baby talk was worse on Kaiser's next:\n </p>\n <p>\n  TWAZY. WHAT FOR OO TENDING TWAZY LETTERS? FINK UM CAN WEAD TWAZY\nLETTERS? SKIN ALL YELLOW NOW. COLD. COLD. CO\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship's following communication was three hours late. It was the\nlast on the tape\u2014the one Kaiser had read earlier. Apparently they\ndecided to humor him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS BETTER,\nLET USNS KNOW.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was not much help. All it told him was that he had been sick.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt better now, outside of a muscular weariness, as though\nconvalescing from a long illness. He put the back of his hand to his\nforehead. Cool. No fever anyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glanced at the clock-calendar on the instrument board and back at\nthe date and time on the tape where he'd started his baby talk. Twenty\nhours. He hadn't been out of his head too long. He began punching the\ncommunicator keys while he nibbled at a biscuit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SEEM TO BE FULLY RECOVERED. FEELING FINE. ANYTHING NEW FROM SAM? AND\nHOW ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO SCOUT? GIVE ME ANYTHING YOU HAVE ON EITHER OR\nBOTH.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SMOKY\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser felt suddenly weary. He lay on the scout's bunk and tried\nto sleep. Soon he was in that phantasm land between sleep and\nwakefulness\u2014he knew he was not sleeping, yet he did dream.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the same dream he had had many times before. In it, he was back\nhome again, the home he had joined the space service to escape. He had\nrealized soon after his marriage that his wife, Helene, did not love\nhim. She had married him for the security his pay check provided. And\nthough it soon became evident that she, too, regretted her bargain,\nshe would not divorce him. Instead, she had her revenge on him by\npersistent nagging, by letting herself grow fat and querulous, and by\ncaring for their house only in a slovenly way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her crippled brother had moved in with them the day they were married.\nHis mind was as crippled as his body and he took an unhealthy delight\nin helping his sister torment Kaiser.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an\nhour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still\nfive more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck\nand shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of\nBig Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting\u2014or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They had stopped their play and eating as Kaiser approached and now\nmost of them swam in to shore and stood in the water, staring and\npiping. They varied in size from small seal-pups to full-grown adults.\nSome chewed on bunches of water weed, which they manipulated with their\nlips and drew into their mouths.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had mammalian characteristics, Kaiser had noted before, so it\nwas not difficult to distinguish the females from the males. The\nproportion was roughly fifty-fifty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Several of the bolder males climbed up beside Kaiser and began pawing\nhis plastic clothing. Kaiser stood still and tried to keep his\nbreathing shallow, for their odor was almost more than he could bear.\nOne native smeared Kaiser's face with an exploring paw and Kaiser\ngagged and pushed him roughly away. He was bound by regulations to\ndisplay no hostility to newly discovered natives, but he couldn't take\nmuch more of this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A young female splashed water on two young males who stood near and\nthey turned with shrill pipings and chased her into the water. The\nentire group seemed to lose interest in Kaiser and joined in the chase,\nor went back to other diversions of their own. Kaiser's inspectors\nfollowed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were a mindless lot, Kaiser observed. The river supplied them with\nan easy existence, with food and living space, and apparently they had\nfew natural enemies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser walked away, following the long slow bend of the river, and\ncame to a collection of perhaps two hundred dwellings built in three\nhaphazard rows along the river bank. He took time to study their\nconstruction more closely this time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were all round domes, little more than the height of a man, built\nof blocks that appeared to be mud, packed with river weed and sand. How\nthey were able to dry these to give them the necessary solidity, Kaiser\ndid not know. He had found no signs that they knew how to use fire, and\nall apparent evidence was against their having it. They then had to\nhave sunlight. Maybe it rained less during certain seasons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The domes' construction was based on a series of four arches built in a\ncircle. When the base covering the periphery had been laid, four others\nwere built on and between them, and continued in successive tiers until\nthe top was reached. Each tier thus furnished support for the next\nabove. No other framework was needed. The final tier formed the roof.\nThey made sound shelters, but Kaiser had peered into several and found\nthem dark and dank\u2014and as smelly as the natives themselves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The few loungers in the village paid little attention to Kaiser and\nhe wandered through the irregular streets until he became bored and\nreturned to the scout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  sent little that helped during the next twelve hours\nand Kaiser occupied his time trying again to repair the damage to the\nscout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The job appeared maddeningly simply. As the scout had glided in for\na soft landing, its metal bottom had ridden a concealed rock and bent\ninward. The bent metal had carried up with it the tube supplying the\nfuel pump and flattened it against the motor casing.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Opening the tube again would not have been difficult, but first it had\nto be freed from under the ship. Kaiser had tried forcing the sheet\nmetal back into place with a small crowbar\u2014the best leverage he had on\nhand\u2014but it resisted his best efforts. He still could think of no way\nto do the job, simple as it was, though he gave his concentration to it\nthe rest of the day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That evening, Kaiser received information from the\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  that\nwas at least definite:\n </p>\n <p>\n  SET YOURSELF FOR A SHOCK, SMOKY. SAM FINALLY CAME THROUGH. YOU WON'T\nLIKE WHAT YOU HEAR. AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST. BUT IT COULD BE WORSE. YOU\nHAVE BEEN INVADED BY A SYMBIOTE\u2014SIMILAR TO THE TYPE FOUND ON THE SAND\nWORLD, BARTEL-BLEETHERS. GIVE US A FEW MORE HOURS TO WORK WITH SAM AND\nWE'LL GET YOU ALL THE PARTICULARS HE CAN GIVE US. HANG ON NOW!\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SOSCITES II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser's reply was short and succinct:\n </p>\n <p>\n  WHAT THE HELL?\n </p>\n <p>\n  SMOKY\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Soscites II's\n  </i>\n  next communication followed within twenty minutes and\nwas signed by the ship's doctor:\n </p>\n <p>\n  JUST A FEW WORDS, SMOKY, IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED. I THOUGHT I'D GET\nTHIS OFF WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM SAM. REMEMBER\nTHAT A SYMBIOTE IS NOT A PARASITE. IT WILL NOT HARM YOU, EXCEPT\nINADVERTENTLY. YOUR WELFARE IS AS ESSENTIAL TO IT AS TO YOU. ALMOST\nCERTAINLY, IF YOU DIE, IT WILL DIE WITH YOU. ANY TROUBLE YOU'VE HAD\nSO FAR WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE SYMBIOTE'S DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING\nITSELF TO ITS NEW ENVIRONMENT. IN A WAY, I ENVY YOU. MORE LATER, WHEN\nWE FINISH WITH SAM.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  J. G. ZARWELL\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser did not answer. The news was so startling, so unforeseen, that\nhis mind refused to accept the actuality. He lay on the scout's bunk\nand stared at the ceiling without conscious attention, and with very\nlittle clear thought, for several hours\u2014until the next communication\ncame in:\n </p>\n <p>\n  WELL, THIS IS WHAT SAM HAS TO SAY, SMOKY. SYMBIOTE AMICABLE AND\nAPPARENTLY SWIFTLY ADAPTABLE. YOUR CHANGING COLOR, DIFFICULTY IN\nEATING AND EVEN BABY TALK WERE THE RESULT OF ITS EFFORTS TO GIVE YOU\nWHAT IT BELIEVED YOU NEEDED OR WANTED.\n </p>\n <p>\n  CHANGING COLOR: PROTECTIVE CAMOUFLAGE. TROUBLE KEEPING FOOD DOWN: IT\nKEPT YOUR STOMACH EMPTY BECAUSE IT SENSED YOU WERE IN TROUBLE AND\nMIGHT HAVE NEED FOR SHARP REFLEXES, WITH NO EXCESS WEIGHT TO CARRY.\nTHE BABY TALK WE AREN'T TOO CERTAIN ABOUT, BUT OUR BEST CONCLUSION IS\nTHAT WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD, YOU WERE MOST HAPPY. IT WAS TRYING TO GIVE\nYOU BACK THAT HAPPY STATE OF MIND. OBVIOUSLY IT QUICKLY RECOGNIZED\nTHE MISTAKES IT MADE AND CORRECTED THEM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SAM CAME UP WITH A FEW MORE IDEAS, BUT WE WANT TO WORK ON THEM A BIT\nBEFORE WE SEND THEM THROUGH. SLEEP ON THIS.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Kaiser could imagine that most of the crew were not too concerned about\nthe trouble he was in. He was not the gregarious type and had no close\nfriends on board. He had hoped to find the solitude he liked best in\nspace, but he had been disappointed. True, there were fewer people\nhere, but he was brought into such intimate contact with them that he\nwould have been more contented living in a crowded city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His naturally unsociable nature was more irksome to the crew because\nhe was more intelligent and efficient than they were. He did his work\nwell and painstakingly and was seldom in error. They would have liked\nhim better had he been more prone to mistakes. He was certain that they\nrespected him, but they did not like him. And he returned the dislike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The suggestion that he get some sleep might not be a bad idea. He\nhadn't slept in over eighteen hours, Kaiser realized\u2014and fell\ninstantly asleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The communicator had a message waiting for him when he awoke:\n </p>\n <p>\n  SAM COULDN'T HELP US MUCH ON THIS PART, BUT AFTER RESEARCH AND MUCH\nDISCUSSION, WE ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING TWO CONCLUSIONS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  FIRST, PHYSICAL PROPERTY OF SYMBIOTE IS EITHER THAT OF A VERY THIN\nLIQUID OR, MORE PROBABLY, A VIRUS FORM WITH SWIFT PROPAGATION\nCHARACTERISTIC. IT UNDOUBTEDLY LIVES IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND\nPERMEATES YOUR SYSTEM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SECOND, IT SEEMED TO US, AS IT MUST HAVE TO YOU, THAT THE SYMBIOTE\nCOULD ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED BY READING YOUR MIND. HOWEVER, WE\nBELIEVE DIFFERENTLY NOW. WE THINK THAT IT HAS SUCH CLOSE CONTACT WITH\nYOUR GLANDS AND THEIR SECRETIONS, WHICH STIMULATE EMOTION, THAT IT CAN\nGAUGE YOUR FEELINGS EVEN MORE ACCURATELY THAN YOU YOURSELF CAN. THUS\nIT CAN JUDGE YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES QUITE ACCURATELY.\n </p>\n <p>\n  WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU TEST OUR THEORY. THERE ARE DOZENS OF WAYS.\nIF YOU ARE STUMPED AND NEED SUGGESTIONS, JUST LET US KNOW. WE AWAIT\nWORD FROM YOU WITH GREAT INTEREST.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  By now, Kaiser had accepted what had happened to him. His distress and\nanxiety were gone and he was impatient to do what he could to establish\nbetter contact with his uninvited tenant. With eager anticipation, he\nset to thinking how it could be done. After a few minutes, an idea\noccurred to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taking a small scalpel from a medical kit, he made a shallow cut in\nhis arm, just deep enough to bleed freely. He knew that the pain would\nsupply the necessary glandular reaction. The cut bled a few slow\ndrops\u2014and as Kaiser watched, a shiny film formed and the bleeding\nstopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That checked pretty well with the ship's theory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps the symbiote had made his senses more acute. He tried closing\nhis eyes and fingering several objects in the room. It seemed to him\nthat he could determine the texture of each better than before, but\nthe test was inconclusive. Walking to the rear of the scout, he tried\nreading the printed words on the instrument panel. Each letter stood\nout sharp and clear!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser wondered if he might not make an immediate, practical use of the\nsymbiote's apparent desire to help him. Concentrating on the discomfort\nof the high humidity and exaggerating his own displeasure with it, he\nwaited. The result surprised and pleased him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The temperature within the scout cabin seemed to lower, the moisture\non his body vanished, and he was more comfortable than he had yet been\nhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a double check, he looked at the ship's thermometer. Temperature\n102, humidity 113\u2014just about the same as it had been on earlier\nreadings.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  During the next twenty-four hours, Kaiser and the mother ship exchanged\nmessages at regular six-hour intervals. In between, he worked at\nrepairing the damaged scout. He had no more success than before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tired easily and lay on the cot often to rest. Each time he seemed\nto drop off to sleep immediately\u2014and awake at the exact times he\nhad decided on beforehand. At first, despite the lack of success in\nstraightening the bent metal of the scout bottom, there had been a\nsubdued exhilaration in reporting each new discovery concerning the\nsymbiote, but as time passed, his enthusiasm ebbed. His one really\nimportant problem was how to repair the scout and he was fast becoming\ndiscouraged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At last Kaiser could bear the futility of his efforts no longer. He\nsent out a terse message to the\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  TAKING SHORT TRIP TO ANOTHER LOCATION ON RIVER. HOPE TO FIND MORE\nINTELLIGENT NATIVES. COULD BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT I FOUND HERE IS\nANALOGOUS TO TRIBE OF MONKEYS ON EARTH. I KNOW THE CHANCE IS SMALL,\nBUT WHAT HAVE I TO LOSE? I CAN'T FIX SCOUT WITHOUT BETTER TOOLS, AND\nIF MY GUESS IS RIGHT, I MAY BE ABLE TO GET EQUIPMENT. EXPECT TO RETURN\nIN TEN OR TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE KEEP CONTACT WITH SCOUT.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SMOKY\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser packed a mudsled with tent, portable generator and guard wires,\na spare sidearm and ammunition, and food for two days. He had noticed\nthat a range of high hills, which caused the bend in the river at\nthe native settlement, seemed to continue its long curve, and he\nwondered if the hills might not turn the river in the shape of a giant\nhorseshoe. He intended to find out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wrapping his equipment in a plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out the\ndoorway and tied it on the sled. He hooked a towline to a harness on\nhis shoulders and began his journey\u2014in the opposite direction from the\nfirst native settlement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked for more than seven hours before he found that his surmise\nhad been correct. And a second cluster of huts, and seal-people in the\nriver, greeted his sight. He received a further pleasant surprise. This\ngroup was decidedly more advanced than the first!\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were little different in actual physical appearance; the change\nwas mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was\nmore subdued, less repugnant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By signs, Kaiser indicated that he came in peace, and they seemed to\nunderstand. A thick-bodied male went solemnly to the river bank and\ncalled to a second, who dived and brought up a mouthful of weed. The\nfirst male took the weed and brought it to Kaiser. This was obviously a\ngesture of friendship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The weed had a white starchy core and looked edible. Kaiser cleaned\npart of it with his handkerchief, bit and chewed it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The weed had a slight iron taste, but was not unpalatable. He swallowed\nthe mouthful and tried another. He ate most of what had been given him\nand waited with some trepidation for a reaction.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  As dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the\nnative settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react\nto the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by\nhis digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at\npeace with this world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise\nof some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in\ncase. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the\nbeast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as\nit went.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of\nshorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in\nthe water when he arrived and were very friendly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded\naround as he swam\u2014they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency\u2014and\noften nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had\ndifficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he\nneared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and\npulled him under.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was\nclowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him\nhelpless. They sank deeper.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of\nbubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee\nup into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the\nsurface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his\nfeet hit the river bottom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and\nseemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying\nto think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but\nthere was none. He shrugged helplessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no longer anything to be gained by staying here\u2014if they\nhad the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for\nthem\u2014and he packed and started back to the scout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey. He had enjoyed\nthe relief from the tedium of spending day after day in the scout, and\nnow he enjoyed the exercise of pulling the mudsled. Above the waist,\nhe wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his\nbare skin were pleasant to feel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The\ntarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free\nit. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling\nthe equipment to the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in\nthe tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly\nhis eyes widened.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Moving quickly to the door of the scout, he shoved his equipment\nthrough and crawled in behind it. He did not consult the communicator,\nas he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped\nplace on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine\ncasing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried\nagain, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The\nmetal beneath yielded slightly\u2014but he felt the palms of his hands\nbruise against the lever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted.\nHis hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased\ntremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried\nagain. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly\u2014until the fuel pump\nhung free!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution\nrest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its\nanticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to\nread the two messages waiting for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first was quite routine:\n </p>\n <p>\n  REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL\nWEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME\nMOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY. AT HEIGHT OF DRY SEASON, PLANET MUST BE\nCOMPLETELY DEVOID OF SURFACE LIQUID.\n </p>\n <p>\n  TO SURVIVE THESE UNUSUAL EXTREMES, SEAL-PEOPLE WOULD NEED EXTREME\nADAPTABILITY. THIS VERIFIES OUR EARLIER GUESS THAT NATIVES HAVE\nSYMBIOSIS WITH THE SAME VIRUS FORM THAT INVADED YOU. WITH SYMBIOTES'\nAID, SUCH RADICAL PHYSICAL CHANGE COULD BE POSSIBLE. WILL KEEP YOU\nINFORMED.\n </p>\n <p>\n  GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE ON NATIVES.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  The second report was not so routine. Kaiser thought he detected a note\nof uneasiness in it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE ALL TIME AND EFFORT TO REPAIR OF SCOUT. INFORMATION\nON SEAL-PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had\ncovered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to\nsleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the morning, another message was waiting:\n </p>\n <p>\n  VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS\nQUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  SS II\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  be\nexperiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they\nwere, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a\nsuggestion of urgency\u2014there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of\ninformation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser.\nHe knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time.\nAnd the\n  <i>\n   Soscites II\n  </i>\n  would not complete its orbit of the planet for\ntwo weeks yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used\nto wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the\nvicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went\nback inside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the\ncaptain himself:\n </p>\n <p>\n  WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR\nSCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN ORDER!\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  H. A. HESSE, CAPT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kaiser pushed the last of his meal\u2014which he had been eating with his\nfingers\u2014into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his\nhands with it and dropped it to the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding\nthe captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for\nserious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only\nto the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment.\nIt was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from\nthe ship on his trip.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And they were almost human!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014that\nwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet\nhim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes\nof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One was a female.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Before he had time to decide, Kaiser heard the small bell of the\ncommunicator from the tent behind him. He stood undecided for a moment,\nthen returned and read the message on the tape:\n </p>\n <p>\n  STILL ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM YOU.\n </p>\n <p>\n  IN MEANTIME, GIVE VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO FOLLOWING.\n </p>\n <p>\n  WE KNOW THAT THE SYMBIOTES MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES IN THE\nPHYSIOLOGY OF THE SEAL-PEOPLE.

He was on the mothership, Soscites II, that was finishing its planet-mapping tour. The team put him in a scout ship and sent him to the planet he calls Big Muddy. During the landing, the scout\u2019s bottom bent inward and flattened the fuel tube. At some point, Kaiser finds himself lost because he doesn\u2019t remember what was happening in the last hours, only the fact that he must fix the scout during the next few weeks. He reads the message tape with the mothership and learns that he had a swollen arm, a fever, periods of blankness, and in the middle of the exchange, he started using baby-talk. Now Kaiser feels better and asks for some information on fixing the scout from the mothership\u2019s team. Then, he walks around the scout, looks at the \u201coctopus\u201d testing the environment of Big Muddy, and heads toward a sluggish river and native seal-people. They are short, with the body of a seal, thick arms, and thumbless hands, and have mammalian characteristics. The man spends some time observing them and then looks at their domed buildings. Soon the mothership informs Kaiser that he has probably been invaded by a symbiote, though it is not supposed to harm him. It\u2019s adaptable and tried to give Kaiser what he emotionally desired. Hours later, the team adds that the symbiote can accurately gauge his feelings, and he needs to test this. Kaiser makes a shallow cut - it immediately heels, his sensory perception improves, and now he can control how humidity affects him. He spends a day trying to repair the scout and then leaves for a day walking trip. He meets another group of seal-people. They seem more advanced than the first ones. Kaiser sleeps in a tent and, in the morning, swims with the natives until one of them starts playfully drowning him. He comes back to his ship and realizes that his physical strength has improved. Kaiser manages to partially fix the metal bottom and report the events of the day to the mothership. They tell him that the natives probably have the symbiote and then order him to repair the ship as soon as possible. In the morning, they repeat that he needs to leave very soon, which puzzles Kaiser. The captain sends an angry message with the order to finish repairing the scout. Kaiser goes to the river and takes the communicator with him. The natives look almost human-like now and use syllabism. A female native invites him to the river, but Kaiser hears that the communicator received a message. He walks back and reads that the team has a suspicion the symbiote can alter Kaiser\u2019s mind. The second group of seal-people was not more advanced - he just became more like them. The man destroys the communicator and follows the girl to the river.

The mothership, Soscites II, has set itself into orbit around the Big Muddy ship, which is why he only has a month to repair the ship. The message he sends from himself is about the seal-people and repairing the scout ship, and the ship responds with a message about how this information has been given to Sam. He responds with a list of his symptoms, and the ship asks for more information. Kaiser wonders why some of his messages are sending in baby talk, but the ship says that everything is perfectly legible. However, after the last message, he does feel better and sends another one to the ship for more information. Kaiser dreams about his wife Helene and their loveless marriage, waking up in a cold sweat an hour later. He decides to go outside, observing how the octopus part of the scout ship is busy sending everything to the mothership. Kaiser goes to visit the seal-people again, and they chirp when he comes close. Some of the seal-people come up to him, but the smell of fish is too much for him to bear. He finds that they are a mindless lot and decides to explore the round domes. For the rest of the day, Kaiser tries to figure out how to fix his scout ship because the Soscites II sent little to no help. The ship tells him that he has been invaded by a symbiote, but it is not dangerous because the symbiote will die with Kaiser if he dies. It also explains the baby talk, as the symbiote was trying to give him what it thought he needed. It is revealed the crew does not like him much because he is intelligent and not prone to mistakes. Later, he accepts that he will live with the symbiote and goes to observe the seal-people again.

Kaiser is grounded because his scout is broken, and he does not have the appropriate equipment to fix it. \n\nIn his communications log with the mother ship, it is revealed that Kaiser had fallen ill.  After he recovered, he took a trip to observe the seal-people. They had been swimming and eating by the river bank and paused in curiosity as Kaiser approached.  Alongside the riverbank lay a few hundred dwellings - round domes built with mud bricks. \n\nUpon receiving more information from the ship, Kaiser and the crew find out that the symbiote is harmless to humans. Any of his prior illnesses was perhaps the symbiote adjusting his body to the new environment and correcting any subsequent mistakes it may have made. In addition, the symbiote can only know what Kaiser wants by reading his mind. At this theory, the crew urged Kaiser to perform his own tests to see if it was true. He tested this theory by changing his body temperature and checking that the room temperature stayed the same, and confirmed it to be true. \n\nKaiser then took another trip,  hoping to find more intelligent natives. He found a group of seal-people that seemed more intelligence in their actions and has less of an odor to them. The next morning, he went swimming with the seal-people and they crowded around him in a friendly manner. However, their overeagerness to play nearly caused Kaiser to drown, and so he headed back to the scout. There, he accidentally turned a sled and found the equipment. He was able to concentrate and fix part of the scout using his mind and tools. As he sent off the news to the ship, he read his messages. \n\nIt appears that Big Muddy undergoes two drastic seasonal changes - extreme moisture and aridity. As a result, the seal-people must be able to physically adapt in order to survive. SS II informs Kaiser that it is due to the natives also having symbiosis, and that all efforts should be devoted to fixing the scout and returning home. Though noting the urgency behind the messages, Kaiser still chose to take another trip to the river banks. This time, he noticed that the seal-people looked almost human and he could detect syllabism in their speech. \n\nIn a frantic last message from the ship, Kaiser learned that the symbiotes have already begun altering Kaiser in more sinister ways. His perceptions on finding seal-peole becoming more intelligent and human-like wasn't actually because of that, but because he himself was becoming more seal-like.

Kaiser went to space to run away from his wife and her brother, his colleagues respect him but do not like him, and none of them is Kaiser\u2019s friend. He\u2019s naturally unsociable and was happier when he was a kid.

It is an effect of the symbiote, trying to bring him back to a happier time in his life which was childhood. Without the baby talk, it would have been impossible for Kaiser and the rest of the ship to realize the symbiote.

His other symptoms like changing color or having trouble keeping food down could have been reasoned to a flu or virus, so the baby talk symptom was an important distinction for the doctor and those aboard SS II to identify what was going on. \n\nAdditionally, the reason behind the baby talk appearing hinted at why Kaiser may have more easily given into staying on Big Muddy and transforming into the seal-life creatures. Sam had said the symbiote instilled baby talk back into Kaiser because it believed that Ksier was most happy when he was a child - and wanted to provide Kaiser with this happy state of mind. This, along with Kaiser's feeling lonely and tormented aboard the SS and on Earth respectively, makes sense why Kaiser might choose another way of life for himself and his happiness.

The ship\u2019s doctor told Kaiser that it was a symptom of the symbiote entering Kaiser\u2019s body, and that the baby talk could be explained. The symbiote wanted Kaiser to feel happy, and it believed that Kaiser had been most happy when he was a baby, so the symbiote tried to replicate those feelings. Overall, the baby talk was the initial sign of the control that the symbiote would have over Kaiser and his body, eventually leading to Kaiser slowly turning into a seal-person."}]}]}

I'm not a doctor\u2014not of medicine, anyway\u2014or a\nlawyer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can't help me. I need an operator in your line.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I work for the United States government. I can't become involved in\nanything illegal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carmen smoothed down the front of his too-tight midnight blue suit and\ntouched the diamond sticking in his silver tie. \"You can't, Professor\nVenetti? Ever hear of the Mafia?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've heard of it,\" I said uneasily. \"An old fraternal organization\nsomething like the Moose or Rosicrucians, founded in Sicily. It\nallegedly controls organized crime in the U.S. But that is a\nresponsibility-eluding myth that honest Italian-Americans are stamping\nout. We don't even like to see the word in print.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can understand\n  <i>\n   honest\n  </i>\n  Italian-Americans feeling that way. But guys\nlike me know the Mafia is still with it. We can put the squeeze on\nmarks like you pretty easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You don't have to tell even a third generation American about the\nMafia. Maybe that was the trouble. I had heard too much and for too\nlong. All the stories I had ever heard about the Mafia, true or false,\nbuilt up an unendurable threat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, I'll try to help you, Carmen. But ... that is, you didn't\nkill any of these people?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He snorted. \"I haven't killed anybody since early 1943.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please,\" I said weakly. \"You needn't incriminate yourself with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was in the Marines,\" Carmen said hotly. \"Listen, Professor, these\naren't no Prohibition times. Not many people get made for a hit these\ndays. Mother, most of these bodies they keep ditching at my club\nhaven't been murdered by anybody. They're accident victims. Rumbums\nwith too much anti-freeze for a summer's day, Spanish-American War vets\ngoing to visit Teddy in the natural course of events. Harry Keno just\nstows them at my place to embarrass me. Figures to make me lose my\nliquor license or take a contempt before the Grand Jury.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't suppose you could just go to the police\u2014\" I saw the answer in\nhis eyes. \"No. I don't suppose you could.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you once, Professor, but I'll tell you again. I have to get rid\nof these bodies they keep leaving in my kitchen. I can take 'em and\nthrow them in the river, sure. But what if me or my boys are stopped en\nroute by some tipped badge?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Quicklime?\" I suggested automatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you talking about? Are you sure you're some kind of\nscientist? Lime doesn't do much to a stiff at all. Kind of putrifies\nthem like....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I forgot,\" I admitted. \"I'd read it in so many stories I'd forgotten\nit wouldn't work. And I suppose the furnace leaves ashes and there's\nalways traces of hair and teeth in the garbage disposal... An\ninteresting problem, at that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I figured you could handle it,\" Carmen said, leaning back comfortably\nin the favorite chair of my bachelor apartment. \"I heard you were\nworking on something to get rid of trash for the government.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That,\" I told him, \"is restricted information. I subcontracted that\nwork from the big telephone laboratories. How did you find it out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ways, Professor, ways.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The government did want me to find a way to dispose of\nwastes\u2014radioactive wastes. It was the most important problem any\ncountry could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a\nsmall-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him\ndispose of hot corpses. It made my scientific blood seethe. But the\nshadow of the Black Hand cooled it off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe I can find something in that area of research to help you,\" I\nsaid. \"I'll call you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't take too long, Professor,\" Carmen said cordially.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The big drum topped with a metallic coolie's hat had started out as a\nneutralizer for radioactivity. Now I didn't know what to call it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The AEC had found burying canisters of hot rubbish in the desert or\nin the Gulf had eventually proved unsatisfactory. Earth tremors or\nchanges of temperature split the tanks in the ground, causing leaks.\nThe undersea containers rusted and corroded through the time, poisoning\nfish and fishermen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Through the SBA I had been awarded a subcontract to work on the\nproblem. The ideal solution would be to find a way to neutralize\nradioactive emanations, alpha, beta, X et cetera. (No, my dear, et\ncetera rays aren't any more dangerous than the rest.) But this is\neasier written than done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, getting energy to destroy energy without producing energy or\nmatter is a violation of the maxim of the conservation of energy. But\nI didn't let that stop me\u2014any more than I would have let the velocity\nof light put any limitations on a spacecraft engine had I been engaged\nto work on one. You can't allow other people's ideas to tie you hand\nand foot. There are some who tell me, however, that my refusal to honor\nsuch time-tested cliches is why I only have a small private laboratory\nowned by myself, my late wife's father and the bank, instead of\nworking in the vast facilities of Bell, Du Pont, or General Motors. To\nthis, I can only smile and nod.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But even refusing to be balked by conservative ideas, I failed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could not neutralize radioactivity. All I had been able to do (by a\nbasic disturbance in the electromagnetogravitational co-ordinant system\nfor Earth-Sun) was to reduce the mass of the radioactive matter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This only concentrated the radiations, as in boiling contaminated\nwater. It did make the hot stuff vaguely easier to handle, but it was\nno breakthrough on the central problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, in the middle of this, I was supposed to find a way to get rid of\nsome damned bodies for Carmen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pressed for time and knowing the results wouldn't have to be so\nprecise or carefully defined for a racketeer as for the United States\ngovernment, I began experimenting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I cut corners.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I bypassed complete safety circuits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the\nwiring diagrams. If I got some kind of passable incinerator I would be\nhappy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned the machine on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lights popped out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were changes that should be made before I tried that again, but\ninstead I only found a larger fuse for a heavier load and jammed that\nin the switchbox.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I flipped my machine into service once again. The lights flickered and\nheld.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dials on my control board told me the story. It was hard to take.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there it was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The internal Scale showed zero.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had had a slightly hot bar of silver alloy inside. It was completely\ngone. Mass zero. The temperature gauge showed that there had been\nno change in centigrade reading that couldn't be explained by the\nmechanical operation of the machine itself. There had been no sudden\ndischarge of electricity or radioactivity. I checked for a standard\nanti-gravity effect but there was none. Gravity inside the cylinder had\ngone to zero but never to minus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was at last violating conservation of energy\u2014not by successfully\ninverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass ...\nby simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side\neffects.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knew the government wouldn't be interested, since I couldn't explain\nhow my device worked. No amount of successful demonstration could ever\nconvince anybody with any scientific training that it actually did work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen wouldn't ask an embarrassing\n\"how\" when he was incapable of understanding the explanation.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, but how does it work?\" Tony Carmen demanded of me, sleeking his\nmirror-black hair and staring up at the disk-topped drum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why do you care?\" I asked irritably. \"It will dispose of your bodies\nfor you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I got a reason that goes beyond the stiff, but let's stick to that\njust for now.\n  <i>\n   Where are these bodies going?\n  </i>\n  I don't want them winding\nup in the D.A.'s bathtub.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not? How could they trace them back to you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're the scientist,\" Tony said hotly. \"I got great respect for those\ncrime lab boys. Maybe the stiff got some of my exclusive brand of talc\non it, I don't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen here, Carmen,\" I said, \"what makes you think these bodies are\ngoing somewhere? Think of it only as a kind of\u2014incinerator.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not on your life, Professor. The gadget don't get hot so how can it\nburn? It don't use enough electricity to fry. It don't cut 'em up\nor crush 'em down, or dissolve them in acid. I've seen disappearing\ncabinets before.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mafia or not, I saw red. \"Are you daring to suggest that I am working\nsome trick with trap doors or sliding panels?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Easy, Professor,\" Carmen said, effortlessly shoving me back with one\npalm. \"I'm not saying you have the machine rigged. It's just that\nyou have to be dropping the stuff through a sliding panel in\u2014well,\neverything around us. You're sliding all that aside and dropping things\nthrough. But I want to know where they wind up. Reasonable?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carmen was an uneducated lout and a criminal but he had an instinctive\nfeel for the mechanics of physics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know where the stuff goes, Carmen,\" I finally admitted. \"It\nmight go into another plane of existence. 'Another dimension' the\nwriters for the American Weekly would describe it. Or into our past, or\nour future.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The swarthy racketeer pursed his lips and apparently did some rapid\ncalculation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't mind the first two, but I don't like them going into the\nfuture. If they do that, they may show up again in six months.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Or six million years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll have to cut that future part out, Professor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was beginning to get a trifle impatient. All those folk tales I had\nheard about the Mafia were getting more distant. \"See here, Carmen, I\ncould lie to you and say they went into the prehistoric past and you\nwould never know the difference. But the truth is, I just don't know\nwhere the processed material goes. There's a chance it may go into\nthe future, yes. But unless it goes exactly one year or exactly so\nmany years it would appear in empty space ... because the earth will\nhave moved from the spot it was transmitted. I don't know for sure.\nPerhaps the slight Deneb-ward movement of the Solar System would wreck\na perfect three-point landing even then and cause the dispatched\nmaterials to burn up from atmospheric friction, like meteors. You will\njust have to take a chance on the future. That's the best I can do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carmen inhaled deeply. \"Okay. I'll risk it. Pretty long odds against\nany squeal on the play. How many of these things can you turn out,\nProfessor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can construct a duplicate of this device so that you may destroy the\nunwanted corpses that you would have me believe are delivered to you\nwith the regularity of the morning milk run.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The racketeer waved that suggestion aside. \"I'm talking about a big\noperation, Venetti. These things can take the place of incinerators,\ngarbage disposals, waste baskets....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Impractical,\" I snorted. \"You don't realize the tremendous amount of\nelectrical power these devices require....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nuts! From what you said, the machine is like a TV set; it takes\na lot of power to get it started, but then on it coasts on its own\ngenerators.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"There's something to what you say,\" I admitted in the face of his\nunexpected information. \"But I can hardly turn my invention over to\nyour entirely persuasive salesmen, I'm sure. This is part of the\nresults of an investigation for the government. Washington will have\nto decide what to do with the machine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, Professor,\" Carmen began, \"the Mafia\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What makes you think I'm any more afraid of the Mafia than I am of the\nF.B.I.? I may have already sealed my fate by letting you in on this\nmuch. Machinegunning is hardly a less attractive fate to me than a poor\nsecurity rating. To me, being dead professionally would be as bad as\nbeing dead biologically.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tony Carmen laid a heavy hand on my shoulder. I finally deduced he\nintended to be cordial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" he said smoothly \"you have to give this to Washington but\nthere are\n  <i>\n   ways\n  </i>\n  , Professor. I know. I'm a business man\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  ?\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He named some of the businesses in which he held large shares of stock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've had experience in this sort of thing. We simply\n  <i>\n   leak\n  </i>\n  the\ninformation to a few hundred well selected persons about all that your\nmachine can do. We'll call 'em Expendables, because they can expend\nanything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I,\" I interjected, \"planned to call it the Venetti Machine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Professor, who calls the radio the Marconi these days?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are Geiger-Muller Counters, though,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't have to give a Geiger counter the sex appeal of a TV set or\na hardtop convertible. We'll call them Expendables. No home will be\ncomplete without one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perfect for disposing of unwanted bodies,\" I mused. \"The murder rate\nwill go alarmingly with those devices within easy reach.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did that stop Sam Colt or Henry Ford?\" Tony Carmen asked reasonably....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Naturally, I was aware that the government would\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  be interested in\nmy machine. I am not a Fortean, a psychic, a psionicist or a screwball.\nBut the government frequently gets things it doesn't know what to do\nwith\u2014like airplanes in the 'twenties. When it doesn't know what to do,\nit doesn't do it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There have been hundreds of workable perpetual motion machines\npatented, for example. Of course, they weren't vices in the strictest\nsense of the word. Many of them used the external power of gravity,\nthey would wear out or slow down in time from friction, but for the\nmeanwhile, for some ten to two hundred years they would just sit there,\nmoving. No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (with\nsome possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which they\ndidn't believe actually could work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got his\nhands on it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The closed sedan was warm, even in early December.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, the street was a progression of shadowed block forms. I was\nshivering slightly, my teeth rattling like the porcelain they were. Was\nthis the storied \"ride,\" I wondered?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carmen finally returned to the car, unlatched the door and slid in. He\ndid not reinsert the ignition key. I did not feel like sprinting down\nthe deserted street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The boys will have it set up in a minute,\" Tony the racketeer informed\nme.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What?\" The firing squad?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Expendable, of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here? You dragged me out here to see how you have prostituted my\ninvention? I presume you've set it up with a 'Keep Our City Clean' sign\npasted on it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled. It was a somewhat nasty sound, or so I imagined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A flashlight winked in the sooty twilight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay. Let's go,\" Tony said, slapping my shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got out of the car, rubbing my flabby bicep. Whenever I took my\nteen-age daughter to the beach from my late wife's parents' home, I\nfrequently found 230 pound bullies did kick sand in my ears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The machine was installed on the corner, half covered with a gloomy\nwhite shroud, and fearlessly plugged into the city lighting system via\na blanketed streetlamp. Two hoods hovered in a doorway ready to take\ncare of the first cop with a couple of fifties or a single .38, as\nnecessity dictated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tony guided my elbow. \"Okay, Professor, I think I understand the bit\nnow, but I'll let you run it up with the flagpole for me, to see how it\nwaves to the national anthem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here?\" I spluttered once more. \"I told you, Carmen, I wanted nothing\nmore to do with you. Your check is still on deposit....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You didn't want anything to do with me in the first place.\" The thug's\nteeth flashed in the night. \"Throw your contraption into gear, buddy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was the first time the tone of respect, even if faked, had gone\nout of his voice. I moved to the switchboard of my invention. What\nremained was as simple as adjusting a modern floor lamp to a medium\nlight position. I flipped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Restraining any impulse toward colloqualism, I was also deeply\ndisturbed by what next occurred.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the massive square shapes on the horizon vanished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What have you done?\" I yelped, ripping the cover off the machine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even under the uncertain illumination of the smogged stars I could see\nthat the unit was half gone\u2014in fact, exactly halved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Squint the Seal is one of my boys. He used to be a mechanic in the\nold days for Burger, Madle, the guys who used to rob banks and stuff.\"\nThere was an unmistakable note of boyish admiration in Carmen's voice.\n\"He figured the thing would work like that. Separate the poles and you\nincrease the size of the working area.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean square the operational field. Your idiot doesn't even know\nmechanics.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, but he knows all about how any kind of machine works.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You call that working?\" I demanded. \"Do you realize what you have\nthere, Carmen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. A disintegrator ray, straight out of\n  <i>\n   Startling Stories\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  My opinion as to the type of person who followed the pages of\nscience-fiction magazines with fluttering lips and tracing finger was\nupheld.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at the old warehouse and of course didn't see it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What was this a test for?\" I asked, fearful of the Frankenstein I had\nmade. \"What are you planning to do now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This was no test, Venetti. This was it. I just wiped out Harry Keno\nand his intimates right in the middle of their confidential squat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good heavens. That's uncouthly old-fashioned of you, Carmen!

Afraid of what the Mafia may do, Professor Venetti finally accepts his request. However, professor Venetti does not abide by the safety and careful principles when he invents the machine, which is named Expendable late after by Tony. He does not know how the machine works either; he creates a device that can turn physical mass into nothingness without knowing where the disposed of mass or energy goes. When he gives the machine to Tony, Tony asks how the machine works, but Professor Venetti cannot explain.

Venetti thinks about all the attempts the government made to dispose of radioactive waste, but they were all futile since there was no way of creating an effective mechanism without breaking the law of energy conservation. He experiments and manages to create a machine that erases any physical object without any thermal or gravitational traces.

By the end of the story, however, even when a machine has been successfully created to fix this issue, another one, an increase in Earth temperature still occurs. In other words, as the law of conversion of energy states in the story that an energy cannot be destroyed without producing another energy is similar to saying that every action has to have a consequence. The readers recognize that they cannot get the best of both worlds all the time.

Additionally, when this machine works, we see the professor ditch his ethical concerns around it and rather starts getting attracted by the financial benefits he is told he could get by the stranger if he were to launch his product on the market. Instead of sticking with his initial intentions of helping the government, he chooses to partner with a large corporation who takes on his machines worldwide as he is promised a big sum of the stocks. This showcases human greed that arises from capitalism and how it can consume an individual to the point that they disregard all ethical thoughts, even when on a global level. Moreover, we are introduced to the idea of convenience the public is used to. Instead of ending his machines, the scientist creates another machine to counter the effect of his first one as he believes the public will not be able to part its convenience.

Four years\nago, if she had only known the right words, he wouldn't be so intent now\non throwing himself away to the sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was a woman scorned. She had to lie to herself. She broke out of the\npress section and ran over to him. \"Marty!\" She brushed past a\ntechnician.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at her with faint surprise on his face. \"Well, Nan!\" he\nmumbled. But he did not put his hand over her own where it touched his\nshoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry, Marty,\" she said in a rush. \"I didn't understand. I couldn't\nsee how much it all meant.\" Her face was flushed, and she spoke as\nrapidly as she could, not noticing that Ish had already gestured away\nthe guards she was afraid would interrupt her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it's all right, now. You got your rockets. You've done it. You\ntrained yourself for it, and now it's over. You've flown your rocket!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked up at her face and shook his head in quiet pity. One of the\nshocked technicians was trying to pull her away, and Ish made no move to\nstop him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly, he was tired, there was something in him that was trying to\nbreak out against his will, and his reaction was that of a child whose\ncandy is being taken away from him after only one bite.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rocket!\" he shouted into her terrified face. \"\n  <i>\n   Rocket!\n  </i>\n  Call that pile\nof tin a rocket?\" He pointed at the weary Mark VII with a trembling arm.\n\"Who cares about the bloody\n  <i>\n   machines\n  </i>\n  ! If I thought roller-skating\nwould get me there, I would have gone to work in a\n  <i>\n   rink\n  </i>\n  when I was\nseventeen! It's\n  <i>\n   getting there\n  </i>\n  that counts! Who gives a good goddam\n  <i>\n   how\n  </i>\n  it's done, or what with!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he stood there, shaking like a leaf, outraged, while the guards came\nand got her.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  \"SIT DOWN, Ish,\" the Flight Surgeon said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   They always begin that way\n  </i>\n  , Isherwood thought. The standard medical\nopening. Sit down. What for? Did somebody really believe that anything\nhe might hear would make him faint? He smiled with as much expression as\nhe ever did, and chose a comfortable chair, rolling the white cylinder\nof a cigarette between his fingers. He glanced at his watch. Fourteen\nhours, thirty-six minutes, and four days to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How's it?\" the FS asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish grinned and shrugged. \"All right.\" But he didn't usually grin. The\nrealization disquieted him a little.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Think you'll make it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Deliberately, rather than automatically, he fell back into his usual\nresponse-pattern. \"Don't know. That's what I'm being paid to find out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh-\n  <i>\n   huh\n  </i>\n  .\" The FS tapped the eraser of his pencil against his teeth.\n\"Look\u2014you want to talk to a man for a while?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What man?\" It didn't really matter. He had a feeling that anything he\nsaid or did now would have a bearing, somehow, on the trip. If they\nwanted him to do something for them, he was bloody well going to do it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fellow named MacKenzie. Big gun in the head-thumping racket.\" The\nFlight Surgeon was trying to be as casual as he could. \"Air Force\ninsisted on it, as a matter of fact,\" he said. \"Can't really blame them.\nAfter all, it's\n  <i>\n   their\n  </i>\n  beast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't want any hole-heads denting it up on them, huh?\" Ish lit the\ncigarette and flipped his lighter shut with a snap of the lid. \"Sure.\nBring him on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The FS smiled. \"Good. He's\u2014uh\u2014he's in the next room. Okay to ask him\nin right now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure.\" Something flickered in Isherwood's eyes. Amusement at the Flight\nSurgeon's discomfort was part of it. Worry was some of the rest.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  MacKENZIE didn't seem to be taking any notes, or paying any special\nattention to the answers Ish was giving to his casual questions. But the\nquestions fell into a pattern that was far from casual, and Ish could\nsee the small button-mike of a portable tape-recorder nestling under the\nman's lapel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Been working your own way for the last seventeen years, haven't you?\"\nMacKenzie seemed to mumble in a perfectly clear voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How's that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The corners of Isherwood's mouth twitched, and he said \"Yes\" for the\nrecorder's benefit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Odd jobs, first of all?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Something like that. Anything I could get, the first few months. After\nI was halfway set up, I stuck to garages and repair shops.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out at the airports around Miami, mostly, wasn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ahuh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Took some of your pay in flying lessons.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacKenzie's face passed no judgements\u2014he simply hunched in his chair,\nseemingly dwarfed by the shoulders of his perfectly tailored suit, his\nstubby fingers twiddling a Phi Beta Kappa key. He was a spare man\u2014only\na step or two away from emaciation. Occasionally, he pushed a tired\nstrand of washed-out hair away from his forehead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish answered him truthfully, without more than ordinary reservations.\nThis was the man who could ground him He was dangerous\u2014red-letter\ndangerous\u2014because of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No family.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish shrugged. \"Not that I know of. Cut out at seventeen. My father was\nmaking good money. He had a pension plan, insurance policies. No need to\nworry about them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish knew the normal reaction a statement like that should have brought.\nMacKenzie's face did not go into a blank of repression\u2014but it still\npassed no judgements.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How's things between you and the opposite sex?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About normal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No wife\u2014no steady girl.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a very good idea, in my racket.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacKenzie grunted. Suddenly, he sat bolt upright in his chair, and swung\ntoward Ish. His lean arm shot out, and his index finger was aimed\nbetween Isherwood's eyes. \"You can't go!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish was on his feet, his fists clenched, the blood throbbing in his\ntemple veins. \"What!\" he roared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacKenzie seemed to collapse in his chair. The brief commanding burst\nwas over, and his face was apologetic, \"Sorry,\" he said. He seemed\ngenuinely abashed. \"Shotgun therapy. Works best, sometimes. You can go,\nall right; I just wanted to get a fast check on your reactions and\ndrives.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish could feel the anger that still ran through him\u2014anger, and more\nfear than he wanted to admit. \"I'm due at a briefing,\" he said tautly.\n\"You through with me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacKenzie nodded, still embarrassed. \"Sorry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish ignored the man's obvious feelings. He stopped at the door to send a\nparting stroke at the thing that had frightened him. \"Big gun in the\npsychiatry racket, huh? Well, your professional lingo's slipping, Doc.\nThey did put\n  <i>\n   some\n  </i>\n  learning in my head at college, you know. Therapy,\nhell! Testing maybe, but you sure didn't do anything to help me!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know,\" MacKenzie said softly. \"I wish I did.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish slammed the door behind him. He stood in the corridor, jamming a\nfresh cigarette in his mouth. He threw a glance at his watch. Twelve\nhours, twenty-two minutes, and four days to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Damn! He was late for the briefing. Odd\u2014that fool psychiatrist hadn't\nseemed to take up that much of his time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged. What difference did it make? As he strode down the hall, he\nlost his momentary puzzlement under the flood of realization that\nnothing could stop him now, that the last hurdle was beaten. He was\ngoing. He was going, and if there were faint echoes of \"Marty!\" ringing\nin the dark background of his mind, they only served to push him faster,\nas they always had. Nothing but death could stop him now.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  ISH LOOKED up bitterly at the Receptionist. \"No,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\n  <i>\n   everybody\n  </i>\n  fills out an application,\" she protested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. I've\n  <i>\n   got\n  </i>\n  a job,\" he said as he had been saying for the last half\nhour.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Receptionist sighed. \"If you'll\n  <i>\n   only\n  </i>\n  read the literature I've\ngiven you, you'll understand that all your previous commitments have\nbeen cancelled.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look, Honey, I've seen company poop sheets before.

The\nreception desk was solid enough. There were IN and OUT and HOLD baskets\non the desk, and the Receptionist seemed to see nothing extraordinary\nabout it. But the room\u2014a big room, he realized\u2014seemed to fade out at\nthe edges, rather than stop at walls. The lighting, too....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's see your back!\" he rapped out, his voice high.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sighed in exasperation. \"If you'd read the\n  <i>\n   literature\n  </i>\n  ...\" She\nswiveled her chair slowly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No wings,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not!\" she snapped. She brushed her hair away from her\nforehead without his telling her to. \"No horns, either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Streamlined, huh?\" he said bitterly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a little different for everybody,\" she said with unexpected\ngentleness. \"It would have to be, wouldn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, I guess so,\" he admitted slowly. Then he lost his momentary awe,\nand his posture grew tense again. He glanced down at his wrist. Six\nhours, forty-seven minutes, and no days to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who do I see?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stared at him, bewildered at the sudden change in his voice. \"See?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About getting out of here! Come on, come on,\" he barked, snapping his\nfingers impatiently. \"I haven't got much time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled sweetly. \"Oh, but you do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can it! Who's your Section boss? Get him down here. On the double. Come\non!\" His face was streaming with perspiration but his voice was firm\nwith the purpose that drove him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her lips closed into an angry line, and she jabbed a finger at a desk\nbutton. \"I'll call the Personnel Manager.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks,\" he said sarcastically, and waited impatiently. Odd, the way\nthe Receptionist looked a little like Nan.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  THE PERSONNEL Manager wore a perfectly-tailored suit. He strode across\nthe lobby floor toward Ish, his hand outstretched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Martin Isherwood!\" he exclaimed enthusiastically. \"I'm\n  <i>\n   very\n  </i>\n  glad to\nmeet you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll bet,\" Ish said dryly, giving the Personnel Manager's hand a short\nshake. \"I've got other ideas. I want out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's all he's been saying for the past forty-five minutes, Sir,\" the\nReceptionist said from behind her desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Personnel Manager frowned. \"Um. Yes. Well, that's not unprecedented.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But hardly usual,\" he added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish found himself liking the man. He had a job to do, and after the\npreliminary formality of the greeting had been passed, he was ready to\nbuckle down to it. Oh, he\u2014shucks?\u2014the Receptionist wasn't such a bad\ngirl, either. He smiled at her. \"Sorry I lost my head,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled back. \"It happens.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took time to give her one more smile and a half-wink, and swung back\nto the Personnel Manager.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now.

They're fueling the\nbeast right now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you know how much red tape you'd have to cut?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish shook his head. \"I don't want to sound nasty, but that's your\nproblem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Personnel Manager hesitated. \"Look\u2014you feel you've got a job\nunfinished. Or, anyway, that's the way you'd put it. But, let's face\nit\u2014that's not really what's galling you. It's not really the job, is\nit? It's just that you think you've been cheated out of what you devoted\nyour life to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish could feel his jaw muscles bunching. \"Don't put words in my mouth!\"\nhe snapped. \"Just get me back, and we'll split hairs about it when I get\naround this way again.\" Suddenly, he found himself pleading. \"All I need\nis a week,\" he said. \"It'll be a rough week\u2014no picnic, no pleasures of\nthe flesh. No smoking, no liquor. I certainly won't be breaking any\nlaws. One week. Get there, putter around for two days, and back again.\nThen, you can do anything you want to\u2014as long as it doesn't look like\nthe trip's responsible, of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Personnel Manager hesitated. \"Suppose\u2014\" he began, but Ish\ninterrupted him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look, they need it, down there. They've got to have a target, someplace\nto go. We're built for it. People have to have\u2014but what am I telling\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  for. If you don't know, who does?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Personnel Manager smiled. \"I was about to say something.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish stopped, abashed. \"Sorry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waved the apology away with a short movement of his hand. \"You've got\nto understand that what you've been saying isn't a valid claim. If it\nwere, human history would be very different, wouldn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Suppose I showed you something, first? Then, you could decide whether\nyou want to stay, after all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long's it going to take?\" Ish flushed under the memory of having\nactually begged for something.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not long,\" the Personnel Manager said. He half-turned and pointed up at\nthe Earth, hanging just beyond the wall of the crater in which they were\nsuddenly standing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Earth,\" the Personnel Manager said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow, Ish was not astonished. He looked up at the Earth, touched by\ncloud and sunlight, marked with ocean and continent, crowned with ice.\nThe unblinking stars filled the night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked around him. The Moon was silent\u2014quiet, patient, waiting.\nSomewhere, a metal glint against the planet above, if it were only large\nenough to be seen, was the Station, and the ship for which the Moon had\nwaited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish walked a short distance. He was leaving no tracks in the pumice the\nages had sown. But it was the way he had thought of it, nevertheless. It\nwas the way the image had slowly built up in his mind, through the\nyears, through the training, through the work. It was what he had aimed\nthe\n  <i>\n   Navion\n  </i>\n  at, that day over the Everglades.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not the same,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Personnel Manager sighed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you see,\" Ish said, \"It\n  <i>\n   can't\n  </i>\n  be the same. I didn't push the\nbeast up here. There wasn't any\n  <i>\n   feel\n  </i>\n  to it. There wasn't any sound of\nrockets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Personnel Manager sighed again. \"There wouldn't be, you know. Taking\noff from the Station, landing here\u2014vacuum.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish shook his head. \"There'd still be a sound. Maybe not for anybody\nelse to hear\u2014and, maybe, maybe there\n  <i>\n   would\n  </i>\n  be. There'd be people,\nback on Earth, who'd hear it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" the Personnel Manager said. His face was grave, but his\neyes were shining a little.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  \"ISH! HEY, Ish, wake up, will you!\" There was a hand on his shoulder.\n\"Will you get a\n  <i>\n   load\n  </i>\n  of this guy!\" the voice said to someone else. \"An\nhour to go, and he's sleeping like the dead.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish willed his eyes to open. He felt his heart begin to move again, felt\nthe blood sluggishly beginning to surge into his veins. His hands and\nfeet were very cold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on, Ish,\" the Crew Chief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" he mumbled. \"Okay. I'm up.\" He sat on the edge of his bunk\nlooking down at his hands. They were blue under the fingernails. He\nsighed, feeling the air moving down into his lungs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stiffly, he got to his feet and began to climb into his G suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Moon opened its face to him. From where he lay, strapped into the\ncontrol seat in the forward bubble, he looked at it emotionlessly, and\nbegan to brake for a landing.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked for footprints in the crater, though he knew he hadn't left\nany. Earth was a familiar sight over his right shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He brought the twin-bubble beast back to the station. They threw\nspotlights on it, for the TV pickups, and thrust microphones at him. He\ncould see broad grins behind the faceplates of the suits the docking\ncrew wore, and they were pounding his back. The interior of the Station\nwas a babbling of voices, a tumult of congratulations. He looked at it\nall, dead-faced, his eyes empty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was easy,\" he said over a world-wide network, and pushed the press\nrepresentatives out of his way.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  MacKENZIE was waiting for him in the crew section. Ish flicked his\nstolid eyes at him, shrugged, and stripped out of his clothes. He pulled\na coverall out of a locker and climbed into it, then went over to his\nbunk and lay down on his side, facing the bulkhead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ish.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was MacKenzie, bending over him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ish grunted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't any good was it? You'd done it all before; you'd been there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was past emotions. \"Yeah?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We couldn't take the chance.\" MacKenzie was trying desperately to\nexplain. \"You were the best there was\u2014but you'd done something to\nyourself by becoming the best. You shut yourself off from your family.\nYou had no close friends, no women. You had no other interests. You were\na rocket pilot\u2014nothing else. You've never read an adult book that\nwasn't a text; you've never listened to a symphony except by accident.\nYou don't know Rembrandt from Norman Rockwell. Nothing.

You might have just kept going.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered the time with the\n  <i>\n   Navion\n  </i>\n  , and nodded. \"I might have.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hypnotized you,\" MacKenzie said. \"You were never dead. I don't know\nwhat the details of your hallucination were, but the important part came\nthrough, all right. You thought you'd been to the Moon before.

His father begins to laugh, and Martin decides to run away. His mother comes in and asks what is wrong, and his father tells her about what their son has claimed as his trade. Margaret is confused, and Howard tries to chase him as Ish hops on a bus and goes away. When the man tells his faculty advisor that he is not interested in a degree, the advisor is exasperated because he has been doing math and engineering for the past nine semesters. Ish says that he is signed up for Astronomy 101, and he tries to argue why this course is different. Ish offers for them to get a beer together instead, since it will be impossible to convince him. He does not understand the advisor\u2019s poetry, and the advisor comments that he is a specialist. The scene then cuts to The Navion taking a boiling thermal under its right wing, buckling suddenly and tilting. Ish tells Nan to relax, but she is afraid of how low he is flying. As Ish does a few more tricks, he suddenly feels fear because the aircraft begins to act strangely. Nan is curious why he is so desperate to win the Vandenberg Cup next week. He reveals that this is all part of his plan of being a rocket pilot, and Nan does not understand. The scene then cuts to four years later, as Ish brings the Mark VII out of her orbit and gives the technicians a report. Nan tells him that he has accomplished his dream, but Ish suddenly feels tired and outraged that the pile of tin can be considered a rocket. The Flight Surgeon then talks to him in another scene, asking if he would like to talk to a man named MacKenzie. Ish agrees, and MacKenzie asks him questions about his personal life. The therapist offers shock therapy, but Martin insists that it did not work. The receptionist at the front desk tries to get him to fill out paperwork too, but he vehemently refuses and complains that he has no time. The scene then cuts to the Personnel Manager meeting him, and they discuss the plans moving forward. The Personnel Manager discusses the rocket some more with him, before the scene cuts to a crew chief waking him up to go to the station. After his trip, MacKenzie is waiting for him at the crew station. MacKenzie tells him that he was hypnotized because his lack of interests and emotions prevented him from being the best. Ish refuses to believe it, and MacKenzie says that he had to cancel the thrill of it by making him experience the Moon and death.

Years later, Martin manages to spin around the Earth on the ship Mark VII for two days. He\u2019s not satisfied. While walking from the ship, he meets Nan, who tells him that she understands his passion now and is happy he\u2019s done. He becomes angry and says that he\u2019s not finished anything. He talks to a psychiatrist named Mackenzie assigned to him by the Air Force. The man asks questions about his first jobs at the airports near Miami. He makes sure Martin has no family. Then he suddenly shocks him by saying that Martin can\u2019t go - this maddens the pilot. Seconds later, the doctor apologizes, claiming that it was shotgun therapy to check his reactions. Next, Martin argues with some receptionist, trying to convince her to help him get back - apparently, he died. He says he has a job. He forces her to call the Personnel Manager. Martin tells the man that he only has six hours before the flight to the Moon and asks for a postponement so that he could finish the journey. The manager then shows Martin the Earth, and the man realizes he\u2019s standing in one of the lunar craters. Martin finally wakes up just an hour before the launch. He completes the flight but is dissatisfied. Mackenzie meets him in the crew section and explains that he had to hypnotize Martin before the flight, make him believe he had died and had been to the Moon. The Air Force was not sure Martin, who had no ties to the planet and no interests, would\u2019ve come back. The hallucination made the pilot believe he had already been to the Moon, thus taking the adventure out of the actual flight.\n"}, {"worker_id": "112", "uid": "67c593a11b7a47a99a6afa89394b75cb", "response_text": "Martin Isherwood, a young man, desiring to be a rocket pilot, cuts his tie to his family around the age of seventeen because his father does not support or believe in his dream.

The advisor tries to convince him to change his career, but he fails. They go to a bar and chat about Ish's crazy dream.\n\nThe scene then changes to a racing plane where Ish, as a trained pilot, teases the girl Nan sitting beside him. He constantly flies a dangerous route to tease her. After a dangerous flight, he talks about the difficulty of marrying her due to his career, and she questions his career. He gives up on making her understand his ambition and breaks up with her. A week later, he wins the championship of the Vandenberg Cup, which will give him a lot of job opportunities in the pilot market.

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n  <i>\n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n  <i>\n   sleep\n  </i>\n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over.

We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n  <i>\n   as usual\n  </i>\n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker was not reassured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it.

It's\na more habitable world.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson disagreed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown.

The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  they?\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n  <i>\n   Marco\nFour\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n  <i>\n   Lament for Old Terra\n  </i>\n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Continuous fission?\n  </i>\n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n  <i>\n   men\n  </i>\n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n  <i>\n   here\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n  </i>\n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n  <i>\n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n  <i>\n   how\n  </i>\n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n  <i>\n   couldn't\n  </i>\n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  succeed?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n  <i>\n   Marco\n  </i>\n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A\n  <i>\n   creche\n  </i>\n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of those old ventures\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached the\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n  <i>\n   Marco Four\n  </i>\n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Friendly?\n  </i>\n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  they come from?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n </p>\n <p class=\"theend\">\n  THE END\n </p>\n <b>\n  Transcriber's Note:\n </b>\n <br/>\n This etext was produced from\n <i>\n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n </i>\n January\n1960.

In the past, they were invaded by an alien species called Hymenops, or the Bees, who enslaved Terrans, and tried to colonize other planets but unexpectedly left years later. The crew members of the spaceship Marco Four are on a mission looking for the slave colonies that were abandoned by the Bees. Farrell, the navigator, is arguing with captain Stryker, Gibson - an engineer - and Xavier, the ship\u2019s mechanic, and is trying to convince them to land on Alphard Six and claiming the planet is not inhabited. Stryker reminds him about the importance of vigilance on unexplored territories and tells Farrell to find a reconnaissance spiral. Something resembling an atomic torpedo explodes near the ship, rocking it. Later, the crew starts discussing who can possibly live on Alphard Six. They know that in the year 3000, there was no one on the planet. The ones who attacked them might be the Hymenopes or some Terrans enslaved by them, or even an unknown alien culture. The screen shows a town with a thousand buildings and a prehistoric ship with rocket propulsion. This ship seems to be eleven hundred years old, which is puzzling. This atomic-powered spaceship neither could\u2019ve been constructed here nor could it have successfully traveled for hundreds of years. The area around Alphard Six was guarded by the Bees for several hundred years. So, it would be impossible for this ancient Terran ship to land on the planet without being detected by them. Farrell interrupts the discussion and suggests they go down and look. He gets on a helihopper, and Xavier quickly disappears in his scouter. The two other crew members left on the ship say that they just detected an electromagnetic vibration. Farrell notices a bonfire near the town. He is ready to report it when his helihopper suddenly jerks, a flare of electric discharge blinds him, and Farrell loses consciousness. He wakes up in an infirmary. A doctor speaks in unintelligible words and gestures to Farrell to follow him. While walking through the corridors of the ancient ship, he notices Xavier\u2019s scouter, and later the Marco Four. Shocked, Farrell rapidly plunges inside the spaceship, and it darts up when suddenly Stryker appears from the sleeping cubicle and orders him to fly back. Gibson explains that Farrell piloted his helihopper into power lines and crashed. The Alphardians tried to communicate with the crew using an electromagnetic wave language and never attacked them. The Bees made the ancestors of these people believe that they were the descendants of an Earth expedition that perished a thousand years ago. The Alphardians don\u2019t even know the Hymenops. Apparently, the Bees wanted to monitor the human species in a natural habitat. But they never understood human logic and after all, left all their colonies.

The crew has gone to the Alphard Six, which has a cool green disk. The other members of the crew are Stryker, Gibson, and Xavier. Stryker berates Farrell and begins citing the Reclamations Handbook about the rules regarding unreclaimed worlds. Farrell argues that it was never colonized, while Gibson looks up from his chess game and says there is no point in taking a chance of not encountering any of the Hymenops. Farrell says that they will never see a Hymenop, but Stryker says that he fought them for the better half of the century and still does not understand how they behave. They decide to find a reconnaissance spiral, despite Farrell grumbling. They examine whether anything is damaged on the Marco Four, after an explosion, and find that the only component that requires fixing is the Zero Transfer computer. Gibson explains that they cannot be Hymenops since the Bees put their faith in Ringwave energy fields. Although Stryker proposes colonists migrating from somewhere else, Gibson explains that it is impossible for the human slaves of the Hymenops to develop interstellar travel in four generations. Farrell volunteers to go down for the field work; Xavier announces that the planet is uninhabited except for a large island. There is a central city with a thousand buildings, and Farrell is relieved they are human. The power the people use runs on continuous fission, which surprises everyone. It is quite surprising for the crew to see an eleven-hundred year old Terran ship land on the planet. Stryker explains to Farrell that it had to be flown here because there are no materials on Alphard Six to create it. Gibson believes that the ship was built during the Twenty-second century, even though the atomic wars destroyed all historical records. Farrell decides that the only way is to go down and see for themselves. Xavier picks up an electromagnetic vibration pattern, and Farrell reports that he is passing over a hamlet nearest to the city. Suddenly, he is hit by an electric discharge and wakes up in an infirmary. A man comes and takes him out, despite speaking a different language, and he realizes that one of the old ventures had actually succeeded. He sees that the Marco Four has been grounded too and runs to the ship before pushing some controls to take off again. Stryker brings the ship down again, and Farrell is shocked because he thought they were shot down. It turns out that the Alphardians had been trying to send a distress signal. Gibson further explains that they had come from one of the first Bee colonies and were led to believe that their ship missed Sirius; however, the colonists are excited to enjoy assimilation. Although the Bees tried to set up the experiment to understand humans, the invaders failed at truly understanding them.

As they travel around, a sudden atomic fire hits the ship and the crew hurry to figure out where it had come from and who potentially caused it. Debating between Hymenops, resurgent colonists,  trans-Alphardians, or even a joint hallucination, the crew decide to investigate further. Xavier, the mechanical, surveys the planet and finds the landscape to be Terran, though with primitive technology at best. These findings leave them more confused than before, as they then debate how an eleven hundred years old ship could be there. \n\nDeciding then to investigate first-hand and see, Farrell goes into the helihopper and enters the colony. Just as Gibson encourages to go forward as it seems like the colony is communicating with them, Farrell crashes into an electrical line and falls unconscious. As he wakes up, Farrell is met by an unfamiliar medic and follows him out to a well-formed colony, marvelling at the presumed success of old ventures. However, he panics when he sees the Marco Four grounded and presumes his crewmates are in danger, and so he hurriedly rushes onboard and puts it in flight. Stryker stumbles out and takes them back down as Gibson quickly explains to Farrell the situation. It turns out that there is no danger at hand - the crash that landed Farrell unconscious was just an electrical line for the colony's hamlets. The colony, the Alphardians, are friendly and excited to be found. Although using Terran architecture and technology, these Alphardians were experimental human subjects by the Hymenops and observed by the Bees. The Bees chose to abandon their control colony when the Alphardians didn't show much - much like the old tale of Terrans not understanding alien culture either. In the end, the Alphardians are excited to assimilate into Terran colonists.

When the youngest navigator, Farrell, attempts to planetfall without scouting the planet, the captain, Stryker, reminds him of the possible danger of the planet and the necessity of reconnaissance. After arguing with other crew members, Farrell finally accepts to scout the unobserved world first. However, they are suddenly attacked by a thing rising from the land below. After the examination, Gibson, the engineer, announces that the only damage is Zero Interval Transfer Computer, used to operate the Transfer jump in space. The repairing time takes a couple of hours. Stryker worries about the possible attack during the repairing time, so they dispute the potential situation of the planet, and none of the hypotheses, such as the Hymenops\u2019 colorizations, Earthmen\u2019s ancient colonization, or the resurgent Terran colonization, hold based on technological development. Stryker concludes that they have to investigate the land themselves. Farrell volunteers to be the one. They see the ground through magnoscanner, finding a damaged spaceship that served as a power supply with the prehistoric technology, namely atomic fission. According to Gibson, the atomic-powered ship was no longer built after the atomic wars in the twenty-second century; the damaged ship must either be flown or be built on the planet. His hypothesis is rejected by Stryker and Farrell based on the impossibility of the long-range travel capability of the atomic-powered spaceship. They continue their endless debate until Farrell takes the helihopper to investigate. Xavier, the mechanic, uses his drone to scout ahead of Farrell, but soon the scouter is detected by the people on the planet. They try to communicate with them with the electron beam. When Farrell reaches the end of the forest, entering the fields, he is suddenly struck and passes out. When he wakes up, he is in an infirmary; an anachronistic man comes in. He talks and gestures unintelligibly, but Farrell follows him out, seeing Xavier\u2019s scouter with port open. When Farrell follows the man, he sees Marco Four landed with the port open. Held by the guess that these people may possess higher technology and capture all of them, Farrell rushes into Marco Four, closes the port, and rises. Stryker appears and comes to him with bewilderment, driving the spaceship to land again. It is later explained that Hymenops take these people as the experimental object. The damaged ship was an expedition ship, which failed its duty. Hymenops found its derelict during their invasion and colonization of Terran planets. They put these people on the planet, made them believe that their ancestors were the crewmembers of the damaged ship, and conducted this experiment as a control group, compared to other experiments on other planets."}]}, {"question_text": "Who is Farrell and what happens to him throughout the story?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "113", "uid": "f1621988b5c4414599cc4db98a12e139", "response_text": "Arthur Farrell is the ship\u2019s navigator, the youngest and most impulsive member of the crew. He tries to convince captain Stryker to land on Alphard Six, claiming that it cannot be inhabited. Stryker doesn\u2019t agree and orders Farrell to find a reconnaissance spiral. After the torpedo explodes near the ship, they all discuss who the attackers could be. Farrell points out that there was no sign of life on Alphard Six around the year 3000, so the inhabitants appeared after this. Farrell agrees to be sent to the planet\u2019s surface and explore. They continue talking and soon see an ancient ship in the center of the planet\u2019s town. Farrell is quick to state that it couldn\u2019t have come from Earth because it would've taken hundreds of years to travel here, and the ship\u2019s ancient technology is not effective enough for such a voyage. Irritated, he interrupts the discussion and suggests he and Xavier go down and see who the inhabitants are. Farrell flies in a helihopper and notices a bonfire near the town. He starts reporting when the helihopper\u2019s carriage crumples, an electric discharge blinds Farrell, and he momentarily loses consciousness. Later, he wakes up with a brutal headache in an infirmary inside the ancient ship. A medic with anachronistic spectacles and gray hair uses unintelligible words and gestures to Farrell to follow him. They pass several open ports, and he sees Xavier\u2019s scouter and later the Marco Four. Shocked, he runs to the spaceship and takes off, when unexpectedly Stryker appears near him, ordering him to take the ship down. Soon Gibson explains that Farrell piloted into metallic power lines, and the crash put him out for almost a day. These Alphardians are incredibly friendly. The object the crew considered a torpedo was actually an emergency boat the inhabitants sent to the spaceship to make sure the people on board noticed their colony. Their spaceship\u2019s technology set off the atomic engines of the boat, making it explode. Gibson and Xavier recognized an old language of frequency modulation the night before, heard about Farrell\u2019s crash, and landed the ship to help. It turns out that the expedition that left Terra for Sirius in 2171 perished soon, and the Bees brought the spacecraft here. They also brought some people from their peripheral colonies conditioned to believe themselves descendants of the expedition. They have been let alone. Farrell understands that the Bees were trying to monitor this group and understand humans\u2019 logic, but they never did. \n\n"}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "4fbb81e1463b4d8b898f1a352757f914", "response_text": "Navigator Arthur Farrell is part of the Terran Reclamations crew on the Marco Four ship.

But nothing like the\nweird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.\n   </b>\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  Jon Karyl\n  was bolting in a new baffle\nplate on the stationary rocket engine.\nIt was a tedious job and took all his\nconcentration. So he wasn't paying too much\nattention to what was going on in other\nparts of the little asteroid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't see the peculiar blue space\nship, its rockets throttled down, as it drifted\nto land only a few hundred yards away from\nhis plastic igloo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nor did he see the half-dozen steel-blue\ncreatures slide out of the peculiar vessel's\nairlock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was only as he crawled out of the\ndepths of the rocket power plant that he\nrealized something was wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By then it was almost too late. The six\nblue figures were only fifty feet away, approaching\nhim at a lope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl took one look and went bounding\nover the asteroid's rocky slopes in fifty-foot\nbounds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When you're a Lone Watcher, and\nstrangers catch you unawares, you don't\nstand still. You move fast. It's the Watcher's\nfirst rule. Stay alive. An Earthship may depend\nupon your life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he fled, Jon Karyl cursed softly under\nhis breath. The automatic alarm should have\nshrilled out a warning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he saved as much of his breath as\nhe could as some sort of power wave tore\nup the rocky sward to his left. He twisted\nand zig-zagged in his flight, trying to get\nout of sight of the strangers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once hidden from their eyes, he could cut\nback and head for the underground entrance\nto the service station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glanced back finally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting\nafter him, and rapidly closing the\ndistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl unsheathed the stubray pistol\nat his side, turned the oxygen dial up for\ngreater exertion, increased the gravity pull\nin his space-suit boots as he neared the\nravine he'd been racing for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The oxygen was just taking hold when\nhe hit the lip of the ravine and began\nsprinting through its man-high bush-strewn\ncourse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The power ray from behind ripped out\ngreat gobs of the sheltering bushes. But\nrunning naturally, bent close to the bottom\nof the ravine, Jon Karyl dodged the bare\nspots. The oxygen made the tremendous\nexertion easy for his lungs as he sped down\nthe dim trail, hidden from the two steel-blue\nstalkers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd eluded them, temporarily at least,\nJon Karyl decided when he finally edged off\nthe dim trail and watched for movement\nalong the route behind him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood up, finally, pushed aside the\nleafy overhang of a bush and looked for\nlandmarks along the edge of the ravine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He found one, a stubby bush, shaped like\na Maltese cross, clinging to the lip of the\nravine. The hidden entrance to the service\nstation wasn't far off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His pistol held ready, he moved quietly\non down the ravine until the old water\ncourse made an abrupt hairpin turn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead of following around the sharp\nbend, Jon Karyl moved straight ahead\nthrough the overhanging bushes until he\ncame to a dense thicket. Dropping to his\nhands and knees he worked his way under\nthe edge of the thicket into a hollowed-out\nspace in the center.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  There\n  , just ahead of him, was the lock\nleading into the service station. Slipping\na key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,\nhe jabbed it into the center of the lock,\nopening the lever housing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pulled strongly on the lever. With a\nhiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.\nJon Karyl darted inside, the door closing\nsoftly behind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the end of the long tunnel he stepped\nto the televisor which was fixed on the area\nsurrounding the station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.\nBut he saw their ship. It squatted\nlike a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut\ntight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tuned the televisor to its widest range\nand finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.\nHe was looking into the stationary rocket\nengine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue\ncame crawling out of the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two Steel-Blues moved toward the\ncenter of the televisor range. They're coming\ntoward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karyl examined the two creatures. They\nwere of the steel-blue color from the crown\nof their egg-shaped heads to the tips of\ntheir walking appendages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were about the height of Karyl\u2014six\nfeet. But where he tapered from broad\nshoulders to flat hips, they were straight up\nand down. They had no legs, just appendages,\nmany-jointed that stretched and\nshrank independent of the other, but keeping\nthe cylindrical body with its four pairs\nof tentacles on a level balance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where their eyes would have been was\nan elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the\negg-head, with its converging ends curving\naround the sides of the head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But\nwhere were their masters?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel-Blues moved out of the range\nof the televisor. A minute later Jon heard\na pounding from the station upstairs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled. They were like the wolf of\npre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to\nblow the house down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outer shell of the station was formed\nfrom stelrylite, the toughest metal in the\nsolar system. With the self-sealing lock of\nthe same resistant material, a mere pounding\nwas nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.\nHe went up the steel ladder leading to the\nstation's power plant and the televisor that\ncould look into every room within the\nstation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heaved a slight sigh when he reached\nthe power room, for right at his hand were\nweapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the\nlock to the station. His teeth suddenly\nclamped down on his lower lip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes\ninto the stelrylite with round-headed metal\nclubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't\nbreak up that easily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up\nthe revolving turret which capped the station\nso that its thin fin pointed at the\nsquat ship of the invaders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he went to the atomic cannon's\nfiring buttons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pressed first the yellow, then the blue\nbutton. Finally the red one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pressed the red button again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be\nfriends.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steel-Blue chuckled.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  Jon\n  followed him through the sundered\nlock of the station. Karyl stopped for a\nmoment to examine the wreckage of the\nlock. It had been punched full of holes as\nif it had been some soft cheese instead of a\nmetal which Earthmen had spent nearly a\ncentury perfecting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue\nsaid. \"But that metal also is found on\nour world. It's probably the softest and most\nmalleable we have. We were surprised you\u2014earthmen,\nis it?\u2014use it as protective\nmetal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked,\nhardly expecting an answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It came anyway. \"For the same reason you\nEarthmen are reaching out farther into your\nsystem. We need living room. You have\nstrategically placed planets for our use. We\nwill use them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had\nbeen preaching preparedness as Earth flung\nher ships into the reaches of the solar system,\ntaking the first long step toward the\nconquest of space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are other races somewhere, they\nargued. As strong and smart as man, many\nof them so transcending man in mental and\ninventive power that we must be prepared to\nstrike the minute danger shows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now here was the answer to the scientists'\nwarning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue.\n\"I couldn't understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered.\nIt was a welcome surprise. Apparently his\nthoughts had to be directed outward, rather\nthan inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to\nread it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping\nlock of the invaders' space ship wondering\nhow he could warn Earth. The Space\nPatrol cruiser was due in for refueling at\nhis service station in 21 days. But by that\ntime he probably would be mouldering in\nthe rocky dust of the asteroid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was pitch dark within the ship but the\nSteel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all\nmaneuvering through the maze of corridors.\nJon followed him, attached to one tentacle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular\nroom, bright with light streaming from\na glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently\nwere near topside of the vessel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Steel-Blue, more massive than his\nguide and with four more pair of tentacles,\nincluding two short ones that grew from the\ntop of its head, spoke out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue\nnodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\"\nJon's guide added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Examine him first, then give him the\ndeath.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from\nthe lighted room through more corridors.\nIf it got too bad he still had the stubray\npistol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on\nthe lonely, nerve-wracking job of service\nstation attendant just to see what it offered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here was a part of it, and it was certainly\nsomething new.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is the examination room,\" his\nSteel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A green effulgence surrounded him.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  There\n  was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the\ntiny microphone on the outside of his\nsuit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go\nthrough his body. Then it seemed as if a\nhalf dozen hands were inside him, examining\nhis internal organs. His stomach contracted.\nHe felt a squeeze on his heart. His\nlungs tickled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were several more queer motions\ninside his body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then another Steel-Blue voice said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He is a soft-metal creature, made up of\nmetals that melt at a very low temperature.\nHe also contains a liquid whose makeup I\ncannot ascertain by ray-probe. Bring him\nback when the torture is done.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What\nkind of torture could this be?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the\nchronometer on his wrist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien\nship and halted expectantly just outside the\nship's lock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the\nstubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my\nway out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he\ntoted up the disadvantages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He either would have to find a hiding\nplace on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues\nwanted him bad enough they could tear the\nwhole place to pieces, or somehow get\naboard the little life ship hidden in the\nservice station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In that he would be just a sitting duck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged off the slight temptation to\nuse the pistol. He was still curious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he was interested in staying alive as\nlong as possible. There was a remote chance\nhe might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously,\nhe glanced toward his belt to see the little\npower pack which, if under ideal conditions,\ncould finger out fifty thousand miles into\nspace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If he could somehow stay alive the 21\ndays he might be able to warn the patrol.\nHe couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for\nhis life would be snuffed out immediately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel-Blue said quietly:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It might be ironical to let you warn\nthat SP ship you keep thinking about. But\nwe know your weapon now. Already our\nship is equipped with a force field designed\nespecially to deflect your atomic guns.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts\nquickly. They can delve deeper than the\nsurface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a\nleash on my thoughts?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel-Blue chuckled. \"You get\u2014absent-minded,\nis it?\u2014every once in a\nwhile.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared\nlugging great sheets of plastic and various\nother equipment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They dumped their loads and began unbundling\nthem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Working swiftly, they built a plastic\nigloo, smaller than the living room in the\nlarger service station igloo. They ranged instruments\ninside\u2014one of them Jon Karyl\nrecognized as an air pump from within the\nstation\u2014and they laid out a pallet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they were done Jon saw a miniature\nreproduction of the service station, lacking\nonly the cannon cap and fin, and with clear\nplastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the\nother.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His Steel-Blue said: \"We have reproduced\nthe atmosphere of your station so that you\nbe watched while you undergo the torture\nunder the normal conditions of your life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is this torture?\" Jon Karyl asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The answer was almost caressing: \"It is\na liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes\njoints to harden if even so much as a drop\nremains on it long. It eats away the metal,\nleaving a scaly residue which crumbles\neventually into dust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will dilute it with a harmless liquid\nfor you since No. 1 does not wish you to die\ninstantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Enter your\"\u2014the Steel-Blue hesitated\u2014\"mausoleum.\nYou die in your own atmosphere.\nHowever, we took the liberty of purifying\nit. There were dangerous elements in\nit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon walked into the little igloo. The\nSteel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials\nand switches on the outside. Jon's space suit\ndeflated. Pressure was building up in the\nigloo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took a sample of the air, found that\nit was good, although quite rich in oxygen\ncompared with what he'd been using in the\nservice station and in his suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet\nand gulped huge draughts of the air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat down on the pallet and waited\nfor the torture to begin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel Blues crowded about the igloo,\nstaring at him through elliptical eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apparently, they too, were waiting for the\ntorture to begin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon thought the excess of oxygen was\nmaking him light-headed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared at a cylinder which was beginning\nto sprout tentacles from the circle.\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked again. An\nopening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a\nspacescope, was appearing in the center of\nthe cylinder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the\nopening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder\nthat had sprouted tentacles. It contained a\nyellowish liquid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the tentacles reached into the\nopening and clasped the glass. The opening\nclosed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor\nappendages, moved toward Jon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't like the looks of the liquid in\nthe tumbler. It looked like an acid of some\nsort. He raised to his feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared\nto blast the cylinder.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  The\n  cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his\neyes jump in his head. He brought the\nstubray gun up\u2014but he was helpless. The\npistol kept on going up. With a deft movement,\none of the tentacles had speared it\nfrom his hand and was holding it out of\nhis reach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon kicked at the glass in the cylinder's\nhand. But he was too slow. Two tentacles\ngripped the kicking leg. Another struck him\nin the chest, knocking him to the pallet. The\nsame tentacle, assisted by a new one,\npinioned his shoulders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Four tentacles held him supine. The cylinder\nlifted a glass-like cap from the tumbler\nof liquid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering\nan old fairy tale he'd read as a kid.\nSomething about a fellow named Socrates\nwho was given a cup of hemlock to drink.\nIt was the finis for Socrates. But the old\nhero had been nonchalant and calm about\nthe whole thing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious\nunto death, relaxed and said, \"All right,\nbub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll\ntake it like a man.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cylinder apparently understood him,\nfor it handed him the tumbler. It even reholstered\nhis stubray pistol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon brought the glass of liquid under his\nnose. The fumes of the liquid were pungent.\nIt brought tears to his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at the cylinder, then at the\nSteel-Blues crowding around the plastic\nigloo. He waved the glass at the audience.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To Earth, ever triumphant,\" he toasted.\nThen he drained the glass at a gulp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Its taste was bitter, and he felt hot\nprickles jab at his scalp. It was like eating\nvery hot peppers. His eyes filled with tears.\nHe coughed as the stuff went down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he was still alive, he thought in\namazement. He'd drunk the hemlock and\nwas still alive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reaction set in quickly. He hadn't\nknown until then how tense he'd been. Now\nwith the torture ordeal over, he relaxed. He\nlaid down on the pallet and went to sleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was one lone Steel-Blue watching\nhim when he rubbed the sleep out of his\neyes and sat up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He vanished almost instantly. He, or another\nlike him, returned immediately accompanied\nby a half-dozen others, including\nthe multi-tentacled creature known as No. 1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One said,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are alive.\" The thought registered\namazement. \"When you lost consciousness,\nwe thought you had\"\u2014there was a hesitation\u2014\"as\nyou say, died.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Jon Karyl said. \"I didn't die. I\nwas just plain dead-beat so I went to sleep.\"\nThe Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good it is that you live. The torture\nwill continue,\" spoke No. 1 before loping\naway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cylinder business began again. This\ntime, Jon drank the bitter liquid slowly, trying\nto figure out what it was. It had a\nfamiliar, tantalizing taste but he couldn't\nquite put a taste-finger on it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His belly said he was hungry. He glanced\nat his chronometer. Only 20 days left before\nthe SP ship arrived.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Would this torture\u2014he chuckled\u2014last\nuntil then? But he was growing more and\nmore conscious that his belly was screaming\nfor hunger. The liquid had taken the edge\noff his thirst.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was on the fifth day of his torture that\nJon Karyl decided that he was going to get\nsomething to eat or perish in the attempt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cylinder sat passively in its niche in\nthe circle. A dozen Steel-Blues were watching\nas Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed\nhis stubray.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They merely watched as he pressed the\nstubray's firing stud. Invisible rays licked\nout of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol.\nThe plastic splintered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon was out of his goldfish bowl and\nstriding toward his own igloo adjacent to\nthe service station when a Steel-Blue\naccosted him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out of my way,\" grunted Jon, waving\nthe stubray. \"I'm hungry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,\" said\nthe creature who barred his way. \"Go back\nto your torture.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of\nyour tentacles and eat it without seasoning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eat?\" The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I want to refuel. I've got to have food\nto keep my engine going.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steel-Blue chuckled. \"So the hemlock, as\nyou call it, is beginning to affect you at\nlast? Back to the torture room.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Like R-dust,\" Jon growled. He pressed\nthe firing stud on the stubray gun. One of\nSteel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to\nthe rocky sward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used\nonce before. A tentacle danced over it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly Jon found himself standing on\na pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue had cut a\nswath around him 15 feet deep and five feet\nwide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Back to the room,\" Steel-Blue commanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon resheathed the stubray pistol,\nshrugged non-committally and leaped the\ntrench. He walked slowly back and reentered\nthe torture chamber.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage\nhe'd done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he watched them, Jon was still curious,\nbut he was getting mad underneath at\nthe cold egoism of the Steel-Blues.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the shimmering clouds of Earth, by\nher green fields, and dark forests, he'd\nstay alive to warn the SP ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, he'd stay alive till then. And send\nthe story of the Steel-Blues' corrosive acid\nto it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could\nequip themselves with spray guns and squirt\ncitric acid and watch the Steel-Blues fade\naway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The\nfruit acid of Earth to repel these invaders\u2014it\ndoesn't sound possible. That couldn't be\nthe answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl\ndiscovered a week later.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel-Blue who had captured him in\nthe power room of the service station came\nin to examine him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're still holding out, I see,\" he observed\nafter poking Jon in every sensitive\npart of his body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase\nthe power of the\u2014ah\u2014hemlock. How do\nyou feel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness\nof hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he\nanswered honestly enough: \"My guts feel as\nif they're chewing each other up. My bones\nache. My joints creak. I can't coordinate I'm\nso hungry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That is the hemlock,\" Steel-Blue said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was when he quaffed the new and\nstronger draught that Jon knew that his\nhope that it was citric acid was squelched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The acid taste was weaker which meant\nthat the citric acid was the diluting liquid.\nIt was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath\nthe tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive\nacid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak\nhe didn't feel much like moving around. He\nlet the cylinder feed him the hemlock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. 1 came again to see him, and went\naway chuckling, \"Decrease the dilution.\nThis Earthman at last is beginning to\nsuffer.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  Staying\n  alive had now become a fetish\nwith Jon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the sixteenth day, the Earthman realized\nthat the Steel-Blues also were waiting\nfor the SP ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The extra-terrestrials had repaired the\nblue ship where the service station atomic\nray had struck. And they were doing a little\ntarget practice with plastic bubbles only a\nfew miles above the asteroid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When his chronometer clocked off the\nbeginning of the twenty-first day, Jon received\na tumbler of the hemlock from the\nhands of No. 1 himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is the hemlock,\" he chuckled, \"undiluted.\nDrink it and your torture is over.\nYou will die before your SP ship is destroyed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have played with you long enough.\nToday we begin to toy with your SP ship.\nDrink up, Earthman, drink to enslavement.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Weak though he was Jon lunged to his\nfeet, spilling the tumbler of liquid. It ran\ncool along the plastic arm of his space suit.\nHe changed his mind about throwing the\ncontents on No. 1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a smile he set the glass at his lips\nand drank. Then he laughed at No. 1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The SP ship will turn your ship into\njelly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. 1 swept out, chuckling. \"Boast if you\nwill, Earthman, it's your last chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was an exultation in Jon's heart\nthat deadened the hunger and washed away\nthe nausea.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At last he knew what the hemlock was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat on the pallet adjusting the little\npower-pack radio. The SP ship should now\nbe within range of the set. The space patrol\nwas notorious for its accuracy in keeping to\nschedule. Seconds counted like years. They\nhad to be on the nose, or it meant disaster\nor death.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sent out the call letters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ... AX\nto SP-101 ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three times he sent the call, then began\nsending his message, hoping that his signal\nwas reaching the ship. He couldn't know if\nthey answered. Though the power pack\ncould get out a message over a vast distance,\nit could not pick up messages even\nwhen backed by an SP ship's power unless\nthe ship was only a few hundred miles\naway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The power pack was strictly a distress\nsignal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't know how long he'd been\nsending, nor how many times his weary\nvoice had repeated the short but desperate\nmessage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kept watching the heavens and hoping.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly he knew the SP ship was coming,\nfor the blue ship of the Steel-Blues was\nrising silently from the asteroid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up and up it rose, then flames flickered\nin a circle about its curious shape. The ship\ndisappeared, suddenly accelerating.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl strained his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally he looked away from the heavens\nto the two Steel-Blues who stood negligently\noutside the goldfish bowl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once more, Jon used the stubray pistol.\nHe marched out of the plastic igloo and ran\ntoward the service station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't know how weak he was until\nhe stumbled and fell only a few feet from\nhis prison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Steel-Blues just watched him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He crawled on, around the circular pit in\nthe sward of the asteroid where one Steel-Blue\nhad shown him the power of his\nweapon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd been crawling through a nightmare\nfor years when the quiet voice penetrated\nhis dulled mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take it easy, Karyl. You're among\nfriends.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pried open his eyes with his will. He\nsaw the blue and gold of a space guard's\nuniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  He was\n  still weak days later when\nCapt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you\nwhat they thought was sure death, and it's\nthe only thing that kept you going long\nenough to warn us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was dumb for a long time,\" Karyl said.\n\"I thought that it was the acid, almost to\nthe very last. But when I drank that last\nglass, I knew they didn't have a chance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They were metal monsters. No wonder\nthey feared that liquid. It would rust their\njoints, short their wiring, and kill them.\nNo wonder they stared when I kept alive\nafter drinking enough to completely annihilate\na half-dozen of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what happened when you met the\nship?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The space captain grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not much. Our crew was busy creating\na hollow shell filled with\n  <i>\n   water\n  </i>\n  to be shot\nout of a rocket tube converted into a projectile\nthrower.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put\ntraction beams on us and started tugging us\ntoward the asteroid. We tried a couple of\natomic shots but when they just glanced off,\nwe gave up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They weren't expecting the shell of\nwater. When it hit that blue ship, you could\nalmost see it oxidize before your eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess they knew what was wrong right\naway. They let go the traction beams and\ntried to get away. They forgot about the\nforce field, so we just poured atomic fire\ninto the weakening ship. It just melted\naway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon Karyl got up from the divan where\nhe'd been lying. \"They thought I was a\nmetal creature, too. But where do you suppose\nthey came from?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jon set two glasses on the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have a drink of the best damn water in\nthe solar system?\" He asked Capt. Small.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't mind if I do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The water twinkled in the two glasses,\nwinking as if it knew just what it had\ndone.\n </p>\n <b>\n  Transcriber's Note:\n </b>\n This etext was produced from\n <i>\n  Planet Stories\n </i>\n July 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

A peculiar spaceship lands a few hundred yards away from his plastic igloo, and a half-dozen steel-blue creatures slide out of the airlock. When he climbs up again and sees the creatures, Jon runs for the rocky slopes. Jon brings out his stubray pistol and turns up the oxygen dial for greater exertion as two of the creatures continue to chase him. He manages to elude them by going down a dim trail temporarily. Once Jon finds the stubby bush shaped like a Maltese cross, he keeps going until he reaches the hollowed-out space. He observes the steel-blue creatures from the televisor, noting how they head towards the station to try and destroy it. Although the station is not supposed to break because it is made out of stelrylite, the creatures pound holes into the station with round-headed metal clubs. He presses the atomic cannon\u2019s firing buttons and finds that it is impossible to damage the ship. Suddenly, a Steel-Blue paralyzes him from the waist down and tells him to come with them. Once outside, the Steel-Blue explains to Jon that the most protective metal they use is the softest one in their world. He follows the Steel-Blue into the ship, where a more massive one tells Jon\u2019s Steel-Blue to examine him and give him death. The Steel-Blue brings him to the examination room, where Jon is curious about this whole interaction. He thinks about warning the SP patrol and using his weapon, but his Steel-Blue tells him they are already aware of it. The other Steel-Blues begin reproducing the service station, and Jon\u2019s Steel-Blue tells him that his torture will be dissolved in a liquid they have prepared. When he goes inside, he prepares to blast at the cylinder with his gun. However, the tentacles take it away from him and bring him a glass-like cup filled with liquid. Jon toasts to Earth and drinks the liquid, going to sleep shortly after. When he awakes again, the Steel-Blues are amazed that he is still alive. On the fifth day, Jon breaks out of his plastic bowl with his subray because he is hungry. The Steel-Blues try to torture him more with the poison, and Jon has now made it a fetish to stay alive. When Jon takes the drink from No. 1, it tells him that the SP ship will be destroyed. Jon tries to send a distress signal, and he watches as the SP ship begins to come abruptly. The Steel-Blues watch as he tries to escape, only to be greeted by the voice of a space guard. Captain Ron Small of SP-101 tells him later that the Steel-Blues fed him a liquid they feared. The Steel-Blues tried to fight back, but the SP ship just shot a water rocket and set it on atomic fire. Captain Small and Jon then toast to water.

Escaping away back to the service station, he fires atomic cannons at the creatures' ship only to watch it ricochet off. Suddenly, a Steel-Blue temporarily paralyzes his legs and instructs him to follow. Karyl finds out - through an exchange of mind-reading - that these Steel-Blues are just like Earthmen as they seek out further planets to inhabit. \n\nAnother Steel-Blue instructs Karyl's Steel-Blue to examine him and then torture him, leaving him to his death. Proclaimed to be a soft-metal creature, Karyl is instructed to enter a plastic igloo. This igloo is a reproduction of Earth's atmosphere, so the Steel-Blues can observe the torture. In it, Karyl is given a series of dilutions containing a liquid that dissolves metal, with the last tumbler containing the pure liquid. Though Karyl initially tries to escape using his stubray pistol, he becomes curious about death and drinks the liquid. To the Steel-Blues surprise, he survives the first night and all subsequent days as well, seemingly only suffering from a lack of food and nutrition. Karyl vows to stay alive until the SP ship can rescue him, but his Steel-Blue warns him that they will be ready to attack it when it comes. \n\nOn the sixteenth day, the Steel-Blues await Karyl to die as they give him the final undiluted liquid. Drinking it, Karyl laughs instead and taunts the Steel-Blues. Using a power-pack radio, he sends a warning signal to the SP ship. When it arrives, he stumbles out of the igloo and crawls until he hears a human voice. Later on in his recovery, he finds out that his warning was successful and that the liquid thought to be poison by the Steel-Blues was in fact water. Beneficial to humans, but harmful to robots. In fact, this is what the Captain of the SP ship used to attack the Steel-Blues.

The Earth space patrol cruiser will come to refuel their ship after 21 days; Jon knows that he has to stay alive until then to alert the SP ship. During the torture, namely drinking the unknown liquid, Jon attempts to escape but fails. The Steel-Blues every day watch him undergo torture. At the beginning of the torture, the liquid is diluted and tastes like some strong acid. As the days pass, the diluted portion decreases, and Jon realizes what the liquid is. Finally, on the last day, when the SP ship is scheduled to come, and Jon is fed with the undiluted liquid, he realizes that it is water and the weakness of the Steel-Blues.

When Jon breaks out of his tank to find food, his Steel-Blue tells him that it is the first of the creatures that he has met. It commands him to go back to the tank. Although it seems friendly at first, Jon and the Steel-Blue do not have any sort of positive relationship. The Steel-Blue wishes to see him suffer, while Jon wants to survive and get out of the torture room.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p class=\"cap\">\n  They all\n  knew he was a spacer\nbecause of the white goggle marks\non his sun-scorched face, and so\nthey tolerated him and helped him.\nThey even made allowances for him\nwhen he staggered and fell in the\naisle of the bus while pursuing the\nharassed little housewife from seat\nto seat and cajoling her to sit and\ntalk with him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Having fallen, he decided to\nsleep in the aisle. Two men helped\nhim to the back of the bus, dumped\nhim on the rear seat, and tucked his\ngin bottle safely out of sight. After\nall, he had not seen Earth for nine\nmonths, and judging by the crusted\nmatter about his eyelids, he couldn't\nhave seen it too well now, even if\nhe had been sober. Glare-blindness,\ngravity-legs, and agoraphobia were\nexcuses for a lot of things, when a\nman was just back from Big Bottomless.\nAnd who could blame a\nman for acting strangely?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Minutes later, he was back up the\naisle and swaying giddily over the\nlittle housewife. \"How!\" he said.\n\"Me Chief Broken Wing. You\nwanta Indian wrestle?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl, who sat nervously staring\nat him, smiled wanly, and\nshook her head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he\nburbled affectionately, crashing into\nthe seat beside her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two men slid out of their\nseats, and a hand clamped his shoulder.\n\"Come on, Broken Wing, let's\ngo back to bed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My name's Hogey,\" he said.\n\"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding\nabout being a Indian.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a\ndrink.\" They got him on his feet,\nand led him stumbling back down\nthe aisle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My ma was half Cherokee, see?\nThat's how come I said it. You\nwanta hear a war whoop? Real\nstuff.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He cupped his hands to his\nmouth and favored them with a\nblood-curdling proof of his ancestry,\nwhile the female passengers\nstirred restlessly and hunched in\ntheir seats. The driver stopped the\nbus and went back to warn him\nagainst any further display. The\ndriver flashed a deputy's badge and\nthreatened to turn him over to a\nconstable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey\ntold him. \"I got me a son now,\nthat's why. You know? A little\nbaby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen\nhim yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will you just sit still and be\nquiet then, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Big Hogey nodded emphatically.\n\"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to\nmake any trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the bus started again, he\nfell on his side and lay still. He\nmade retching sounds for a time,\nthen rested, snoring softly. The bus\ndriver woke him again at Caine's\njunction, retrieved his gin bottle\nfrom behind the seat, and helped\nhim down the aisle and out of the\nbus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Big Hogey stumbled about for a\nmoment, then sat down hard in the\ngravel at the shoulder of the road.\nThe driver paused with one foot on\nthe step, looking around. There was\nnot even a store at the road junction,\nbut only a freight building\nnext to the railroad track, a couple\nof farmhouses at the edge of a side-road,\nand, just across the way, a deserted\nfilling station with a sagging\nroof. The land was Great Plains\ncountry, treeless, barren, and rolling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Big Hogey got up and staggered\naround in front of the bus, clutching\nat it for support, losing his\nduffle bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The\ndriver warned. With a surge of unwelcome\ncompassion he trotted\naround after his troublesome passenger,\ntaking his arm as he sagged\nagain. \"You crossing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme\nalone, I'm okay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The driver started across the\nhighway with him. The traffic was\nsparse, but fast and dangerous in\nthe central ninety-mile lane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting.\n\"I'm a tumbler, ya know?\nGravity's got me. Damn gravity.\nI'm not used to gravity, ya know? I\nused to be a tumbler\u2014\n  <i>\n   huk!\n  </i>\n  \u2014only\nnow I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count\nof li'l Hogey. You know about li'l\nHogey?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. Your son. Come on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say, you gotta son? I bet you\ngotta son.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two kids,\" said the driver,\ncatching Hogey's bag as it slipped\nfrom his shoulder. \"Both girls.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say, you oughta be home with\nthem kids. Man oughta stick with\nhis family. You oughta get another\njob.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly,\nwaggled a moralistic finger, skidded\non the gravel as they stepped\nonto the opposite shoulder, and\nsprawled again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The driver blew a weary breath,\nlooked down at him, and shook his\nhead. Maybe it'd be kinder to find\na constable after all. This guy could\nget himself killed, wandering\naround loose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Somebody supposed to meet\nyou?\" he asked, squinting around\nat the dusty hills.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Huk!\n  </i>\n  \u2014who, me?\" Hogey giggled,\nbelched, and shook his head.\n\"Nope. Nobody knows I'm coming.\nS'prise. I'm supposed to be here a\nweek ago.\" He looked up at the\ndriver with a pained expression.\n\"Week late, ya know? Marie's\ngonna be sore\u2014woo-\n  <i>\n   hoo\n  </i>\n  !\u2014is she\ngonna be sore!\" He waggled his\nhead severely at the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which way are you going?\" the\ndriver grunted impatiently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hogey pointed down the side-road\nthat led back into the hills.\n\"Marie's pop's place. You know\nwhere? 'Bout three miles from\nhere. Gotta walk, I guess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't,\" the driver warned.\n\"You sit there by the culvert till\nyou get a ride. Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hogey nodded forlornly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now stay out of the road,\" the\ndriver warned, then hurried back\nacross the highway. Moments later,\nthe atomic battery-driven motors\ndroned mournfully, and the bus\npulled away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Big Hogey blinked after it, rubbing\nthe back of his neck. \"Nice\npeople,\" he said. \"Nice buncha people.\nAll hoofers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a grunt and a lurch, he got\nto his feet, but his legs wouldn't\nwork right. With his tumbler's reflexes,\nhe fought to right himself\nwith frantic arm motions, but gravity\nclaimed him, and he went stumbling\ninto the ditch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\"\nhe cried.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bottom of the ditch was wet,\nand he crawled up the embankment\nwith mud-soaked knees, and sat on\nthe shoulder again. The gin bottle\nwas still intact. He had himself a\nlong fiery drink, and it warmed him\ndeep down. He blinked around at\nthe gaunt and treeless land.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sun was almost down, forge-red\non a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked\nsky faded into sulphurous\nyellow toward the zenith, and the\nvery air that hung over the land\nseemed full of yellow smoke, the\nomnipresent dust of the plains.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A farm truck turned onto the\nside-road and moaned away, its\ndriver hardly glancing at the dark\nyoung man who sat swaying on his\nduffle bag near the culvert. Hogey\nscarcely noticed the vehicle. He just\nkept staring at the crazy sun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook his head. It wasn't really\nthe sun. The sun, the real sun,\nwas a hateful eye-sizzling horror in\nthe dead black pit. It painted everything\nwith pure white pain, and you\nsaw things by the reflected pain-light.\nThe fat red sun was strictly a\nphoney, and it didn't fool him any.\nHe hated it for what he knew it was\nbehind the gory mask, and for what\nit had done to his eyes.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  With a grunt, he got to his feet,\nmanaged to shoulder the duffle bag,\nand started off down the middle of\nthe farm road, lurching from side\nto side, and keeping his eyes on the\nrolling distances. Another car turned\nonto the side-road, honking angrily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hogey tried to turn around to\nlook at it, but he forgot to shift his\nfooting. He staggered and went\ndown on the pavement. The car's\ntires screeched on the hot asphalt.\nHogey lay there for a moment,\ngroaning. That one had hurt his\nhip. A car door slammed and a big\nman with a florid face got out and\nstalked toward him, looking angry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What the hell's the matter with\nyou, fella?\" he drawled. \"You\nsoused? Man, you've really got a\nload.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hogey got up doggedly, shaking\nhis head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he\nprevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't\nstand the gravity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The burly farmer retrieved his\ngin bottle for him, still miraculously\nunbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\"\nhe grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better\nget home pronto.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest,\nI'm just space burned. You\nknow?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway?\nDo you live around here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was obvious that the big man\nhad taken him for a hobo or a\ntramp. Hogey pulled himself together.\n\"Goin' to the Hauptman's\nplace. Marie. You know Marie?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The farmer's eyebrows went up.\n\"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know\nher. Only she's Marie Parker now.\nHas been, nigh on six years. Say\u2014\"\nHe paused, then gaped. \"You ain't\nher husband by any chance?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey\nParker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I'll be\u2014! Get in the car.\nI'm going right past John Hauptman's\nplace. Boy, you're in no\nshape to walk it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned wryly, waggled his\nhead, and helped Hogey and his\nbag into the back seat. A woman\nwith a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly\nbeside the farmer in the front,\nand she neither greeted the passenger\nnor looked around.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They don't make cars like this\nanymore,\" the farmer called over\nthe growl of the ancient gasoline\nengine and the grind of gears.\n\"You can have them new atomics\nwith their loads of hot isotopes\nunder the seat. Ain't safe, I say\u2014eh,\nMartha?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The woman with the sun-baked\nneck quivered her head slightly.\n\"A car like this was good enough\nfor Pa, an' I reckon it's good\nenough for us,\" she drawled mournfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later the car drew\nin to the side of the road. \"Reckon\nyou can walk it from here,\" the\nfarmer said. \"That's Hauptman's\nroad just up ahead.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He helped Hogey out of the car\nand drove away without looking\nback to see if Hogey stayed on his\nfeet. The woman with the sun-baked\nneck was suddenly talking\ngarrulously in his direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was twilight. The sun had set,\nand the yellow sky was turning\ngray. Hogey was too tired to go on,\nand his legs would no longer hold\nhim. He blinked around at the land,\ngot his eyes focused, and found\nwhat looked like Hauptman's place\non a distant hillside. It was a big\nframe house surrounded by a wheatfield,\nand a few scrawny trees. Having\nlocated it, he stretched out in\nthe tall grass beyond the ditch to\ntake a little rest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somewhere dogs were barking,\nand a cricket sang creaking monotony\nin the grass. Once there was the\ndistant thunder of a rocket blast\nfrom the launching station six miles\nto the west, but it faded quickly. An\nA-motored convertible whined past\non the road, but Hogey went unseen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he awoke, it was night,\nand he was shivering. His stomach\nwas screeching, and his nerves dancing\nwith high voltages. He sat up\nand groped for his watch, then remembered\nhe had pawned it after\nthe poker game. Remembering the\ngame and the results of the game\nmade him wince and bite his lip\nand grope for the bottle again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat breathing heavily for a\nmoment after the stiff drink. Equating\ntime to position had become\nsecond nature with him, but he had\nto think for a moment because his\ndefective vision prevented him from\nseeing the Earth-crescent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Vega was almost straight above\nhim in the late August sky, so he\nknew it wasn't much after sundown\u2014probably\nabout eight o'clock. He\nbraced himself with another swallow\nof gin, picked himself up and\ngot back to the road, feeling a little\nsobered after the nap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He limped on up the pavement\nand turned left at the narrow drive\nthat led between barbed-wire fences\ntoward the Hauptman farmhouse,\nfive hundred yards or so from the\nfarm road. The fields on his left\nbelonged to Marie's father, he\nknew. He was getting close\u2014close\nto home and woman and child.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dropped the bag suddenly\nand leaned against a fence post,\nrolling his head on his forearms\nand choking in spasms of air. He\nwas shaking all over, and his belly\nwrithed. He wanted to turn and\nrun. He wanted to crawl out in the\ngrass and hide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What were they going to say?\nAnd Marie, Marie most of all.\nHow was he going to tell her about\nthe money?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Six hitches in space, and every\ntime the promise had been the\nsame:\n  <i>\n   One more tour, baby, and\nwe'll have enough dough, and then\nI'll quit for good. One more time,\nand we'll have our stake\u2014enough\nto open a little business, or buy a\nhouse with a mortgage and get a\njob.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And she had waited, but the\nmoney had never been quite enough\nuntil this time. This time the tour\nhad lasted nine months, and he had\nsigned on for every run from station\nto moon-base to pick up the\nbonuses. And this time he'd made\nit. Two weeks ago, there had been\nforty-eight hundred in the bank.\nAnd now ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Why?\n  </i>\n  \" he groaned, striking his\nforehead against his forearms. His\narm slipped, and his head hit the\ntop of the fencepost, and the pain\nblinded him for a moment. He staggered\nback into the road with a\nlow roar, wiped blood from his\nforehead, and savagely kicked his\nbag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It rolled a couple of yards up the\nroad. He leaped after it and kicked\nit again. When he had finished\nwith it, he stood panting and angry,\nbut feeling better. He shouldered\nthe bag and hiked on toward the\nfarmhouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They're hoofers, that's all\u2014just\nan Earth-chained bunch of hoofers,\neven Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A\nborn tumbler. Know what that\nmeans? It means\u2014God, what does\nit mean? It means out in Big Bottomless,\nwhere Earth's like a fat\nmoon with fuzzy mold growing on\nit. Mold, that's all you are, just\nmold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A dog barked, and he wondered\nif he had been muttering aloud. He\ncame to a fence-gap and paused in\nthe darkness. The road wound\naround and came up the hill in\nfront of the house. Maybe they were\nsitting on the porch. Maybe they'd\nalready heard him coming. Maybe ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was trembling again. He\nfished the fifth of gin out of his\ncoat pocket and sloshed it. Still over\nhalf a pint. He decided to kill it. It\nwouldn't do to go home with a\nbottle sticking out of his pocket.\nHe stood there in the night wind,\nsipping at it, and watching the reddish\nmoon come up in the east. The\nmoon looked as phoney as the\nsetting sun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He straightened in sudden determination.\nIt had to be sometime.\nGet it over with, get it over with\nnow. He opened the fence-gap, slipped\nthrough, and closed it firmly\nbehind him. He retrieved his bag,\nand waded quietly through the tall\ngrass until he reached the hedge\nwhich divided an area of sickly\npeach trees from the field. He got\nover the hedge somehow, and started\nthrough the trees toward the\nhouse. He stumbled over some old\nboards, and they clattered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Shhh!\n  </i>\n  \" he hissed, and moved\non.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dogs were barking angrily,\nand he heard a screen door slam.\nHe stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ho there!\" a male voice called\nexperimentally from the house.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of Marie's brothers. Hogey\nstood frozen in the shadow of a\npeach tree, waiting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Anybody out there?\" the man\ncalled again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hogey waited, then heard the\nman muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic\n'im.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hound's bark became eager.\nThe animal came chasing down the\nslope, and stopped ten feet away to\ncrouch and bark frantically at the\nshadow in the gloom. He knew the\ndog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky\nboy\u2014here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dog stopped barking, sniffed,\ntrotted closer, and went\n\"\n  <i>\n   Rrrooff!\n  </i>\n  \" Then he started sniffing\nsuspiciously again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he\nwhispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dog came forward silently,\nsniffed his hand, and whined in\nrecognition. Then he trotted around\nHogey, panting doggy affection and\ndancing an invitation to romp. The\nman whistled from the porch. The\ndog froze, then trotted quickly back\nup the slope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the\nman on the porch said. \"Chasin'\narmadillos again, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The screen door slammed again,\nand the porch light went out.\nHogey stood there staring, unable\nto think. Somewhere beyond the\nwindow lights were\u2014his woman,\nhis son.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What the hell was a tumbler doing\nwith a woman and a son?\n </p>\n <p>\n  After perhaps a minute, he stepped\nforward again. He tripped over\na shovel, and his foot plunged into\nsomething that went\n  <i>\n   squelch\n  </i>\n  and\nswallowed the foot past the ankle.\nHe fell forward into a heap of\nsand, and his foot went deeper into\nthe sloppy wetness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lay there with his stinging\nforehead on his arms, cursing softly\nand crying. Finally he rolled\nover, pulled his foot out of the\nmess, and took off his shoes. They\nwere full of mud\u2014sticky sandy\nmud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dark world was reeling\nabout him, and the wind was dragging\nat his breath. He fell back\nagainst the sand pile and let his\nfeet sink in the mud hole and wriggled\nhis toes. He was laughing\nsoundlessly, and his face was wet\nin the wind. He couldn't think. He\ncouldn't remember where he was\nand why, and he stopped caring,\nand after a while he felt better.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The stars were swimming over\nhim, dancing crazily, and the mud\ncooled his feet, and the sand was\nsoft behind him. He saw a rocket\ngo up on a tail of flame from the\nstation, and waited for the sound of\nits blast, but he was already asleep\nwhen it came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was far past midnight when he\nbecame conscious of the dog licking\nwetly at his ear and cheek. He\npushed the animal away with a low\ncurse and mopped at the side of his\nface. He stirred, and groaned. His\nfeet were burning up! He tried to\npull them toward him, but they\nwouldn't budge. There was something\nwrong with his legs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an instant he stared wildly\naround in the night. Then he remembered\nwhere he was, closed his\neyes and shuddered. When he\nopened them again, the moon had\nemerged from behind a cloud, and\nhe could see clearly the cruel trap\ninto which he had accidentally\nstumbled. A pile of old boards, a\ncareful stack of new lumber, a\npick and shovel, a sand-pile, heaps\nof fresh-turned earth, and a concrete\nmixer\u2014well, it added up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gripped his ankles and pulled,\nbut his feet wouldn't budge. In\nsudden terror, he tried to stand up,\nbut his ankles were clutched by the\nconcrete too, and he fell back in\nthe sand with a low moan. He lay\nstill for several minutes, considering\ncarefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pulled at his left foot. It was\nlocked in a vise. He tugged even\nmore desperately at his right foot.\nIt was equally immovable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat up with a whimper and\nclawed at the rough concrete until\nhis nails tore and his fingertips\nbled. The surface still felt damp,\nbut it had hardened while he slept.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat there stunned until Hooky\nbegan licking at his scuffed fingers.\nHe shouldered the dog away, and\ndug his hands into the sand-pile to\nstop the bleeding. Hooky licked at\nhis face, panting love.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get away!\" he croaked savagely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dog whined softly, trotted\na short distance away, circled, and\ncame back to crouch down in the\nsand directly before Hogey, inching\nforward experimentally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hogey gripped fistfuls of the dry\nsand and cursed between his teeth,\nwhile his eyes wandered over the\nsky. They came to rest on the sliver\nof light\u2014the space station\u2014rising\nin the west, floating out in Big Bottomless\nwhere the gang was\u2014Nichols\nand Guerrera and Lavrenti\nand Fats. And he wasn't forgetting\nKeesey, the rookie who'd replaced\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Keesey would have a rough time\nfor a while\u2014rough as a cob. The pit\nwas no playground. The first time\nyou went out of the station in a\nsuit, the pit got you. Everything\nwas falling, and you fell, with it.\nEverything. The skeletons of steel,\nthe tire-shaped station, the spheres\nand docks and nightmare shapes\u2014all\ntied together by umbilical cables\nand flexible tubes. Like some crazy\nsea-thing they seemed, floating in a\nblack ocean with its tentacles bound\ntogether by drifting strands in the\ndark tide that bore it.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Everything was pain-bright or\ndead black, and it wheeled around\nyou, and you went nuts trying to\nfigure which way was down. In fact,\nit took you months to teach your\nbody that\n  <i>\n   all\n  </i>\n  ways were down and\nthat the pit was bottomless.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He became conscious of a plaintive\nsound in the wind, and froze to\nlisten.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a baby crying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was nearly a minute before he\ngot the significance of it. It hit him\nwhere he lived, and he began jerking\nfrantically at his encased feet\nand sobbing low in his throat.\nThey'd hear him if he kept that up.\nHe stopped and covered his ears to\nclose out the cry of his firstborn. A\nlight went on in the house, and\nwhen it went off again, the infant's\ncry had ceased.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another rocket went up from the\nstation, and he cursed it. Space was\na disease, and he had it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Help!\" he cried out suddenly.\n\"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knew he was yelling hysterically\nat the sky and fighting the relentless\nconcrete that clutched his\nfeet, and after a moment he stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The light was on in the house\nagain, and he heard faint sounds.\nThe stirring-about woke the baby\nagain, and once more the infant's\nwail came on the breeze.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Make the kid shut up, make the\nkid shut up ...\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But that was no good. It wasn't\nthe kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's\nfault. No fathers allowed in space,\nthey said, but it wasn't their fault\neither. They were right, and he had\nonly himself to blame. The kid was\nan accident, but that didn't change\nanything. Not a thing in the world.\nIt remained a tragedy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tumbler had no business with a\nfamily, but what was a man going\nto do? Take a skinning knife, boy,\nand make yourself a eunuch. But\nthat was no good either. They needed\nbulls out there in the pit, not\nsteers. And when a man came down\nfrom a year's hitch, what was he\ngoing to do? Live in a lonely shack\nand read books for kicks? Because\nyou were a man, you sought out a\nwoman. And because she was a\nwoman, she got a kid, and that was\nthe end of it. It was nobody's fault,\nnobody's at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared at the red eye of Mars\nlow in the southwest. They were\nrunning out there now, and next\nyear he would have been on the\nlong long run ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there was no use thinking\nabout it. Next year and the years\nafter belonged to\n  <i>\n   little\n  </i>\n  Hogey.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat there with his feet locked\nin the solid concrete of the footing,\nstaring out into Big Bottomless\nwhile his son's cry came from the\nhouse and the Hauptman menfolk\ncame wading through the tall grass\nin search of someone who had cried\nout. His feet were stuck tight, and\nhe wouldn't ever get them out. He\nwas sobbing softly when they found\nhim.\n </p>\n <b>\n  Transcriber's Note:\n </b>\n This etext was produced from\n <i>\n  Fantastic Universe\n </i>\n September 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n</pre>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "109", "uid": "03fb5c08d15043bea2e082d4310c1556", "response_text": "This story follows the protagonist, Hogey Parker\u2019s, journey in heading back home after a long stint in space. His identity leans heavily on being a spacer - or a tumbler - with distinguishing sunburned marks and glare-blinded eyes. Parker is accompanied by a bottle of gin, and with it, stumbles onto a bus. In his drunken ramblings and stumblings - attributed by himself to him being a spaceman - Hogey creates a ruckus on the bus and disturbs its passengers. Fellow passengers give him allowances as he\u2019s a spaceman and help him out. \n\nThroughout his journey, he is helped by various characters who further progress his journey back home. After being dropped off, the bus driver helps him across the road, where he is later then picked up by a farmer who drops Hogey off even closer to his farmhouse. In between, Hogey constantly looks up at the Big Bottomless space and thinks about his time in space with particular feelings of resentment and anger - one towards the sun for blinding him and another towards the rookie that replaced him. After finally making it close to his farmhouse, he sneaks through the grass past the fence and encounters the dog, who he quickly shushes when one of his wife\u2019s brothers comes out to investigate the noise. Staring at his wife and son through the house, he stumbles into wet concrete and quickly becomes stuck in the sand as it dries. Despite his best efforts he is unable to claw himself out. At the end of the story, his cries at being stuck in the concrete echo at the same time the cries of his son as the Hauptmann men find him, stuck. \n"}, {"worker_id": "112", "uid": "1fb8519228cd420c9a75934505b9d7b1", "response_text": "Big Hogey Parker, a tumbler who comes back to Earth from his nine-month stay in the space, can hardly behave appropriately on the bus because of his unaccustomedness to the gravity and the drunkenness. He harasses and annoys the passengers on the bus, gets warned by the driver, and sleeps on the rear seat of the bus. After the bus stop at Caine\u2019s junction, the bus driver helps him get out of the bus and safely cross the road. While crossing the road, Hogey talks about the importance of family and learns that the driver has two daughters. After crossing the road, the driver asks whether someone will come and pick Hogey up, but Hogey tells him that he is a week late and nobody will come. The driver tells him to wait for a car and leaves. Hogey stares at the sun while waiting, feeling unfamiliar with the gravity.\n\nHogey starts to lurch in the middle of the road. A car almost hits him when he fails to control his balance. A man comes out of the car and shouts at him. The man realizes that Hogey is Marie\u2019s husband through the conversation, so he drives Hogey to a place near Marie\u2019s house. Hogey takes a nap in the grass near the ditch until the night. He swallows a few gins, checks the time with the star's position in the sky as he pawns his watch in the poker game that he lost all of the money, and walks toward the house. He is afraid of facing his wife and son as he lost all the money in a poker game two weeks ago after his wife had waited for him for so long to do all the space travel to earn money. He wants to run away. He walks through the fence, trampling through some boards when the dog barks. He hides in the shadow of the peach tree when Marie\u2019s brother comes out to check. The dog comes at him, and Hogey calms the dog, waiting until the man goes inside the house. When Hogey keeps walking, he steps into a concrete mixer with sand and falls. He takes off his shoes and puts his bare feet back in the muddy sand. Laying on the sand, Hogey falls asleep. Past midnight, he gets awakened by the dog's licking, finding his feet stuck in the concrete. Reflecting on his time in the space and the people there, Hogey feels desperate. Suddenly, he hears his son cry. The cry brings Hogey\u2019s consciousness back from the space to where he is, and the significance of his family strikes him. He calls out loud for help and sobs with his feet stuck tight.

When the bus reaches his stop, Hogey clumsily gets off the bus.

The man asks if somebody is supposed to meet Big Hogey, but he says that it is a surprise for everybody. He is redirected to sit at the culvert, but gravity makes it difficult for him to walk. As the sun sets, Hogey stares at it because he hates it for what it truly is and what it did to his eyes. A burly farmer angrily confronts him when he stumbles down the road again, but he reveals that he is married to Marie Hauptman. They offer to drop him off at the area near Hauptman's road, and Hogey finds himself too tired to go on because it is twilight. When he awakes again, it is night time. He takes another sip of his gin and decides how the meeting will go. Hogey is worried about the money, especially since he has gone on six hitches in space with the promise that each one would be his last one. As he goes near the house, a dog suddenly comes out and barks. One of Marie\u2019s brothers comes out to investigate the situation too, but he finds nothing and returns home with the dog. He tries to think about why a tumbler like him would be married with a son, and he finds both his feet losing the strength to move. The dog, Hooky, comes up to greet him again, but he angrily sends it away. Hogey thinks back to his crew, and a baby begins to cry suddenly. He yells for help, and the lights come on again because the baby begins to cry more. The kid had been an accident, and he knows that a tumblr has no business with a family. However, there is nobody to blame for this. Big Hogey sits with his foot locked in the solid concrete and sobs when the rest of the men find him.

He insists that he has to become a hoofer, but refuses to, and at the end of the story even denounces his wife and child.

Extensive research did not uncover\nany evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 65%;\"/>\n <hr style=\"width: 65%;\"/>\n Ed had always been a practical man, when he saw something was\nwrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw\n <i>\n  it\n </i>\n hanging in the\ntown square.\n <p>\n  Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car\nout and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His\nback and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and\nwheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done\nokay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a body. A human body.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Why?\n  </i>\n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n </p>\n <p>\n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He must be sick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Or drunk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me.\nBack there\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through\ntraffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the\nseat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's here in Pikeville?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen\nto me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where?\" Loyce echoed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In the\n  <i>\n   basement\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame.\nWhy? What has that to do with\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Was anybody else down there with you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from\none heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flicked across his face, wild hope.\n\"You mean because I was down there I missed\u2014the explanation? I didn't\nget in on it? Like everybody else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed\nthe explanation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then it's official? The body\u2014it's\n  <i>\n   supposed\n  </i>\n  to be hanging there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep\nend. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like\nthe Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two cops said nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n  <i>\n   That\n  </i>\n  was the strange part.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Them?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And\u2014something else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n  <i>\n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n  </i>\n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool\nof scummy water.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the\nCity Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of\nsome kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest\u2014and then crawled\ncrab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he\nshuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the\nCity Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of\nthe building and halting for a moment before going on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Were there more of them?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm\nweren't men. They were alien\u2014from some other world, some other\ndimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the\nuniverse. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm\nof being.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved\ntoward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter\nthe City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight,\nclutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly\nfluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and\ncame to rest among them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves\nas men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration.\nMimicry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The\nalley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe\ndarkness made no difference to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and\nwomen flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting\ngroups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the\nevening gloom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the\nbus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A\nmoment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Loyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired\nfaces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them\npaid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats,\njiggling with the motion of the bus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the\nsports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A\nbusinessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a\npackage on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white angora sweater.\nGazing absently ahead of her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A high school boy in jeans and black jacket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with\npackages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to\ntheir families. To dinner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Going home\u2014with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask\nof an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their\ntown, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in\nhis cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked.\nThey had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe there were others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a\nmistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had\npassed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down.\nApparently their power-zone was limited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his\nchain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache.\nWell-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small\nhands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly\naway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce tensed. One of\n  <i>\n   them\n  </i>\n  ? Or\u2014another they had missed?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever.\nShrewd. A man too shrewd for them\u2014or one of the things itself, an alien\ninsect from beyond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into\nthe box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second\nsomething passed between them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A look rich with meaning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step\ndown into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber\ndoor swung open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. \"What the hell\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A\nresidential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him,\nthe bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet.\nThey were coming after him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against\nthe curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness.\nDesperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid\ndown again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in\nthe gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed\nbefore him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The\nman screamed and tried to roll away. \"\n  <i>\n   Stop!\n  </i>\n  For God's sake listen\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and\ndissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others\nwere there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk,\nup a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were\nbending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed\nman who had come after him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Had he made a mistake?\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out\u2014away from\nthem. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between\ntheir world and his.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Ed!\" Janet Loyce backed away nervously. \"What is it? What\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ed Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room.\n\"Pull down the shades. Quick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Janet moved toward the window. \"But\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What's\nhappened? You look so strange. Why are you home?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ed locked the front door. He prowled around the house, into the kitchen.\nFrom the drawer under the sink he slid out the big butcher knife and ran\nhis finger along it. Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living\nroom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"I don't have much time. They know I escaped\nand they'll be looking for me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Escaped?\" Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. \"Who?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The town has been taken over. They're in control. I've got it pretty\nwell figured out. They started at the top, at the City Hall and police\ndepartment. What they did with the\n  <i>\n   real\n  </i>\n  humans they\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you talking about?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've been invaded. From some other universe, some other dimension.\nThey're insects. Mimicry. And more. Power to control minds. Your mind.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My mind?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Their entrance is\n  <i>\n   here\n  </i>\n  , in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you.\nThe whole town\u2014except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful\nenemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're\nlimited! They can make mistakes!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Janet shook her head. \"I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement I'd be\nlike all the rest of you.\" Loyce peered out the window. \"But I can't\nstand here talking. Get your coat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My coat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We've got to get help.\nFight this thing. They\n  <i>\n   can\n  </i>\n  be beaten. They're not infallible. It's\ngoing to be close\u2014but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!\" He grabbed\nher arm roughly. \"Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving.\nDon't stop to pack. There's no time for that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  White-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat.\n\"Where are we going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the\nfloor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. \"They'll have the\nhighway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got\nonto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about\nit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The old Ranch Road? Good Lord\u2014it's completely closed. Nobody's\nsupposed to drive over it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know.\" Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. \"That's our best\nchance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of\ngas, isn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Janet was dazed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon.\" Janet moved toward\nthe stairs. \"Ed, I\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Call the twins!\" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing\nstirred. No sign of life. All right so far.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on downstairs,\" Janet called in a wavering voice. \"We're\u2014going\nout for awhile.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now?\" Tommy's voice came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hurry up,\" Ed barked. \"Get down here, both of you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tommy appeared at the top of the stairs. \"I was doing my home work.\nWe're starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don't get this done\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can forget about fractions.\" Ed grabbed his son as he came down the\nstairs and propelled him toward the door. \"Where's Jim?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's coming.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jim started slowly down the stairs. \"What's up, Dad?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're going for a ride.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A ride? Where?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ed turned to Janet. \"We'll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn\nit on.\" He pushed her toward the set. \"So they'll think we're still\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out.\nSickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of\nmotion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy.\nIt was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse\u2014the thing hurtling at him,\ncold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow\nT-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange\nhalf-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  A stinger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce\nrolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as\nstatues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again.\nThis time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It\nbounced against the wall and fluttered down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien\nmind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his\nown, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien presence,\nsettling over him\u2014and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a\nbroken heap on the rug.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of\nsome kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy.... He closed his mind\ntight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his\nknife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still,\nneither of them moving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It\nwas ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and\nopen fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and\nson. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness\ntoward the edge of town.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loyce halted, gasping for\nbreath, swaying back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing\nwas torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled.\nTen miles\u2014on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night.\nHis shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly\nexhausted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But ahead of him lay Oak Grove.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and\nfell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything\nreceded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from\nPikeville.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in\nwonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a\ngasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens\npecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up\nto the station. \"Thank God.\" He caught hold of the wall. \"I didn't think\nI was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear\nthem buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened?\" the attendant demanded. \"You in a wreck? A hold-up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce shook his head wearily. \"They have the whole town. The City Hall\nand the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the\nfirst thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them\nhovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond\nthem. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun\ncame up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The attendant licked his lip nervously. \"You're out of your head. I\nbetter get a doctor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get me into Oak Grove,\" Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel.\n\"We've got to get started\u2014cleaning them out. Got to get started right\naway.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had\nfinished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet.\nHe stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his\ncigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\"\nhe said abruptly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A long time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why do you say that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why defeated?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n  <i>\n   Why?\n  </i>\n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n  <i>\n   Bait.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n  <i>\n   expected\n  </i>\n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n  <i>\n   Who was the\nman?\n  </i>\n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort. A telephone pole\u2014and a rope! \"Right this way,\"\nthe Commissioner said, smiling coldly.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came\nup out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and\ncoat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were\nthere, hurrying home to dinner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good night,\" the guard said, locking the door after him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good night,\" Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street\ntoward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the\nvault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there\nwas room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The\nstreet was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around\u2014and froze.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large\nand shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What the hell was it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and\nhungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner\ntable. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous\nand ugly. The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew\nhim on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made\nhim uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened\u2014and fascinated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.\n </p>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "112", "uid": "5a9630061ba54e72a1fd16211118e22a", "response_text": "Edward Loyce spends the whole day repairing the foundation. When he drives past the town park, he sees a thing hanging under the lamppost. He realizes that it\u2019s a hanging human. Ed is frightened because of the hanged body and because everyone seems to not care about it. People walk past and ignore it. Ed tells the owners of other shops, trying to figure out the situation. However, both the owners think it is normal. After realizing he is the only one who feels strange, Ed gets closer to the hanged body, noticing that it\u2019s a stranger. He bumps into Jenkins, a stationary clerk. Through the conversation with Jenkins and the jewelry store owner, he realizes that he is the only normal person in the town. He shouts to get the police, makes his way through the crowd, and finally gets into the police\u2019s car.\n\nWhen he tries to understand the situation from the police, he realizes that the police are fake because he knows every cop in the town. He escapes from the fake police. When he gets closer to the police station, he sees a swarm of alien flies landing on the roof of City Hall and flying inside of the building, disguising themselves as men coming out of the City Hall. Ed realizes that they are aliens from other dimensions trying to control the humans and already control the minds of town people, except for him, as he escapes from it when repairing the foundation. He cautiously leaves and takes the bus. People on the bus are mind-controlled. A man with a book is looking at him, and Ed guesses the identity of the seemingly mind-clear man. When another older man ascends the bus and looks at the man with the book, Ed realizes the strangeness and escapes from the bus. Two men come after Ed, and Ed kills the man with the book and runs away. A doubt about killing the wrong person flashes through his mind, but he has no time to think.\n\nHe tells his wife to get ready to leave when he gets home. He picks up a butcher knife and explains everything to his wife. When the twins come down, he sees a baby alien fly come toward him. Ed kills the alien, abandons his dazed wife and child, and flees. He runs ten miles towards Oak Grove. He explains everything to the Commissioner. The Commissioner records and agrees with his saying. Ed talks about his theory of the alien, but he cannot figure out the purpose of the hanged body. Finally, the Commissioner tells him that it is bait to lure people like him who escape successfully. Ed is frightened and realizes that he will be hanged in Oak Grove, just like the hanged body in Pikeville.

As he brings his car around, he realizes that it is a human body. Loyce tells his co-workers Don Fergusson and Jack Potter about the body, but they seem untroubled about it. Nobody pays attention to the body, and Loyce feels sick. He bumps into Jenkins and Margaret Henderson, both who assume that he is sick because of his reactions. Two cops show up, and they tell him that he missed the announcement earlier today. As he gets into the police car, he realizes that they weren\u2019t cops in Pikeville. Loyce manages to get away, stopping at the entrance of an alley. He heads towards the City Hall and sees fluttering shapes from the sky. The shapes are similar to giant insects with wings, and he wonders if there are more. Loyce realizes that they are aliens with the ability to change into man, and he boards a bus to get out of the area. Everyone seems fairly normal, but he notices a man watching him with shrewd eyes. He rushes out of the bus, and the man follows him. Loyce strikes the man with a rock and runs away as other people begin to gather. Janet asks what is happening when he returns him, and he tells her that the entire town is under control of the aliens now. The twins are called down, as Loyce tells him that they are going on a ride. Suddenly, there is a buzz and one of the aliens that bears a resemblance to Jimmy hurls itself at him. Loyce stabs it, realizing that his wife and other son are also controlled because of how expressionless they are. Eventually, he reaches Oak Grove and talks to the Commissioner. The Commissioner explains that he thinks this has been going on for a long time, and Loyce thinks about the man he accidentally killed. It turns out that the dead man was bait to draw out who had escaped, and the Commissioner tells him to come along as there is no time to waste.

Loyce is shocked and starts asking his salesman Don Fergusson about the body but gets an indefinite answer. Jack Potter, a shoe shop\u2019s employee, also calmly states that there has to be some valid reason behind it. Don goes back to work, surprisingly unbothered. Ed walks to the park to look at the dead man: not a local, his skin is cut gouged. Ed then meets a clerk named Jenkins, who asks why Ed looks sick. Loyce becomes hysterical, and people start gathering around him, wondering why someone is screaming. Two cops detain him and decide to drive Ed to the Hall of Justice. They start asking questions: his name, where he was during the day. Ed knows they are not real policemen - he knows all the cops of Pikeville - and eventually jumps out of the car when it slows down. He runs away and then sees a splotch of darkness above the City Hall and some alien figures coming through this slit. They can disguise themselves as men. He gets on the bus and inspects the other passengers - they seem to be under the influence of the alien creatures. Two men look at Ed with suspicion, and he quickly gets off the bus.

His younger son seems to be under the control of a small alien. Ed stabs the creature, killing it. His wife and the other son are not reacting - they are subservient to the aliens, too. Ed runs away alone. He gets to a patrol station after crawling and limping for ten miles. The station\u2019s attendant hears Ed\u2019s story and looks confused. Loyce asks the man to get him to Oak Grove. Later, he tells his story to the Commissioner of Oak Grove, the officer believes him. Ed suggests that these creatures have been inhabiting the planet\u2019s towns for a long time. He thinks the Jewish people defeated them and showed it in the Bible, illustrating Beelzebub as a giant fly, an alien insect.

He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  With Jacobs and Anhauser and the remainder of the crew of the ship,\n  <i>\n   Mars V\n  </i>\n  , seven judges sat in a semi-circle and Bruce stood there in\nfront of them for the inquest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the middle of the half-moon of inquisition, with his long legs\nstretched out and his hands folded on his belly, sat Captain Terrence.\nHis uniform was black. On his arm was the silver fist insignia of the\nConqueror Corps. Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there\nwas no emotion at all on her trim, neat face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered her as she had been years ago, but at the moment he\nwasn't looking very hard to see anything on her face. It was too late.\nThey had gotten her young and it was too late.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Terrence's big, square face frowned a little. Bruce was aware suddenly\nof the sound of the bleak, never-ending wind against the plastilene\nshelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes that had come to him in\nhis dreams, the voices that had called to him, and how disappointed he\nhad been when he woke from them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is a mere formality,\" Terrence finally said, \"since we all know\nyou killed Lieutenant Doran a few hours ago. Marsha saw you kill him.\nWhatever you say goes on the record, of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For whom?\" Bruce asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of question is that? For the authorities on Earth when we\nget back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When you get back? Like the crews of those other four ships out\nthere?\" Bruce laughed without much humor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Terrence rubbed a palm across his lips, dropped the hand quickly again\nto his belly. \"You want to make a statement or not? You shot Doran in\nthe head with a rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted\nenough of my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior.\nThis is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've said too\nmuch, and done too much. Freedom doesn't allow you to go around killing\nfellow crew-members!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any idea that there was any democracy or freedom left died on Venus,\"\nBruce said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now we get another lecture!\" Terrence exploded. He leaned forward.\n\"You're sick, Bruce. They did a bad psych job on you. They should never\nhave sent you on this trip. We need strength, all the strength we can\nfind. You don't belong here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" Bruce agreed indifferently. \"I was drafted for this trip. I\ntold them I shouldn't be brought along. I said I didn't want any part\nof it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because you're afraid. You're not Conqueror material. That's why you\nbacked down when we all voted to climb the mountain. And what the devil\ndoes Venus\u2014?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Max Drexel's freckles slipped into the creases across his high\nforehead. \"Haven't you heard him expounding on the injustice done to\nthe Venusian aborigines, Captain? If you haven't, you aren't thoroughly\neducated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I haven't heard it,\" Terrence admitted. \"What injustice?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce said, \"I guess it couldn't really be considered an injustice\nany longer. Values have changed too much. Doran and I were part of the\ncrew of that first ship to hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One\nof the New Era's more infamous dates. Drexel says the Venusians were\naborigines. No one ever got a chance to find out. We ran into this\nvillage. No one knows how old it was. There were intelligent beings\nthere. One community left on the whole planet, maybe a few thousand\ninhabitants. They made their last mistake when they came out to greet\nus. Without even an attempt at communication, they were wiped out. The\nvillage was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce felt the old weakness coming into his knees, the sweat beginning\nto run down his face. He took a deep breath and stood there before the\ncold nihilistic stares of fourteen eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Bruce said. \"I apologize. None of you know what I'm talking\nabout.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Terrence nodded. \"You're psycho. It's as simple as that. They pick the\nmost capable for these conquests. Even the flights are processes of\nelimination. Eventually we get the very best, the most resilient, the\nreal conquering blood. You just don't pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you\nthink gives you the right to stand here in judgment against the laws\nof the whole Solar System?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are plenty on Earth who agree with me,\" Bruce said. \"I can say\nwhat I think now because you can't do more than kill me and you'll do\nthat regardless....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And theirs. They\nhad established a kind of final totalitarianism since the New Era. The\npsychologists, the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had done that. If you didn't\nwant to be reconditioned to fit into the social machine like a human\nvacuum tube, you kept your mouth shut. And for many, when the mouth was\nkept shut long enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted\nto open the mouth for in the first place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A minority in both segments of a world split into two factions.\nBoth had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, for\ncenturies, clung to old ideas of freedom, democracy, self-determinism,\nindividualism. To most, the words had no meaning now. It was a question\nof which set of conquering heroes could conquer the most space first.\nSo far, only Venus had fallen. They had done a good, thorough job\nthere. Four ships had come to Mars and their crews had disappeared.\nThis was the fifth attempt\u2014\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and\nwhen he shot the\u2014\" Bruce hesitated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What? When he shot what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone laughed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n  <i>\n   imagined\n  </i>\n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  see anything?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of service?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to\nworry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence\nwas saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His\ndream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had\nleft it, and it was the same\u2014allowing even for the time difference\nnecessitated by his periods of sleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names:\nPietro, Marlene, Helene.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to\nhim all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could\nalso talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense.\nConsistently, they made sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green\nvalleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing\ntheir branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there\nwere pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them\nthat were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  '\n  <i>\n   ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting,\nshadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the\ndelirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love\u2014and all our\nown!\u2014than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known....\n  </i>\n  '\n </p>\n <p>\n  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the\ndreams.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would\nlook out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing\nbut seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again.\nThe dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he\ncouldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would\ndie. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into\nhimself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one\ncompensation\u2014he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them\nwho had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way\nacross the Cosmos.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him\nmuch more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He\ncould switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bruce\u2014Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure\nto be five hundred thousand feet! It\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  impossible. We keep climbing\nand now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is\ngoing up and up\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the\nmatter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps\nlaughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it.\nWomen don't have real guts.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled\nsoftly at the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Marsha,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bruce\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember\nhow you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I\nnever thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't\nmatter....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper.\n\"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and\nhysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish\nI were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that?\nI really love you, after all. After all....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest\nmountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and\nwarm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What\nare you doing\u2014reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was\nthat, Bruce\u2014that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last\nnight before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the\nmike. He got through to her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n </p>\n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n <p>\n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into\nany signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our\ndestiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a\nthousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this\nworld\u2014the top of\n  <i>\n   everything\n  </i>\n  . The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no mountain.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For one shivery moment he knew fear. And then the fear went away, and\nhe was ashamed of what he had felt. What he had feared was gone now,\nand he knew it was gone for good and he would never have to fear it\nagain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look here, Bruce. I wondered how long it would take to get it through\nthat thick poetic head of yours!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get what?\" He began to suspect what it was all about now, but he\nwasn't quite sure yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Smoke?\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took one of the cigarettes and she lighted it for him and put the\nlighter back into her pocket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's real nice here,\" she said. \"Isn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess it's about perfect.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It'll be easy. Staying here, I mean. We won't be going to Earth ever\nagain, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't\n  <i>\n   know\n  </i>\n  that, but I didn't\n  <i>\n   think\n  </i>\n  we ever would again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We wouldn't want to anyway, would we, Bruce?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kept on looking at the place where the mountain had been. Or maybe\nit still was; he couldn't make up his mind yet. Which was and which was\nnot? That barren icy world without life, or this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"'\n  <i>\n   Is all that we see or seem\n  </i>\n  ,'\" he whispered, half to himself, \"'\n  <i>\n   but\na dream within a dream?\n  </i>\n  '\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She laughed softly. \"Poe was ahead of his time,\" she said. \"You still\ndon't get it, do you? You don't know what's been happening?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe I don't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She shrugged, and looked in the direction of the ships. \"Poor guys. I\ncan't feel much hatred toward them now. The Martians give you a lot of\nunderstanding of the human mind\u2014after they've accepted you, and after\nyou've lived with them awhile. But the mountain climbers\u2014we can see\nnow\u2014it's just luck, chance, we weren't like them. A deviant is a child\nof chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Bruce said. \"There's a lot of people like us on Earth, but\nthey'll never get the chance\u2014the chance we seem to have here, to live\ndecently....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're beginning to see now which was the dream,\" she said and\nsmiled. \"But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth will get their\nchance, too, one of these fine days. The Conquerors aren't getting far.\nVenus, and then Mars, and Mars is where they stop. They'll keep coming\nhere and climbing the mountain and finally there won't be any more. It\nwon't take so long.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She rose to her toes and waved and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and Marlene\nwalking hand in hand up the other side of the canal. They waved back\nand called and then pushed off into the water in a small boat, and\ndrifted away and out of sight around a gentle turn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She took his arm and they walked along the canal toward where the\nmountain had been, or still was\u2014he didn't know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A quarter of a mile beyond the canal, he saw the high mound of red,\nnaked hill, corroded and ugly, rising up like a scar of the surrounding\ngreen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She wasn't smiling now.

A day before the ascent Bruce is reading Byron and thinking about his bizarre dreams. Then we see an inquest. With all the crew members listening, Terrence interrogates Bruce and asks why he shot Doran. Bruce reminds the crew about the genocide of the Venusian aborigines: five years ago, he and Doran were part of the crew of the first ship that landed on Venus; these explorers wiped out the entire Venusian community. Terrence claims that Bruce is mentally ill and doesn\u2019t have the real conquering blood. The captain understands the young man doesn\u2019t believe in the philosophy of conquering and remains faithful to the old ideas of democracy and freedom. Bruce then explains that Marsha and Doran woke him up after a bizarre dream, and he immediately saw something or someone in the window. When Doran saw the creature, he left the room, and Bruce heard his rifle go off. Infuriated, Bruce killed the man. \n\nStromberg deems Bruce a delusional schizophrenic and says that Doran probably imagined the creature, too. Instead of punishing the man by executing him, Terrence orders Bruce to write down everything they report via radio while they are climbing. He stays by the radio, eats what they left for him, and sometimes sleeps. Eventually, Terrence reports that the mountain is way higher than they anticipated - 45 00 feet. Later, he screams that he just killed Anhauser for dissent. The captain speaks of their great conquest, and Bruce sometimes replies to prove he's still writing down everything. His dreams become more realistic and he seems to see some crew members of the previous expeditions: Pietro, Marlene, and Helene. Terrence reports that they are at an altitude of five hundred thousand feet and later adds that Marsha is dying. She says she loves Bruce, and he recites a poem for her. Terrence later crazily speaks about toppling the Solar system but soon stops reporting. Bruce turns off the radio. The exterior of the ship changes - now he sees a small town and the grandiose mountain vanished. Not sure if it\u2019s a dream or not, he approaches Helene, who eventually explains that the Martians wanted to stop the human conquerors. They decided to create an illusion of an infinitely high mountain, and the colonists felt an uncontrollable urge to climb it.

Everybody meets with Captain Terrence and Marsha Rennels, where they discuss Bruce killing Lieutenant Doran. Bruce tries to argue his way, but Terrence believes that he should never have been sent because of his bad mental state. Max Drexel considers him a crackpot idealist, but Bruce says that the first thing that the original travelers did to the Venusian village was destroy it completely. Bruce stops himself from arguing more because the New Era had only ushered final totalitarianism. Terrence asks him again why he shot Doran, and Bruce begins talking about the realistic dreams he has of the other crew members who never made it back to Earth.

Bruce is sat in front of his crew members, with Captain Terrence taking the lead, for an inquest. He has shot a fellow crew member, Lieutenant Doran, supposedly without provocation. He is set on trial for a mere formality - his fate of execution already decided - to determine his motivations behind the killing. Bruce proclaims that there are injustices aboard the crew. In particular, he disagrees with the crew and Earth's dogged desire to conquest, which Doran embodied wholeheartedly. \nBruce describes he saw a figure or a shadow out the window of their shelter that could've blurred between dream and reality. Doran had turned and saw it too, only to rush out and shoot at it, after which Bruce then killed him. It was then decided that because the rest of the crew were going to climb the mountain, instead of execution being Bruce's fate, he would remain back to record their notes over the radio. \n\nAs the crew went on their climb, Bruce sat back and drifted between sedative sleeping and dreams. The crew began to climb beyond the mountain's estimated peak of 45,000 feet. At 60,000 feet, Terrence reported that he killed Anhauser as he was dissenting, wanting to go back down the mountain. At 500,000 feet, Terrence comes back on the radio to report that Marsha is dying.

As Terrence's voice breaks off into undistinguishable yells, he looked out the shelter's window to find that the previously red and barren landscape had changed into the lush landscape of his dreams. He sees Helene - one of the girls - and she tells him what's been going on. It turns out that the Martians had purposefully imaged Mars to appear red and barren and set up the mountain as a test for the humans. They had found that humans had an undeterred desire for conquest that incorporated no values of morality or humane-ness. As a result, only those who didn't follow this blind conquest like Bruce, Helene, and the other girl and boy are rewarded by the true landscape of Mars which is plentiful, lush, and inhabitable. While listening to Helene, they reach the mountain. There lies the bodies of the previous crew members who climbed the mountain, including that of Marsha's.

But who was his enemy?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  In 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was\nknown as fog. In 2149, it had become far more frequent, and was known\nas smog. By 2349, it was fog again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it.\nSomewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on the\ncracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks;\nwhat remained of the gutted concrete office building from which he\npeered was fire-proof.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders broke\nin from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while\nthe soldiers went out to fight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He felt\nalmost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted in\nthat grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, \"The soldiers\ndon't\n  <i>\n   want\n  </i>\n  little boys. The soldiers don't\n  <i>\n   want\n  </i>\n  little boys. The\nsoldiers don't\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  a little boy!\" Roddie suddenly shouted. \"I'm full-grown and\nI've never even\n  <i>\n   seen\n  </i>\n  an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder.\nShe rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse\u2014\" she chanted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that had\nhelped her over these spells. But this time, though it stopped the\nkindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wuzzums hungry?\" Molly cooed, still rocking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had\ncared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him a\nmechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He was still tinkering when the soldiers came in. While they lined up\nalong the wall, he put Molly's head back on her neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She gaped coyly at the new arrivals. \"Hello, boys,\" she simpered.\n\"Looking for a good time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie slapped her to silence, reflecting briefly that there were many\nthings he didn't know about Molly. But there was work to be done.\nCarefully he framed the ritual words she'd taught him: \"Soldiers, come\nto attention and report!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were eleven of them, six feet tall, with four limbs and eight\nextremities. They stood uniformly, the thumbs on each pair of hands\ntouching along the center line of the legs, front feet turned out at an\nangle of forty-five degrees, rear feet turned inward at thirty degrees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir,\" they chorused, \"we have met the enemy and he is ours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He inspected them. All were scratched and dented, but one in particular\nseemed badly damaged. His left arm was almost severed at the shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come here, fellow,\" Roddie said. \"Let's see if I can fix that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The soldier took a step forward, lurched suddenly, stopped, and whipped\nout a bayonet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Death to Invaders!\" he yelled, and charged crazily.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Molly stepped in front of him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You aren't being very nice to my baby,\" she murmured, and thrust her\nknitting needles into his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie jumped behind him, knocked off his helmet, and pressed a soft\nspot on his conical skull. The soldier collapsed to the floor.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Roddie salvaged and returned Molly's needles. Then he examined the\npatient, tearing him apart as a boy dismembers an alarm clock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was lucky he did. The left arm's pair of hands suddenly writhed off\nthe floor in an effort to choke him. But because the arm was detached\nat the shoulder and therefore blind, he escaped the clutching onslaught\nand could goad the reflexing hands into assaulting one another\nharmlessly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, the other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another\ncasualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into the fire. By the\ntime Roddie had hauled him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie\nswore, then decided to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces\nof the other to make a whole one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie was\nnew at his work, and took it seriously. It alarmed him to watch the\nsoldiers melt away, gradually succumbing to battle damage, shamed\nhim to see the empty ruins burn section by section as the Invaders\nrepeatedly broke through and had to be burned out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Soon there would be nothing left of the\n  <i>\n   Private Property Keep Out\n  </i>\n  that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to\nthem when driven away by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers themselves\nwould be gone. None would remain to guard the city but a few strayed\nservants like Molly, and an occasional Civil Defender.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And himself, Roddie reflected, spitting savagely into the fire. He\nmight remain. But how he fitted into the picture, he didn't know. And\nMolly, who claimed to have found him in the ruins after a fight with\nInvaders twenty years before, couldn't or wouldn't say.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, for as long as possible, Roddie decided, he'd do his duty as\nthe others did theirs\u2014single-mindedly. Eventually the soldiers might\naccept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first\naid was useful to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gave the fire a final poke and then paused, wondering if, when\nheated, his screwdriver could make an unfastened end of wire stick on\nthe grayish spot where it seemed to belong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out his new\nidea, Roddie got too close to the flames. Instantly the room filled\nwith the stench of singed hair. Roddie drew angrily back, beating out\nthe sparks in his uncut blond mane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he stood slapping his head and muttering, a deranged Civil Defense\nfirefighter popped into the doorway and covered him with carbon dioxide\nfoam.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie fled. His life-long friends were not merely wearing out, they\nwere unbearably wearing.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  In the street, even before he'd wiped off the foam, he regretted\nhis flight. The fire was back home. And here in the cold of this\nfog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble,\nthe diaper he wore felt inadequate against the pre-dawn cold. His\ncherished weapon, a magnetic tack-hammer, was chill beneath the\ndiaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended from\na string around his neck hung clammy against his chest. He stood\nirresolute on numbing bare feet, and considered returning to the more\nfamiliar bedlam.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But colder than cold was his shame at being cold. Molly never was,\nthough she knew how to keep him warm, nor were the others. Hunger,\nthirst, pain and coldness were sensations never experienced by his\nfriends. Like the growth he'd been undergoing till recently, these were\nthings of ignominy, to be hidden as far as possible from inquiring\neyes. Cold as it was, he'd have to hide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite\ncomplete. From above the fog, the moon played vaguely deceptive light\non the splinters of architecture looming toward it. Some distance off,\nan owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and\nrustle as they scampered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as\nan irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even\nin the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the\nOne who'd built him must have been an apprentice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now\nwalked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of\nhow much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock\nitself a difference to be hidden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A\nweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was\nthe levering key that opened its door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Everything\n  </i>\n  was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of\ncourse that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to\nmove the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for\nventilation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry\nout every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all\nobstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against\neverything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even\n  <i>\n   him\n  </i>\n  out\nwhen he was aflame....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling.\nHe lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the\nstreet, and felt with his feet for the top rung.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but\nsaw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could\nhave entered through the iron cover?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body\nheat, as if a large animal had recently rested there!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready\nfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the\ndarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over\nthat curving surface for identifying features.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly\nseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage\nkick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an\nunexpected voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think\nyou are?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to\nfumble for it. \"Who do you think\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  are?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  there in this raiding\nparty?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused\nsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see\nme soon enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But she'd see\n  <i>\n   him\n  </i>\n  , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n  <i>\n   were\n  </i>\n  a way over the bridge....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n  <i>\n   if\n  </i>\n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's\nassertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if\nshe felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of\nwhat the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an\nInvader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do\nany good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most\ndirect route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and\nshe began to talk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless\nto him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had\nbeen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many\ncasualties....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why do you\u2014we\u2014keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the\nsoldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and\nthey\n  <i>\n   can't\n  </i>\n  leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll\nbe plenty of young men.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever\ntell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep\nus out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our\ntools and things?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance.\nBut she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too\nclose for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder\nevery few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  here? I mean, sure, the\nothers are after tools and things, but what's\n  <i>\n   your\n  </i>\n  purpose?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said,\n\"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no\nweapon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of\nwords. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored\nand hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the\nboats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was\nbeing silly?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and\nconcrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over\nthe water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they\ncould see the beginning of the bridge approach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and\nclung to Roddie's arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back\nbelow the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a\nsoldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned\nand walked away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie\nturned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to\nhis. He grimaced and turned away his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from\nhis arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've\nhad no sleep, no food or water.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to\ndeny his own humiliating needs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care\nof you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he\nhad previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting\na pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had\ngrubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose.\nPicking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed\nan end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained\nspinach or squash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat\nbaby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you\nhappen to know where to find it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging.\n\"I've been here before.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She\nwas silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can\nwith rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the\nrubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her\nstrength.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed\nplainly that he'd given himself away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the\nsupposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as\nIda herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would\nsatisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he\nmight join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this\nenemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of\nhis watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder\nat every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for\nthis self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Except it wouldn't be\n  <i>\n   his\n  </i>\n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean.

Neither end of it was in\nsight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier\nhad ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left\nthe city, were not built to do so. But\n  <i>\n   he\n  </i>\n  was here; with luck, he\ncould capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened\nwire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted.\nNever had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar\nnon-mechanical construction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling\nas that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling\nbody of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog\nthinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last\nhundred feet to sanctuary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within\nthe tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and\nslept for several hours.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip.\nLimping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings\nthey looked out on a strange and isolated world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount\nTamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy\nwhite sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons\non a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding,\ntallest of the peaks and most forbidding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold\u2014of all the kinds of\ngold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small\nportion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed\nto have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its\ncolor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no\ninterest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes,\nRoddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which\nInvaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins\nof the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable\nover the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was\nthe advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on\nthe water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need\nto kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her\nface with scratched and bloodied hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and,\nweeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends.\nIda's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will\ncome back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\u2014but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so\nsenseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your\nfriends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men\u2014and the\ncity is ours, not theirs!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It\n  <i>\n   can't\n  </i>\n  be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those\nwho are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to\nme. Each of\n  <i>\n   us\n  </i>\n  has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be\naimless. Each of\n  <i>\n   us\n  </i>\n  helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and\nend it by destroying it.\n  <i>\n   My\n  </i>\n  people must be the true Men, because\nthey're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to\nlet you escape.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in\ncold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two?\nDon't\u2014don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet\nsomehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said\nnothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and\nkill\u2014see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the\ncity regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack\nfriends, too! Men can accomplish anything!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Scornfully she turned and looked toward the western twilight. It was\nRoddie's turn to stand and stare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Purpose!\" Ida flung at him over her shoulder. \"Logic! Women hear so\nmuch of that from men! You're a man, all right! Men\n  <i>\n   always\n  </i>\n  call it\nlogic when they want to destroy! Loyalty to your own sort, kindness,\naffection\u2014all emotional, aren't they? Not a bit logical. Emotion is\nfor creating, and it's so much more logical to destroy, isn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She whirled back toward him, advancing as if she wanted to sink her\nteeth into his throat. \"Go ahead. Get it over with\u2014if you have the\ncourage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was hard for Roddie to look away from that wrath-crimsoned face,\nbut it was even harder to keep staring into the blaze of her eyes. He\ncompromised by gazing out an opening at the gathering dusk. He thought\nfor a long time before he decided to tuck his hammer away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't reasonable to kill you now,\" he said. \"Too dark. You can't\npossibly get down that half-ruined manway tonight, so let's see how I\nfeel in the morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ida began to weep again, and Roddie found it necessary to comfort her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And by morning he knew he was a Man.\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "109", "uid": "009af7d819474772adbfce8e44e0f3bc", "response_text": "The protagonist of this story is Roddie, a young male character whose interactions with the characters around him include mechanical arms and robotic functionalities.

He cried when he realized that he was different. This emotion also made him unique. After meeting Ida, he slowly analyzes her behavioral traits and sees how similar they are. She says that he is a human being, not a robot. He believes rationality creates the superior. But Roddie knows he\u2019s not a completely rational creature - he has feelings, too. Roddie spends enough time with her to finally accept that he is a man, not a soldier. "}]}]}

After\n   <br/>\n   science, there will be ... what? The biggest,\n   <br/>\n   most staggering\n  </i>\n  , most final\n  <i>\n   fact of them all!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"But it's all predicted here! It even names this century for the next\nreshuffling of the planets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste Wolver looked up unwillingly at the book her friend Madge\nCarnap held aloft like a torch. She made out the ill-stamped title,\n  <i>\n   The Dance of the Planets\n  </i>\n  . There was no mistaking the time of\nits origin; only paper from the Twentieth Century aged to that\nparticularly nasty shade of brown. Indeed, the book seemed to Celeste\na brown old witch resurrected from the Last Age of Madness to confound\na world growing sane, and she couldn't help shrinking back a trifle\ntoward her husband Theodor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to come to her rescue. \"Only predicted in the vaguest way. As\nI understand it, Kometevsky claimed, on the basis of a lot of evidence\ndrawn from folklore, that the planets and their moons trade positions\nevery so often.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As if they were playing Going to Jerusalem, or musical chairs,\"\nCeleste chimed in, but she couldn't make it sound funny.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jupiter was supposed to have started as the outermost planet, and is\nto end up in the orbit of Mercury,\" Theodor continued. \"Well, nothing\nat all like that has happened.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it's begun,\" Madge said with conviction. \"Phobos and Deimos have\ndisappeared. You can't argue away that stubborn little fact.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was the trouble; you couldn't. Mars' two tiny moons had simply\nvanished during a period when, as was generally the case, the eyes\nof astronomy weren't on them. Just some hundred-odd cubic miles of\nrock\u2014the merest cosmic flyspecks\u2014yet they had carried away with them\nthe security of a whole world.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Looking at the lovely garden landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt\nthat in a moment the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, the\ncharmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea,\nthe sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds they\npierced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   People must have felt like this\n  </i>\n  , she thought,\n  <i>\n   when Aristarches first\nhinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet\nwas falling dizzily through space. Only it's worse for us, because they\ncouldn't see that anything had changed. We can.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You need something to cling to,\" she heard Madge say. \"Dr. Kometevsky\nwas the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this\nmight happen. I was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of\nthe man.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and\nanxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much\nworse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course, there are several more convincing alternate\nexplanations....\" Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that\nthere weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated,\nsurely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the\nDisordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance\nphrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist.\nAnd in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you\nadmitted that moons and planets might explode, or drop through unseen\nholes in space? So he ended up by taking a different tack: \"Besides, if\nPhobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been\npicked up by now by 'scope or radar.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter?\" Madge questioned.\n\"Aren't they smaller than many of the asteroids? I'm no astronomer, but\nI think' I'm right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And of course she was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She swung the book under her arm. \"Whew, it's heavy,\" she observed,\nadding in slightly scandalized tones, \"Never been microfilmed.\" She\nsmiled nervously and looked them up and down. \"Going to a party?\" she\nasked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver jacket\njustified the question, but they shook their heads.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just the normally flamboyant garb of the family,\" Celeste said,\nwhile Theodor explained, \"As it happens, we're bound on business\nconnected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically constitute\na sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes.\nAnd since a lot of varied material comes to our attention, we're\ngoing to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomical\nsleight-of-hand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Madge nodded. \"Give you something to do, at any rate. Well, I must be\noff. The Buddhist temple has lent us their place for a meeting.\" She\ngave them a woeful grin. \"See you when the Earth jumps.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor said to Celeste, \"Come on, dear. We'll be late.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Celeste didn't want to move too fast. \"You know, Teddy,\" she said\nuncomfortably, \"all this reminds me of those old myths where too much\ngood fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much\nluck, our great-grandparents missing World III and getting the World\nGovernment started a thousand years ahead of schedule. Luck like that\ncouldn't last, evidently. Maybe we've gone too fast with a lot of\nthings, like space-flight and the Deep Shaft and\u2014\" she hesitated a\nbit\u2014\"complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where\nam I to find it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In me,\" Theodor said promptly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In you?\" Celeste questioned, walking slowly. \"But you're just\none-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or\nIvan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You angry with me about something?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not. But a woman wants her source of security whole. In a\ncrisis like this, it's disturbing to have it divided.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family,\" Theodor\ntold her warmly. \"You're not suggesting, are you, that we're going to\nbe punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from\nHeaven and all that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be silly. I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling.\"\nCeleste smiled. \"I guess none of us realized how much we've come to\ndepend on the idea of unchanging scientific law. Knocks the props from\nunder you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor nodded emphatically. \"All the more reason to get a line on\nwhat's happening as quickly as possible. You know, it's fantastically\nfar-fetched, but I think the experience of persons with Extra-Sensory\nPerception may give us a clue. During the past three or four days\nthere's been a remarkable similarity in the dreams of ESPs all over the\nplanet. I'm going to present the evidence at the meeting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste looked up at him. \"So that's why Rosalind's bringing Frieda's\ndaughter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dotty is your daughter, too, and Rosalind's,\" Theodor reminded her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, just Frieda's,\" Celeste said bitterly. \"Of course you may be the\nfather. One-third of a chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor looked at her sharply, but didn't comment. \"Anyway, Dotty will\nbe there,\" he said. \"Probably asleep by now. All the ESPs have suddenly\nseemed to need more sleep.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As they talked, it had been growing darker, though the luminescence of\nthe path kept it from being bothersome. And now the cloud rack parted\nto the east, showing a single red planet low on the horizon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you know,\" Theodor said suddenly, \"that in\n  <i>\n   Gulliver's Travels\n  </i>\n  Dean Swift predicted that better telescopes would show Mars to have two\nmoons? He got the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately,\ntoo. One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and\nliterature.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop being eerie,\" Celeste said sharply. But then she went on, \"Those\nnames Phobos and Deimos\u2014they're Greek, aren't they? What do they mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor lost a step. \"Fear and Terror,\" he said unwillingly. \"Now\ndon't go taking that for an omen. Most of the mythological names of\nmajor and minor ancient gods had been taken\u2014the bodies in the Solar\nSystem are named that way, of course\u2014and these were about all that\nwere available.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was true, but it didn't comfort him much.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   I am a God\n  </i>\n  , Dotty was dreaming,\n  <i>\n   and I want to be by myself and\nthink. I and my god-friends like to keep some of our thoughts secret,\nbut the other gods have forbidden us to.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A little smile flickered across the lips of the sleeping girl, and\nthe woman in gold tights and gold-spangled jacket leaned forward\nthoughtfully. In her dignity and simplicity and straight-spined grace,\nshe was rather like a circus mother watching her sick child before she\nwent out for the trapeze act.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   I and my god-friends sail off in our great round silver boats\n  </i>\n  , Dotty\nwent on dreaming.\n  <i>\n   The other gods are angry and scared. They are\nfrightened of the thoughts we may think in secret. They follow us to\nhunt us down. There are many more of them than of us.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  As Celeste and Theodor entered the committee room, Rosalind Wolver\u2014a\nglitter of platinum against darkness\u2014came in through the opposite\ndoor and softly shut it behind her. Frieda, a fair woman in blue robes,\ngot up from the round table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste turned away with outward casualness as Theodor kissed his two\nother wives. She was pleased to note that Edmund seemed impatient too.\nA figure in close-fitting black, unrelieved except for two red arrows\nat the collar, he struck her as embodying very properly the serious,\nfateful temper of the moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took two briefcases from his vest pocket and tossed them down on the\ntable beside one of the microfilm projectors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suggest we get started without waiting for Ivan,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Frieda frowned anxiously. \"It's ten minutes since he phoned from the\nDeep Space Bar to say he was starting right away. And that's hardly a\ntwo minutes walk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rosalind instantly started toward the outside door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll check,\" she explained. \"Oh, Frieda, I've set the mike so you'll\nhear if Dotty calls.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edmund threw up his hands. \"Very well, then,\" he said and walked over,\nswitched on the picture and stared out moodily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor and Frieda got out their briefcases, switched on projectors,\nand began silently checking through their material.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste fiddled with the TV and got a newscast. But she found her eyes\ndidn't want to absorb the blocks of print that rather swiftly succeeded\neach other, so, after a few moments, she shrugged impatiently and\nswitched to audio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the noise, the others looked around at her with surprise and some\nirritation, but in a few moments they were also listening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The two rocket ships sent out from Mars Base to explore the orbital\npositions of Phobos and Deimos\u2014that is, the volume of space they'd be\noccupying if their positions had remained normal\u2014report finding masses\nof dust and larger debris. The two masses of fine debris are moving\nin the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanished\nmoons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the mass\nof material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists have\nventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation of\nthe Disintegration Hypothesis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"However, we're mighty pleased at this news here. There's a marked\nlessening of tension. The finding of the debris\u2014solid, tangible\nstuff\u2014seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma in\nwhich some of us have been tempted to plunge it. One-hundredth of the\nmoons has been found.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The rest will also be!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edmund had turned his back on the window. Frieda and Theodor had\nswitched off their projectors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a minimum\nof commotion, meeting with considerable calm the strange threat to\nthe fabric of their Solar System. Many, of course, are assembled in\nchurches and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopter\nprocessions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demanding\nthat instant preparations be made for\u2014and I quote\u2014'Earth's coming\nleap through space.' They have also formally challenged all astronomers\nto produce an explanation other than the one contained in that strange\nbook so recently conjured from oblivion,\n  <i>\n   The Dance of the Planets\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That about winds up the story for the present. There are no new\nreports from Interplanetary Radar, Astronomy, or the other rocket ships\nsearching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have any statements been\nissued by the various groups working on the problem in Astrophysics,\nCosmic Ecology, the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, and so\nforth. Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poem\nwritten even before Dr. Kometevsky's book:\n </p>\n \"This Earth is not the steadfast place\n We landsmen build upon;\n From deep to deep she varies pace,\n And while she comes is gone.\n Beneath my feet I feel\n Her smooth bulk heave and dip;\n With velvet plunge and soft upreel\n She swings and steadies to her keel\n Like a gallant, gallant ship.\"\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  While the TV voice intoned the poem, growing richer as emotion caught\nit up, Celeste looked around her at the others. Frieda, with her\ntouch of feminine helplessness showing more than ever through her\nbusiness-like poise. Theodor leaning forward from his scarlet cloak\nthrown back, smiling the half-smile with which he seemed to face even\nthe unknown. Black Edmund, masking a deep uncertainty with a strong\nshow of decisiveness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In short, her family. She knew their every quirk and foible. And yet\nnow they seemed to her a million miles away, figures seen through the\nwrong end of a telescope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Were they really a family? Strong sources of mutual strength and\nsecurity to each other? Or had they merely been playing family,\nexperimenting with their notions of complex marriage like a bunch of\nsilly adolescents? Butterflies taking advantage of good weather to\nwing together in a glamorous, artificial dance\u2014until outraged Nature\ndecided to wipe them out?\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the poem was ending, Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come\nslowly in. The Golden Woman's face was white as the paths she had been\ntreading.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just then the TV voice quickened with shock. \"News! Lunar Observatory\nOne reports that, although Jupiter is just about to pass behind the\nSun, a good coronagraph of the planet has been obtained. Checked and\nrechecked, it admits of only one interpretation, which Lunar One\nfeels duty-bound to release.\n  <i>\n   Jupiter's fourteen moons are no longer\nvisible!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The chorus of remarks with which the Wolvers would otherwise have\nreceived this was checked by one thing: the fact that Rosalind seemed\nnot to hear it. Whatever was on her mind prevented even that incredible\nstatement from penetrating.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She walked shakily to the table and put down a briefcase, one end of\nwhich was smudged with dirt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without looking at them, she said, \"Ivan left the Deep Space Bar\ntwenty minutes ago, said he was coming straight here. On my way back\nI searched the path. Midway I found this half-buried in the dirt. I\nhad to tug to get it out\u2014almost as if it had been cemented into the\nground. Do you feel how the dirt seems to be\n  <i>\n   in\n  </i>\n  the leather, as if\nit had lain for years in the grave?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  By now the others were fingering the small case of microfilms they had\nseen so many times in Ivan's competent hands. What Rosalind said was\ntrue. It had a gritty, unwholesome feel to it. Also, it felt strangely\nheavy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And see what's written on it,\" she added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They turned it over. Scrawled with white pencil in big, hasty, frantic\nletters were two words:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Going down!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The other gods\n  </i>\n  , Dotty dreamt,\n  <i>\n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've\ndone everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a\nthorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally,\nis in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions\nare being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the\nevening\u2014which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table.\nCeleste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that\nhad engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly\nabout the Deep Shaft.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five\nmiles?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes\nwent toward Ivan's briefcase.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Our trick has succeeded\n  </i>\n  , Dotty dreamt.\n  <i>\n   The other gods have passed\nour hiding place a dozen times without noticing. They search the\nUniverse for us many times in vain. They finally decide that we have\nfound a door going out of the Universe. Yet they fear us all the more.\nThey think of us as devils who will some day return through the door to\ndestroy them. So they watch everywhere. We lie quietly smiling in our\ncamouflaged boats, yet hardly daring to move or think, for fear that\nthe faintest echoes of our doings will give them a clue. Hundreds of\nmillions of years pass by. They seem to us no more than drugged hours\nin a prison.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Theodor rubbed his eyes and pushed his chair back from the table. \"We\nneed a break.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Frieda agreed wearily. \"We've gone through everything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good idea,\" Edmund said briskly. \"I think we've hit on several crucial\npoints along the way and half disentangled them from the great mass of\ninconsequential material. I'll finish up that part of the job right now\nand present my case when we're all a bit fresher. Say half an hour?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching his\ncloak over a shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going out for a drink,\" he informed them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After several hesitant seconds, Rosalind quietly followed him. Frieda\nstretched out on a couch and closed her eyes. Edmund scanned microfilms\ntirelessly, every now and then setting one aside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste watched him for a minute, then sprang up and started toward the\nroom where Dotty was asleep. But midway she stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Not my child\n  </i>\n  , she thought bitterly.\n  <i>\n   Frieda's her mother, Rosalind\nher nurse. I'm nothing at all. Just one of the husband's girl friends.\nA lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But then she straightened her shoulders and went on.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Rosalind didn't catch up with Theodor. Her footsteps were silent and\nhe never looked back along the path whose feeble white glow rose only\nknee-high, lighting a low strip of shrub and mossy tree trunk to either\nside, no more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a little chilly. She drew on her gloves, but she didn't hurry.\nIn fact, she fell farther and farther behind the dipping tail of\nhis scarlet cloak and his plodding red shoes, which seemed to move\ndisembodied, like those in the fairy tale.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When she reached the point where she had found Ivan's briefcase, she\nstopped altogether.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A breeze rustled the leaves, and, moistly brushing her cheek, brought\nforest scents of rot and mold. After a bit she began to hear the\nfurtive scurryings and scuttlings of forest creatures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked around her half-heartedly, suddenly realizing the futility\nof her quest. What clues could she hope to find in this knee-high\ntwilight? And they'd thoroughly combed the place earlier in the night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without warning, an eerie tingling went through her and she was seized\nby a horror of the cold, grainy Earth underfoot\u2014an ancestral terror\nfrom the days when men shivered at ghost stories about graves and tombs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tiny detail persisted in bulking larger and larger in her mind\u2014the\nunnaturalness of the way the Earth had impregnated the corner of Ivan's\nbriefcase, almost as if dirt and leather co-existed in the same space.\nShe remembered the queer way the partly buried briefcase had resisted\nher first tug, like a rooted plant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally\ndwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter. She roused herself\nand started forward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something held her feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were ankle-deep in the path. While she looked in fright and\nhorror, they began to sink still lower into the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She plunged frantically, trying to jerk loose. She couldn't. She had\nthe panicky feeling that the Earth had not only trapped but invaded\nher; that its molecules were creeping up between the molecules of her\nflesh; that the two were becoming one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And she was sinking faster. Now knee-deep, thigh-deep, hip-deep,\nwaist-deep. She beat at the powdery path with her hands and threw her\nbody from side to side in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in\nthe ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell. And always the\nsense of the dark, grainy tide rose inside as well as around her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She thought,\n  <i>\n   he'd just have had time to scribble that note on his\nbriefcase and toss it away.\n  </i>\n  She jerked off a glove, leaned out as\nfar as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its fingers into\nthe powdery path. Then the Earth mounted to her chin, her nose, and\ncovered her eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She expected blackness, but it was as if the light of the path stayed\nwith her, making a little glow all around. She saw roots, pebbles,\nblack rot, worn tunnels, worms. Tier on tier of them, her vision\npenetrating the solid ground. And at the same time, the knowledge that\nthese same sorts of things were coursing up through her.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  And still she continued to sink at a speed that increased, as if the\nlaw of gravitation applied to her in a diminished way. She dropped from\nblack soil through gray clay and into pale limestone.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Her tortured, rock-permeated lungs sucked at rock and drew in air. She\nwondered madly if a volume of air were falling with her through the\nstone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A glitter of quartz. The momentary openness of a foot-high cavern\nwith a trickle of water. And then she was sliding down a black basalt\ncolumn, half inside it, half inside gold-flecked ore. Then just black\nbasalt. And always faster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It grew hot, then hotter, as if she were approaching the mythical\neternal fires.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he\nsaw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the\nblue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the\ntiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could\nhardly have been fifteen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious\ndisappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These\nare thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension,\nand impulse traveling\u2014a result of the unusual stresses of the time.\nFinally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe,\nespecially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods'\nand in some way responsible for current events.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is thought\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining\ncasually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over\nfor him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced,\n\"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of\npomegranate juice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The monkeylike figure muttered, \"Scotch-and-soda,\" then turned toward\nEdmund and asked, \"And what is your reaction to all this, sir?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Theodor recognized the shrunken wrinkle-seamed face. It was Colonel\nFortescue, a military antique long retired from the Peace Patrol and\nreputed to have seen actual fighting in the Last Age of Madness. Now,\nfor some reason, the face sported a knowing smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor shrugged. Just then the TV \"big news\" light blinked blue and\nthe girl switched on audio. The Colonel winked at Theodor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... confirming the disappearance of Jupiter's moons. But two other\nutterly fantastic reports have just been received. First, Lunar\nObservatory One says that it is visually tracking fourteen small bodies\nwhich it believes may be the lost moons of Jupiter. They are moving\noutward from the Solar System at an incredible velocity and are already\nbeyond the orbit of Saturn!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Colonel said, \"Ah!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Second, Palomar reports a large number of dark bodies approaching the\nSolar System at an equally incredible velocity. They are at about twice\nthe distance of Pluto, but closing in fast! We will be on the air with\nfurther details as soon as possible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Colonel said, \"Ah-ha!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theodor stared at him. The old man's self-satisfied poise was almost\namusing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you a Kometevskyite?\" Theodor asked him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Colonel laughed. \"Of course not, my boy. Those poor people are\nfumbling in the dark. Don't you see what's happened?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Frankly, no.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Colonel leaned toward Theodor and whispered gruffly, \"The Divine\nPlan. God is a military strategist, naturally.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he lifted the scotch-and-soda in his clawlike hand and took a\nsatisfying swallow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I knew it all along, of course,\" he went on musingly, \"but this last\nnews makes it as plain as a rocket blast, at least to anyone who knows\nmilitary strategy. Look here, my boy, suppose you were commanding a\nfleet and got wind of the enemy's approach\u2014what would you do? Why,\nyou'd send your scouts and destroyers fanning out toward them. Behind\nthat screen you'd mass your heavy ships. Then\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't mean to imply\u2014\" Theodor interrupted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl behind the bar looked at them both cryptically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course I do!\" the Colonel cut in sharply. \"It's a war between the\nforces of good and evil. The bright suns and planets are on one side,\nthe dark on the other. The moons are the destroyers, Jupiter and\nSaturn are the big battleships, while we're on a heavy cruiser, I'm\nproud to say. We'll probably go into action soon. Be a corking fight,\nwhat? And all by divine strategy!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled and took another big drink. Theodor looked at him sourly.\nThe girl behind the bar polished a glass and said nothing.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Dotty suddenly began to turn and toss, and a look of terror came over\nher sleeping face. Celeste leaned forward apprehensively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The child's lips worked and Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy words:\n\"They've found out where we're hiding. They're coming to get us. No!\nPlease, no!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at\nthe same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an\nagent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an\nexpression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She\ntouched the child's hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come\nawake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in\na smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello,\" she said sleepily. \"I've been having such funny dreams.\" Then,\nafter a pause, frowning, \"I really am a god, you know. It feels very\nqueer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, dear?\" Celeste prompted uneasily. \"Shall I call Frieda?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The smile left Dotty's lips. \"Why do you act so nervous around me?\" she\nasked. \"Don't you love me, Mummy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, her\nface broke into a radiant smile. \"Of course I do, darling. I love you\nvery much.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a sudden flurry of excited voices beyond the door. Celeste\nheard her name called. She stood up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going to have to go out and talk with the others,\" she said. \"If\nyou want me, dear, just call.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Mummy.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Edmund rapped for attention. Celeste, Frieda, and Theodor glanced\naround at him. He looked more frightfully strained, they realized, than\neven they felt. His expression was a study in suppressed excitement,\nbut there were also signs of a knowledge that was almost too\noverpowering for a human being to bear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice was clipped, rapid. \"I think it's about time we stopped\nworrying about our own affairs and thought of those of the Solar\nSystem, partly because I think they have a direct bearing on the\ndisappearances of Ivan end Rosalind. As I told you, I've been sorting\nout the crucial items from the material we've been presenting. There\nare roughly four of those items, as I see it. It's rather like a\nmystery story. I wonder if, hearing those four clues, you will come to\nthe same conclusion I have.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The others nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"First, there are the latest reports from Deep Shaft, which, as\nyou know, has been sunk to investigate deep-Earth conditions. At\napproximately twenty-nine miles below the surface, the delvers have\nencountered a metallic obstruction which they have tentatively named\nthe durasphere. It resists their hardest drills, their strongest\ncorrosives. They have extended a side-tunnel at that level for a\nquarter of a mile. Delicate measurements, made possible by the\nmirror-smooth metal surface, show that the durasphere has a slight\ncurvature that is almost exactly equal to the curvature of the Earth\nitself. The suggestion is that deep borings made anywhere in the world\nwould encounter the durasphere at the same depth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Second, the movements of the moons of Mars and Jupiter, and\nparticularly the debris left behind by the moons of Mars. Granting\nPhobos and Deimos had duraspheres proportional in size to that of\nEarth, then the debris would roughly equal in amount the material in\nthose two duraspheres' rocky envelopes. The suggestion is that the\ntwo duraspheres suddenly burst from their envelopes with such titanic\nvelocity as to leave those disrupted envelopes behind.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was deadly quiet in the committee room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thirdly, the disappearances of Ivan and Rosalind, and especially\nthe baffling hint\u2014from Ivan's message in one case and Rosalind's\ndownward-pointing glove in the other\u2014that they were both somehow drawn\ninto the depths of the Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Finally, the dreams of the ESPs, which agree overwhelmingly in the\nfollowing points: A group of beings separate themselves from a godlike\nand telepathic race because they insist on maintaining a degree of\nmental privacy. They flee in great boats or ships of some sort. They\nare pursued on such a scale that there is no hiding place for them\nanywhere in the universe. In some manner they successfully camouflage\ntheir ships. Eons pass and their still-fanatical pursuers do not\npenetrate their secret. Then, suddenly, they are detected.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edmund waited. \"Do you see what I'm driving at?\" he asked hoarsely.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He could tell from their looks that the others did, but couldn't bring\nthemselves to put it into words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose it's the time-scale and the value-scale that are so hard for\nus to accept,\" he said softly. \"Much more, even, than the size-scale.\nThe thought that there are creatures in the Universe to whom the whole\ncareer of Man\u2014in fact, the whole career of life\u2014is no more than a few\nthousand or hundred thousand years. And to whom Man is no more than a\nminor stage property\u2014a trifling part of a clever job of camouflage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  This time he went on, \"Fantasy writers have at times hinted all sorts\nof odd things about the Earth\u2014that it might even be a kind of single\nliving creature, or honeycombed with inhabited caverns, and so on.\nBut I don't know that any of them have ever suggested that the Earth,\ntogether with all the planets and moons of the Solar System, might\nbe....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a whisper, Frieda finished for him, \"... a camouflaged fleet of\ngigantic spherical spaceships.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Your guess happens to be the precise truth.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At that familiar, yet dreadly unfamiliar voice, all four of them swung\ntoward the inner door. Dotty was standing there, a sleep-stupefied\nlittle girl with a blanket caught up around her and dragging behind.\nTheir own daughter. But in her eyes was a look from which they cringed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"I am a creature somewhat older than what your geologists\ncall the Archeozoic Era. I am speaking to you through a number of\ntelepathically sensitive individuals among your kind. In each case my\nthoughts suit themselves to your level of comprehension. I inhabit the\ndisguised and jetless spaceship which is your Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Celeste swayed a step forward. \"Baby....\" she implored.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dotty went on, without giving her a glance, \"It is true that we planted\nthe seeds of life on some of these planets simply as part of our\ncamouflage, just as we gave them a suitable environment for each. And\nit is true that now we must let most of that life be destroyed. Our\nhiding place has been discovered, our pursuers are upon us, and we must\nmake one last effort to escape or do battle, since we firmly believe\nthat the principle of mental privacy to which we have devoted our\nexistence is perhaps the greatest good in the whole Universe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it is not true that we look with contempt upon you. Our whole race\nis deeply devoted to life, wherever it may come into being, and it is\nour rule never to interfere with its development. That was one of\nthe reasons we made life a part of our camouflage\u2014it would make our\npursuers reluctant to examine these planets too closely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, we have always cherished you and watched your evolution with\ninterest from our hidden lairs. We may even unconsciously have shaped\nyour development in certain ways, trying constantly to educate you away\nfrom war and finally succeeding\u2014which may have given the betraying\nclue to our pursuers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your planets must be burst asunder\u2014this particular planet in the\narea of the Pacific\u2014so that we may have our last chance to escape.\nEven if we did not move, our pursuers would destroy you with us. We\ncannot invite you inside our ships\u2014not for lack of space, but because\nyou could never survive the vast accelerations to which you would be\nsubjected. You would, you see, need very special accommodations, of\nwhich we have enough only for a few.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those few we will take with us, as the seed from which a new human\nrace may\u2014if we ourselves somehow survive\u2014be born.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Rosalind and Ivan stared dumbly at each other across the egg-shaped\nsilver room, without apparent entrance or exit, in which they were\nsprawled. But their thoughts were no longer of thirty-odd mile\njourneys down through solid earth, or of how cool it was after the\nheat of the passage, or of how grotesque it was to be trapped here,\nthe fragment of a marriage. They were both listening to the voice that\nspoke inside their minds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In a few minutes your bodies will be separated into layers one atom\nthick, capable of being shelved or stored in such a way as to endure\nalmost infinite accelerations. Single cells will cover acres of space.\nBut do not be alarmed. The process will be painless and each particle\nwill be catalogued for future assembly. Your consciousness will endure\nthroughout the process.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rosalind looked at her gold-shod toes. She was wondering,\n  <i>\n   will they go\nfirst, or my head? Or will I be peeled like an apple?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked at Ivan and knew he was thinking the same thing.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Up in the committee room, the other Wolvers slumped around the table.\nOnly little Dotty sat straight and staring, speechless and unanswering,\nquite beyond their reach, like a telephone off the hook and with the\nconnection open, but no voice from the other end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had just switched off the TV after listening to a confused\nmedley of denials, prayers, Kometevskyite chatterings, and a few\nastonishingly realistic comments on the possibility of survival.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These last pointed out that, on the side of the Earth opposite the\nPacific, the convulsions would come slowly when the entombed spaceship\nburst forth\u2014provided, as seemed the case, that it moved without jets\nor reaction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would be as if the Earth's vast core simply vanished. Gravity would\ndiminish abruptly to a fraction of its former value. The empty envelope\nof rock and water and air would slowly fall together, though at the\nsame time the air would begin to escape from the debris because there\nwould no longer be the mass required to hold it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, there might be definite chances of temporary and even\nprolonged survival for individuals in strong, hermetically sealed\nstructures, such as submarines and spaceships. The few spaceships on\nEarth were reported to have blasted off, or be preparing to leave, with\nas many passengers as could be carried.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But most persons, apparently, could not contemplate action of any sort.\nThey could only sit and think, like the Wolvers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A faint smile relaxed Celeste's face. She was thinking,\n  <i>\n   how beautiful!\nIt means the death of the Solar System, which is a horrifying\nsubjective concept. Objectively, though, it would be a more awesome\nsight than any human being has ever seen or ever could see. It's an\nabsurd and even brutal thing to wish\u2014but I wish I could see the whole\ncataclysm from beginning to end. It would make death seem very small, a\ntiny personal event.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dotty's face was losing its blank expression, becoming intent and\nalarmed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We are in contact with our pursuers,\" she said in the\nfamiliar-unfamiliar voice. \"Negotiations are now going on. There\nseems to be\u2014there\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  a change in them. Where they were harsh and\nvindictive before, they now are gentle and conciliatory.\" She paused,\nthe alarm on her childish features pinching into anxious uncertainty.\n\"Our pursuers have always been shrewd. The change in them may be false,\nintended merely to lull us into allowing them to come close enough to\ndestroy us. We must not fall into the trap by growing hopeful....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They leaned forward, clutching hands, watching the little face as\nthough it were a television screen. Celeste had the wild feeling that\nshe was listening to a communique from a war so unthinkably vast and\nviolent, between opponents so astronomically huge and nearly immortal,\nthat she felt like no more than a reasoning ameba ... and then realized\nwith an explosive urge to laugh that that was exactly the situation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" said Dotty. Her eyes began to glow. \"They\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  changed! During\nthe eons in which we lay sealed away and hidden from them, knowing\nnothing of them, they have rebelled against the tyranny of a communal\nmind to which no thoughts are private ... the tyranny that we ourselves\nfled to escape. They come not to destroy us, but to welcome us back to\na society that we and they can make truly great!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Frieda collapsed to a chair, trembling between laughter and hysterical\nweeping. Theodor looked as blank as Dotty had while waiting for words\nto speak. Edmund sprang to the picture window, Celeste toward the TV\nset.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Climbing shakily out of the chair, Frieda stumbled to the picture\nwindow and peered out beside Edmund. She saw lights bobbing along the\npaths with a wild excitement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the TV screen, Celeste watched two brightly lit ships spinning in\nthe sky\u2014whether human spaceships or Phobos and Deimos come to help\nEarth rejoice, she couldn't tell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dotty spoke again, the joy in her strange voice forcing them to turn.\n\"And you, dear children, creatures of our camouflage, we welcome\nyou\u2014whatever your future career on these planets or like ones\u2014into\nthe society of enlightened worlds! You need not feel small and alone\nand helpless ever again, for we shall always be with you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outer door opened. Ivan and Rosalind reeled in, drunkenly smiling,\narm in arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Like rockets,\" Rosalind blurted happily. \"We came through the\ndurasphere and solid rock ... shot up right to the surface.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They didn't have to take us along,\" Ivan added with a bleary grin.\n\"But you know that already, don't you? They're too good to let you live\nin fear, so they must have told you by now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, we know,\" said Theodor. \"They must be almost godlike in their\ngoodness. I feel ... calm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edmund nodded soberly. \"Calmer than I ever felt before. It's knowing, I\nsuppose, that\u2014well, we're not alone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dotty blinked and looked around and smiled at them all with a wholly\nlittle-girl smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, Mummy,\" she said, and it was impossible to tell whether she spoke\nto Frieda or Rosalind or Celeste, \"I've just had the funniest dream.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, darling,\" said Rosalind gently, \"it's we who had the dream.

Edna begged him to see the doctor living in that new house\ntwo miles past Dugan's farm, but he refused. He point-blank refused to\nadmit he was sick\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  way\u2014in the head!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, a man could grow forgetful. He had to admit there were\nmoments when he had all sorts of mixed-up memories and thoughts in his\nmind. And sometimes\u2014like right now, lying in bed beside Edna, watching\nthe first hint of light touch the windows\u2014he began sweating with fear.\nA horrible, gut-wrenching fear, all the more horrible because it was\nbased on nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The chicken-run came alive; the barn followed minutes later. There were\nchores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except\nthat now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only\na vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields\nremain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to\nwaste....\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing\nstronger each day from helping out after school.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh? What happened to who?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I said, what....\" But then it slipped away. Davie? No, that was part\nof a dream he'd had last week. He and Edna had no children.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it. Edna opened her\neyes as soon as his weight left the bed. \"Like hotcakes for breakfast?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eggs,\" he said. \"Bacon.\" And then, seeing her face change, he\nremembered. \"Course,\" he muttered. \"Can't have bacon. Rationed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was fully awake now. \"If you'd only go see Dr. Hamming, Harry. Just\nfor a checkup. Or let me call him so he could\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You stop that! You stop that right now, and for good! I don't want to\nhear no more about doctors. I get laid up, I'll call one. And it won't\nbe that Hamming who I ain't never seen in my life! It'll be Timkins,\nwho took care'n us and brought our son into the world and....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She began to cry, and he realized he'd said something crazy again. They\nhad no son, never had a son. And Timkins\u2014he'd died and they'd gone to\nhis funeral. Or so Edna said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He himself just couldn't remember it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went to the bed and sat down beside her. \"Sorry. That was just a\ndream I had. I'm still half asleep this morning. Couldn't fall off last\nnight, not till real late. Guess I'm a little nervous, what with all\nthe new regulations and not working regular. I never meant we had a\nson.\" He waited then, hoping she'd say they\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  had a son, and he'd\ndied or gone away. But of course she didn't.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He went to the bathroom and washed. By the time he came to the kitchen,\nEdna had hotcakes on a plate and coffee in a cup. He sat down and ate.\nPart way through the meal, he paused. \"Got an awful craving for meat,\"\nhe said. \"Goddam those rations! Man can't even butcher his own stock\nfor his own table!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're having meat for lunch,\" she said placatingly. \"Nice cut of\nmulti-pro.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Multi-pro,\" he scoffed. \"God knows what's in it. Like spam put through\na grinder a hundred times and then baked into slabs. Can't hardly taste\nany meat there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, we got no choice. Country's on emergency rations. The current\ncrisis, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The way she said it irritated him. Like it was Scripture; like no one\ncould question one word of it without being damned to Hell. He finished\nquickly and without speaking went on out to the barn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He milked and curried and fed and cleaned, and still was done inside\nof two hours. Then he walked slowly, head down, across the hay-strewn\nfloor. He stopped, put out his hand as if to find a pole or beam that\nwas too familiar to require raising his eyes, and almost fell as he\nleaned in that direction. Regaining his balance after a sideward\nstaggering shuffle, he looked around, startled. \"Why, this ain't the\nway I had my barn....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard his own voice, and stopped. He fought the flash of senseless\npanic. Of course this was the way he'd had his barn built, because it\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  his barn!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rubbed his hard hands together and said aloud, \"Get down to the\npatch. Them tomatoes need fertilizer for tang.\" He walked outside and\ntook a deep breath. Air was different, wasn't it? Sweet and pure and\nclean, like country air always was and always would be; but still,\ndifferent somehow. Maybe sharper. Or was sharp the word? Maybe....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went quickly across the yard, past the pig-pen\u2014he'd had twelve\npigs, hadn't he? Now he had four\u2014behind the house to where the\nhalf-acre truck farm lay greening in the sun. He got to work. Sometime\nlater, Edna called to him. \"Delivery last night, Harry. I took some.\nPick up rest?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" he shouted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She disappeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked slowly back to the house. As he came into the front yard,\nmoving toward the road and the supply bin, something occurred to him.\n  <i>\n   The car.\n  </i>\n  He hadn't seen the old Chevvy in ... how long? It'd be nice\nto take a ride to town, see a movie, maybe have a few beers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. It was against the travel regulations. He couldn't go further than\nWalt and Gloria Shanks' place. They couldn't go further than his. And\nthe gas rationing. Besides, he'd sold the car, hadn't he? Because it\nwas no use to him lying in the tractor shed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He whirled, staring out across the fields to his left. Why, the tractor\nshed had stood just fifty feet from the house!\n </p>\n <p>\n  No, he'd torn it down. The tractor was in town, being overhauled and\nall. He was leaving it there until he had use for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went on toward the road, his head beginning to throb. Why should\na man his age, hardly sick at all since he was a kid, suddenly start\nlosing hold this way? Edna was worried. The Shanks had noticed it too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was at the supply bin\u2014like an old-fashioned wood bin; a box with\na sloping flap lid. Deliveries of food and clothing and home medicines\nand other things were left here. You wrote down what you needed, and\nthey left it\u2014or whatever they allowed you\u2014with a bill. You paid the\nbill by leaving money in the bin, and the next week you found a receipt\nand your new stuff and your new bill. And almost always you found some\nmoney from the government, for not planting wheat or not planting corn.\nIt came out just about even.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He hauled out a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had\nordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit Medicine Shelf. He carried it\ninto the house, and noticed a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag. A\ntelevision program guide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edna hustled over excitedly. \"Anything good on this week, Harry?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked down the listings, and frowned. \"All old movies. Still only\none channel. Still only from nine to eleven at night.\" He gave it to\nher, turned away; then stopped and waited. He'd said the same thing\nlast week. And she had said the films were all new to her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said it now. \"Why Harry, I've never seen this movie with Clark\nGable. Nor the comedy with Red Skeleton. Nor the other five neither.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm gonna lie down,\" he said flatly. He turned and stepped forward,\nand found himself facing the stove. Not the door to the hall; the\nstove. \"But the door....\" he began. He cut himself short. He turned and\nsaw the door a few feet to the left, beside the table. He went there\nand out and up the stairs (they too had moved; they too weren't right)\nand into the bedroom and lay down. The bedroom was wrong. The bed was\nwrong. The windows were wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The world was wrong! Lord, the whole damned world was wrong!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Edna didn't wake him, so they had a late lunch. Then he went back to\nthe barn and let the four cows and four sheep and two horses into the\npastures. Then he checked to see that Edna had fed the chickens right.\nThey had only a dozen or so now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When had he sold the rest? And when had he sold his other livestock?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood in the yard, a tall, husky man with pale brown hair and a face\nthat had once been long, lean and strong and was now only long and\nlean. He blinked gray eyes and tried hard to remember, then turned and\nwent to the house. Edna was soaking dishes in the sink, according to\nregulations\u2014one sinkful of dishwater a day. And one tub of bath water\ntwice a week.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was looking at him. He realized his anger and confusion must be\nshowing. He managed a smile. \"You remember how much we got for our\nlivestock, Edna?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Same as everyone else,\" she said. \"Government agents paid flat rates.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered then, or thought he did. The headache was back. He went\nupstairs and slept again, but this time he had dreams, many of them,\nand all confused and all frightening. He was glad to get up. And he was\nglad to hear Walt and Gloria talking to Edna downstairs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He washed his face, combed his hair and went down. Walt and Gloria were\nsitting on the sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. Walt was saying he'd\ngotten the new TV picture tube he'd ordered. \"Found it in the supply\nbin this morning. Spent the whole day installing it according to the\nbook of directions.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry said hi and they all said hi and he sat down and they talked\nabout TV and gardens and livestock. Then Harry said, \"How's Penny?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fine,\" Gloria answered. \"I'm starting her on the kindergarten book\nnext week.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's five already?\" Harry asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Almost six,\" Walt said. \"Emergency Education Regulations state that\nthe child should be five years nine months old before embarking on\nkindergarten book.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And Frances?\" Harry asked. \"Your oldest? She must be starting\nhigh....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because\nhe couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing\nand rising. \"Let's eat. I'm starved.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They ate in the kitchen. They talked\u2014or rather Edna, Gloria and Walt\ndid. Harry nodded and said uh-huh and used his mouth for chewing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walt and Gloria went home at ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at the\ndoor and Harry walked away. He heard Gloria whispering something about\nDoctor Hamming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was sitting in the living room when Edna came in. She was crying.\n\"Harry, please see the doctor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got up. \"I'm going out. I might even sleep out!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why, Harry, why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He couldn't stand to see her crying. He went to her, kissed her wet\ncheek, spoke more softly. \"It'll do me good, like when I was a kid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you say so, Harry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left quickly. He went outside and across the yard to the road. He\nlooked up it and down it, to the north and to the south. It was a\nbright night with moon and stars, but he saw nothing, no one. The road\nwas empty. It was always empty, except when Walt and Gloria walked over\nfrom their place a mile or so south. But once it hadn't been empty.\nOnce there'd been cars, people....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had to do something. Just sitting and looking at the sky wouldn't\nhelp him. He had to go somewhere, see someone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went to the barn and looked for his saddle. There was no saddle. But\nhe'd had one hanging right behind the door. Or had he?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He threw a blanket over Plum, the big mare, and tied it with a piece of\nwash line. He used another piece for a bridle, since he couldn't find\nthat either, and didn't bother making a bit. He mounted, and Plum moved\nout of the barn and onto the road. He headed north, toward town.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he realized he couldn't go along the road this way. He'd be\nreported. Breaking travel regulations was a serious offense. He didn't\nknow what they did to you, but it wasn't anything easy like a fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He cut into an unfenced, unplanted field.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His headache was back, worse now than it had ever been. His entire\nhead throbbed, and he leaned forward and put his cheek against Plum's\nmane. The mare whinnied uneasily, but he kicked her sides and she moved\nforward. He lay there, just wanting to go somewhere, just wanting to\nleave his headache and confusion behind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't know how long it was, but Plum was moving cautiously now. He\nraised his head. They were approaching a fence. He noticed a gate off\nto the right, and pulled the rope so Plum went that way. They reached\nthe gate and he got down to open it, and saw the sign. \"Phineas Grotton\nFarm.\" He looked up at the sky, found the constellations, turned his\nhead, and nodded. He'd started north, and Plum had continued north.\nHe'd crossed land belonging both to himself and the Franklins. Now he\nwas leaving the Franklin farm. North of the Franklins were the Bessers.\nWho was this Phineas Grotton? Had he bought out Lon Besser? But\nanything like that would've gotten around.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Was he forgetting again?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Well, no matter. Mr. Grotton would have to excuse his trespass. He\nopened the gate, led Plum through it, closed the gate. He mounted and\nrode forward, still north, toward the small Pangborn place and after\nthe Pangborns the biggest farm in the county\u2014old Wallace Elverton's\nplace. The fields here, as everywhere in the county, lay fallow. Seemed\nas if the government had so much grain stored up they'd be able to get\nalong without crops for years more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked around. Somehow, the country bothered him. He wasn't sure\nwhy, but ... everything was wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His head weighed an agonized ton. He put it down again. Plum went\nsedately forward. After a while she stopped. Harry looked up. Another\nfence. And what a fence! About ten feet of heavy steel mesh, topped by\nthree feet of barbed-wire\u2014five separate strands. What in the world had\nSam Pangborn been thinking of to put up a monster like this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked around. The gate should be further west. He rode that way.\nHe found no gate. He turned back, heading east. No gate. Nothing but\nfence. And wasn't the fence gradually curving inward? He looked back.\nYes, there\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  a slight inward curve.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dismounted and tied Plum to the fence, then stepped back and figured\nthe best way to get to the other side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The best way, the only way, was to claw, clutch and clamber, as they\nused to say back when he was a kid.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  It took some doing. He tore his shirt on the barbed wire, but he got\nover and began walking, straight ahead, due north. The earth changed\nbeneath his feet. He stooped and touched it. Sand. Hard-packed sand.\nHe'd never seen the like of it in this county.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked on. A sound came to him; a rising-falling whisper. He\nlistened to it, and looked up every so often at the sky, to make sure\nhe was heading in the right direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the sand ended. His shoes plunked over flooring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Flooring!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knelt to make sure, and his hand felt wooden planks. He rose, and\nglanced up to see if he was still outdoors. Then he laughed. It was a\nsick laugh, so he stopped it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took another step. His shoes sounded against the wood. He walked.\nMore wood. Wood that went on, as the sand had. And the roaring sound\ngrowing louder. And the air changing, smelling like air never had\nbefore in Cultwait County.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to\na waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat.\nHe looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under\nthe night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the\nmoon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised\ndamp fingers to his mouth. Salt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly,\nuntil he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him,\nand shut his eyes and mind to everything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came\ndown on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to\nher, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they\nwere which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing\nhim again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was getting light. His head was splitting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in\ntown....\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Town!\n  </i>\n  He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east,\nto the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him\nright down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find\nout what was happening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until\nshe broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately\u2014a long time\nlately?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by\nflooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where\nthere could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where\nthat ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons.\nAnd after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of\nCrossville. And after that....\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here\nhe was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could\nit be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to\nforget things he'd known all his life?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was\nbeyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on\nthe road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard.\nThere'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his\nfamily and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks\nheard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his\nvoice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get\nyou!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He rode on. He came to another house, neat and white, with three\nchildren playing on a grassy lawn. They saw him and ran inside. A\nmoment later, adult voices yelled after him:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You theah! Stop!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Call the sheriff! He's headin' foah Piney Woods!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no place called Piney Woods in this county.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Was this how a man's mind went?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He came to another house, and another. He passed ten all told, and\npeople shouted at him for breaking regulations, and the last three or\nfour sounded like Easterners. And their houses looked like pictures of\nNew England he'd seen in magazines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rode on. He never did come to town. He came to a ten-foot fence with\na three-foot barbed-wire extension. He got off Plum and ripped his\nclothing climbing. He walked over hard-packed sand, and then wood,\nand came to a low metal railing. He looked out at the ocean, gleaming\nin bright sunlight, surging and seething endlessly. He felt the earth\nsway beneath him. He staggered, and dropped to his hands and knees, and\nshook his head like a fighter hit too many times. Then he got up and\nwent back to the fence and heard a sound. It was a familiar sound, yet\nstrange too. He shaded his eyes against the climbing sun. Then he saw\nit\u2014a car.\n  <i>\n   A car!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was one of those tiny foreign jobs that run on practically no gas at\nall. It stopped beside him and two men got out. Young men with lined,\ntired faces; they wore policemen's uniforms. \"You broke regulations,\nMr. Burr. You'll have to come with us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded. He wanted to. He wanted to be taken care of. He turned\ntoward Plum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other officer was walking around the horse. \"Rode her hard,\" he\nsaid, and he sounded real worried. \"Shouldn't have done that, Mr. Burr.\nWe have so very few now....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The officer holding Harry's arm said, \"Pete.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The officer examining Plum said, \"It won't make any difference in a\nwhile.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry looked at both of them, and felt sharp, personal fear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take the horse back to his farm,\" the officer holding Harry said. He\nopened the door of the little car and pushed Harry inside. He went\naround to the driver's side and got behind the wheel and drove away.\nHarry looked back. Pete was leading Plum after them; not riding him,\nwalking him. \"He sure must like horses,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Am I going to jail?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The doctor's place.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stopped in front of the new house two miles past Dugan's farm.\nExcept he'd never seen it before. Or had he? Everyone seemed to know\nabout it\u2014or was everyone only Edna and the Shanks?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got out of the car. The officer took his arm and led him up the\npath. Harry noticed that the new house was big.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they came inside, he knew it wasn't like any house he'd ever seen\nor heard of. There was this long central passageway, and dozens of\ndoors branched off it on both sides, and stairways went down from it in\nat least three places that he could see, and at the far end\u2014a good two\nhundred yards away\u2014a big ramp led upward. And it was all gray plaster\nwalls and dull black floors and cold white lighting, like a hospital,\nor a modern factory, or maybe a government building. Except that he\ndidn't see or hear people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He did hear\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  ; a low, rumbling noise. The further they came\nalong the hall, the louder the rumbling grew. It seemed to be deep down\nsomewhere.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They went through one of the doors on the right, into a windowless\nroom. A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there,\nputting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred\nyears old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected\none or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or\nsudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No violence, Dad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little\ntreatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain\nagain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with\nthe big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let\nthem lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his\nscalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he\nwould let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so\nas to know whether or not he was insane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened to my son Davie?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the\ninsides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the\nswitch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so\nmany millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone\nknew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps\nthe whole world is dead\u2014except for us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry stared at him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"I can't take the time to explain it all. I have too much to do. Just\nthree of us\u2014myself and my two sons. My wife lost her mind. I should\nhave helped her as I'm helping you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't understand,\" Harry said. \"I remember people, and things, and\nwhere are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I haven't the time,\" the doctor repeated, voice rising. \"I have to run\na world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, but\nhow large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. The\npeople calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving me\nmore money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyone\nelse, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable to\nreach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should have\nknown they would.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You survived,\" the doctor said. \"Your wife. A few hundred others in\nthe rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived because\nI lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting the\ncatastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living to\nsurvive.\" He laughed, high and thin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His son said, \"Please, Dad....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No! I want to talk to someone\n  <i>\n   sane\n  </i>\n  ! You and Petey and I\u2014we're all\ninsane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land,\nany land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surrounded\nby people who are sane only because I made sure they would know\nnothing.\" He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. \"Now do you understand?\nI went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Most\nwere farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway.\nBecause farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later.\nI put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section of\nthe country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gave\nyou back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because we\ndon't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with big\ncrops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all,\n  <i>\n   sanity\n  </i>\n  ! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peace\nand consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He choked and stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stan ran across the room to the switch. Harry watched him, and his\nbrain struggled with an impossible concept. He heard the engines and\nremembered the ocean on two sides; on four sides had he bothered to\ncheck south and east; on\n  <i>\n   all\n  </i>\n  sides if that fence continued to curve\ninward. Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And this wasn't Iowa.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The explosions had ripped the world, and he'd tried to get to town to\nsave Davie, and there'd been no town and there'd been no people and\nthere'd been only death and poison in the air and even those few people\nleft had begun to die, and then the truck with the huge trailer had\ncome, the gleaming trailer with the little man and his trembling wife\nand his two sons....\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Suddenly, he understood. And understanding brought not peace but the\ngreatest terror he'd ever known. He screamed, \"We're on....\" but the\nswitch was thrown and there was no more speech. For an hour. Then he\ngot out of the chair and said, \"Sure glad I took my wife's advice and\ncame to see you, Doctor Hamming. I feel better already, and after only\none.... What do you call these treatments?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry gave him a five-dollar bill. The doctor gave him two singles in\nchange. \"That's certainly reasonable enough,\" Harry said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The doctor nodded. \"There's a police officer in the hall. He'll drive\nyou home so there won't be any trouble with the travel regulations.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry said, \"Thanks. Think we'll ever see the end of travel regulations\nand rationing and all the rest of the emergency?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will, Mr. Burr.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry walked to the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're on an ark,\" the doctor said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry turned around, smiling. \"What?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A test, Mr. Burr. You passed it. Goodbye.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harry went home. He told Edna he felt just great! She said she'd been\nworried when an officer found Plum wandering on the road; she thought\nmaybe Harry had gone off somewhere and broken travel regulations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Me?\" he exclaimed, amazed. \"Break travel regulations?

He refuses to believe that anything is wrong, but he does admit that there are times where he lies in fear over nothing and mixes up his memories. The story then jumps to the present, where he begins to think about a blond boy named Davie. Edna is confused because they have no children. Edna brings up seeing a doctor again, he angrily responds that it will only be Timkins who brought their son into the world. Edna tells him they had no son, and Timkins died a while ago. The scene cuts to breakfast, where Harry complains about a lack of meat. Edna explains that there is only multi-pro because of the current crisis in the country. Harry begins to go walk outside, but he experiences more strange memories that don\u2019t add up. He picks up the delivery that Edna ordered. Edna asks if there is anything good on television this week because there is only one channel. After a late lunch, Harry goes to check on the animals again and wonders what happened to the rest of the livestock. Edna tells him that they got the same as everyone else, and he goes upstairs again. When he awakes again, Gloria and Walt have arrived. He asks about Penny and Frances. After they leave, He takes his mare Plum out for a ride, and they arrive at a barbed wire fence area up north. He gets over the wire and continues to walk north, until the earth changes to sand. Then, the sand becomes wooden flooring; there is also a loud roaring sound. When he reaches a waist-high metal railing, he runs back to Plum again. Harry has the idea to ride to town, even if the other neighbors tell him to stop and for somebody to call the police. Soon, two policemen come out to escort him to the doctor. Harry asks the doctor where his son is, and the doctor explains that he is dead like so many millions of others. The doctor tells him he has so many things to do, and he says there are a few remaining people who are still alive. Harry\u2019s brain struggles with the impossible concept, and he thinks about how this is not Iowa. Just as Harry realizes what they are on, the switch is thrown, and he finds himself feeling better from the diathermy treatment. Before Harry leaves, the doctor tests him one last time by telling him that they are on an ark. Harry is confused, which means that the treatment works. He goes home to Edna and is happier than ever.

He and his wife, Edna, live in a time of crisis and so there are many government regulations to follow. Some of these regulations include food rationing, being restricting to farming vegetables, only being able to travel to the neighbors house, etc. While going about his day, Harry often has visions of a young boy named Davie, someone he understands to be his and Edna's son. He is also constantly discombobulated by the placement of things in the house as well as events that supposedly did or did not happen. This confusion leads Edna to be very worried about him, and she insists for him to visit Dr. Hamming, which he refuses. \n\nOne night, their neighbors Walt and Gloria visit. Harry mistakenly asks about their older daughter - who doesn't exist - and spends the rest of the dinner quiet. After the neighbors leave, Edna is furthermore distraught which prompts Harry to leave the house in hopes of clearing his mind. Outside, he creates a makeshift saddle over his horse, Plum, and rides off into the unplanted fields. After travelling for a while, he and Plum approach a fenced off property labelled \"Phineas Grotton Farm\". Trespassing nonetheless, he rides Plum forwards before pausing; he felt as if everything around him was wrong, including his supposed friend Pangborn putting up a massive fence. \n\nGoing over the fence, he noticed a roaring sound growing louder and the smell of the air changing. As he walked, the ground underneath him changed from earth to sand to wood. He came over to a metal railing and found that it overlooked an endless crashing water and salty air - the ocean. After a while, he rode Plum back to his farm, only to note that he had arrived without even needing to go through town. On the way back, he was spotted breaking travel regulations and was pulled over by the police, who take him to the doctor's office. \n\nAt the doctor's office, his confusion is finally explained away. While being prepped for treatment, Dr. Hamming reveals that his supposed son, Davie, and friend Pangborn, were indeed real and alive, but killed by the bombs. Only a few remain amongst the uninhabitable land, and so it was Dr. Hamming who brought them along to his inhabitable world. Dr. Hamming, his two sons, and his now late wife work together to wipe the bad memories from the townspeople and keep the community going as they, on board an ark, continually search for inhabitable land. As Harry begins to form his own conclusions, Dr. Hammings injects him with the treatment and his sane mind is restored. \n\nAt the end, Harry returns home to his wife.

His wife, Edna, often begs him to see the doctor in the town, but he refuses. He often remembers memories that are mismatched with reality. For example, he thinks he has a son, Davie, but all the people, including Edna, deny the fact. He remembers that his fields were planted fully with crops such as wheat and corn, not wasting the land, but now he can only plant a patch of vegetables with all the other fields remaining fallow. He thinks Timkins, the doctor he used to go for, is still alive, but Timkins died a long while ago, based on Edna\u2019s testimony. After eating the rationed food supplied by the government for breakfast, he checks his barn and farms around his house, which seem unfamiliar to him compared to his memory. He picks up the delivery of living supplies and sees the listed movies provided, having the same conversation with Edna as last week. The more he sees, the more he realizes that everything is wrong. When their neighbors visit them and eat with them, Harry has more mistakes in his memory and does not talk while eating. When Edna begs him to see the doctor again, he goes out to ride a mare called Plum.\n\nAt night, Harry rides Plum towards the north on the empty road. Soon after realizing he may be reported for breaking travel regulations, he cuts into an unplanted field. He faces a fenced farm where the owner\u2019s name is unfamiliar with what he remembered to be; he opens it and keeps going northwards. When he reaches the end, he sees a tall metal mesh with barbed wire fence with no gates and climbs to the other side of the fence, seeing nothing but the ocean while standing on the wooden floor. He goes back to the fence, climbs it, and mounts Plum. He tries to find the town but fails. He rides on the road, passing his and his neighbor's houses. People living next to the road shout at him for breaking the regulation, but Harry gives no care to those unfamiliar faces and goes to the southern tip, seeing the extension of the metal fence, climbing through it, and the ocean is there again. When he returns to the fence, two men in police uniforms from a car catch him. He gets in the car, letting one man lead his horse back to his house. They arrive at the doctor\u2019s house, where Harry is told by Doctor Hamming the truth that the people on the ark are the remaining humans in the world. All the other humans might have already died from the bombs, including his son Davie. Harry has those memory problems because his real memory is coming.

During breakfast, Harry complains about rations. Edna tells him they will have multi-pro meat for dinner - he is not satisfied. While doing the chores, Harry realizes his barn seems different and unfamiliar. After picking up the delivery, he says that the TV program guide has old moves, but Edna has never seen them. Harry decides to take a nap and feels that everything around him is wrong. After lunch, he goes back to the barn and sees that they have fewer chickens than he remembers. Their neighbors, Walt and Gloria, come over. Harry makes some strange comments about the neighbors' children - he keeps silent for the rest of the evening.

He sees waves beyond the railing - an ocean - and nervously runs back to Plum. He disregards the traveling regulations and rides along the road in the opposite direction - the citizens scream that he is breaking the law. Soon, he reaches the same high fence, railing, and ocean. A police car pulls over: one officer takes Plum, and the other drives Harry to Doctor Hamming. When entering the house, Harry hears some rumbling sound. The doctor, the officers' father, asks about the second son and starts working on Harry, who keeps asking about Davie. The doctor reveals that Harry\u2019s son, just like millions of others, died during a bombing. The doctor claims that he, together with his two sons, is now running the world for the few hundred who survived after putting them on his world with the only uncontaminated soil left. He has to control the crops and livestock. He says he erased all the knowledge about these events to help people remain sane. Harry realizes Davie is dead, and he isn\u2019t in Iowa. The doctor turns off the radio switch, and Harry immediately forgets this. He thanks Hamming for the treatment. Harry hears the doctor say that they are on an ark, but he doesn\u2019t understand what it means and goes home in peace. \n\n\n"}]}, {"question_text": "Who is Doctor Hamming, and what are his traits?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "a5b10cd324924559a7a364706d1618eb", "response_text": "Doctor Hamming is first described by Edna as someone who can treat Harry\u2019s so-called \u201cmental problems\u201d.

Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n  <i>\n   Anabasis\n  </i>\n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n  <i>\n   History of English Literature\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n  <i>\n   History\n  </i>\n  under observation for a while.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend\nturned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of\nher own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading\ntable, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine,\n  <i>\n   The Zeitgeist\n  </i>\n  , Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard route\nto the shelf where Taine's\n  <i>\n   History\n  </i>\n  reposed, take the volume down,\nsurreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages\nand return it to the shelf.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second\nmessage. It was as unintelligible as the first:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Habe\nwotnid ig ist ending ifedererer te. T'lide sid Fieu Dayol po jestig\ntoseo knwo, bijk weil en snoll doper entling\u2014Yoolna. asdf ;lkj asdf\n;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, perhaps not quite as unintelligible. He knew, at least, who Cai\nwas, and he knew\u2014from the reappearance of the words\n  <i>\n   wotnid\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n   Fieu\nDayol\n  </i>\n  and\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  \u2014that the two communications were in the\nsame code. And certainly it was reasonable to assume that the last\nword\u2014\n  <i>\n   Yoolna\n  </i>\n  \u2014was the name of the girl he had just seen, and that\nshe was a different person from the\n  <i>\n   Klio\n  </i>\n  whose name had appended the\nfirst message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book\nto the shelf and went back to the reading table and\n  <i>\n   The Zeitgeist\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kay didn't show up till almost closing time, and he was beginning\nto think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup till\ntomorrow when she finally walked in the door. She employed the same\ntactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by\nchance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same\nundetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"It's all right, it's only sugar,\" she said, laughing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm hopelessly clumsy,\" he continued smoothly, brushing the gleaming\ncrystals from her pleated skirt, noting the clean sweep of her thighs.\n\"I beseech you to forgive me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're forgiven,\" she said, and he noticed then that she spoke with a\nslight accent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you like, you can send it to the cleaners and have them send the\nbill to me.

I employ a variety of pseudonyms,\nof course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How interesting.\" She pronounced it \"anteresting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not famous profiles, you understand. Just profiles that strike my\nfancy.\" He paused. She had raised her cup to her lips and was taking a\ndainty sip. \"You have a rather striking profile yourself, Miss\u2014\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Smith. Kay Smith.\" She set the cup back on the counter and turned and\nfaced him. For a second her eyes seemed to expand till they preoccupied\nhis entire vision, till he could see nothing but their disturbingly\nclear\u2014and suddenly cold\u2014blueness. Panic touched him, then vanished\nwhen she said, \"Would you really consider word-painting\n  <i>\n   my\n  </i>\n  profile,\nMr. Quidley?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Would\n  </i>\n  he! \"When can I call?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hesitated for a moment. Then: \"I think it will be better if I call\non you. There are quite a number of people living in our\u2014our house.\nI'm afraid the quarters would be much too cramped for an artist like\nyourself to concentrate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quidley glowed. Usually it required two or three days, and sometimes a\nweek, to reach the apartment phase. \"Fine,\" he said. \"When can I expect\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stood up and he got to his feet beside her. She was even taller\nthan he had thought. In fact, if he hadn't been wearing Cuban heels,\nshe'd have been taller than he was. \"I'll be in town night after next,\"\nshe said. \"Will nine o'clock be convenient for you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perfectly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good-by for now then, Mr. Quidley.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was so elated that when he arrived at his apartment he actually\ndid try to write a profile. His own, of course. He sat down at his\ncustom-built chrome-trimmed desk, inserted a blank sheet of paper in\nhis custom-built typewriter and tried to arrange his thoughts. But as\nusual his mind raced ahead of the moment, and he saw the title,\n  <i>\n   Self\nProfile\n  </i>\n  , nestling noticeably on the contents page of one of the Better\nMagazines, and presently he saw the piece itself in all its splendid\narray of colorful rhetoric, sparkling imagery and scintillating wit,\noccupying a two-page spread.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was some time before he returned to reality, and when he did the\nfirst thing that met his eyes was the uncompromisingly blank sheet of\npaper. Hurriedly he typed out a letter to his father, requesting an\nadvance on his allowance, then, after a tall glass of vintage wine, he\nwent to bed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  In telling him that she would be in town two nights hence, Kay had\nunwittingly apprised him that there would be no exchange of messages\nuntil that time, so the next evening he skipped his vigil at the\nlibrary. The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n  <i>\n   The Zeitgeist\n  </i>\n  once again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli! Wotnid antwaterer Fieu Dayol hid jestig snoll\ndoper ifedererer te. Dep gogensplo snoll dopers ensing!\u2014Gorka. fdsa\njkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl;\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Judging from the repeated use of the words,\n  <i>\n   snoll dopers\n  </i>\n  were the\ntopic of the day. Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the\nbook back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what\na\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur\nsecret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged.\nIt virtually had to be an amateur secret society. Unless, of course,\nthey were foreigners. But what on earth foreign organization would be\nquixotic enough to employ Taine's\n  <i>\n   History of English Literature\n  </i>\n  as a\ncommunications medium when there was a telephone in every drugstore and\na mailbox on every corner?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow the words \"what on earth foreign organization\" got turned\naround in his mind and became \"what foreign organization on earth\" and\nbefore he could summon his common sense to succor him, he experienced\na rather bad moment. By the time the door chimes sounded he was his\nnormal self again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his\nshirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and\nlooked around the room to see if everything was in place. Everything\nwas\u2014the typewriter uncovered and centered on the chrome-trimmed desk,\nwith the sheaf of crinkly first-sheets beside it; the reference books\nstacked imposingly nearby;\n  <i>\n   Harper's\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n   The Atlantic\n  </i>\n  and\n  <i>\n   The Saturday\nReview\n  </i>\n  showing conspicuously in the magazine rack; the newly opened\nbottle of bourbon and the two snifter glasses on the sideboard; the\nsmall table set cozily for two\u2014\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The chimes sounded again. He opened the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She walked in with a demure, \"Hello.\" He took her wrap. When he saw\nwhat she was wearing he had to tilt his head back so that his eyes\nwouldn't fall out of their sockets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Skin, mostly, in the upper regions. White, glowing skin on which her\nlong hair lay like forest pools. As for her dress, it was as though\nshe had fallen forward into immaculate snow, half-burying her breasts\nbefore catching herself on her elbows, then turning into a sitting\nposition, the snow clinging to her skin in a glistening veneer;\narising finally to her feet, resplendently attired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went over to the sideboard, picked up the bottle of bourbon. She\nfollowed. He set the two snifter glasses side by side and tilted the\nbottle. \"Say when.\" \"When!\" \"I admire your dress\u2014never saw anything\nquite like it.\" \"Thank you. The material is something new. Feel it.\"\n\"It's\u2014it's almost like foam rubber. Cigarette?\" \"Thanks.... Is\nsomething wrong, Mr. Quidley?\" \"No, of course not. Why?\" \"Your hands\nare trembling.\" \"Oh. I'm\u2014I'm afraid it's the present company, Miss\nSmith.\" \"Call me Kay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They touched glasses: \"Your liquor is as exquisite as your living room,\nHerbert. I shall have to come here more often.\" \"I hope you will, Kay.\"\n\"Though such conduct, I'm told, is morally reprehensible on the planet\nEarth.\" \"Not in this particular circle. Your hair is lovely.\" \"Thank\nyou.... You haven't mentioned my perfume yet. Perhaps I'm standing too\nfar away.... There!\" \"It's\u2014it's as lovely as your hair, Kay.\" \"Um,\nkiss me again.\" \"I\u2014I never figured\u2014I mean, I engaged a caterer to\nserve us dinner at 9:30.\" \"Call him up. Make it 10:30.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The following evening found Quidley on tenter-hooks. The\n  <i>\n   snoll-doper\n  </i>\n  mystery had acquired a new tang. He could hardly wait till the next\nmessage transfer took place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He decided to spend the evening plotting the epic novel which he\nintended to write someday. He set to work immediately. He plotted\nmentally, of course\u2014notes were for the hacks and the other commercial\nnon-geniuses who infested the modern literary world. Closing his eyes,\nhe saw the whole vivid panorama of epic action and grand adventure\nflowing like a mighty and majestic river before his literary vision:\nthe authentic and awe-inspiring background; the hordes of colorful\ncharacters; the handsome virile hero, the compelling Helenesque\nheroine.... God, it was going to be great! The best thing he'd ever\ndone! See, already there was a crowd of book lovers in front of the\nbookstore, staring into the window where the new Herbert Quidley was\non display, trying to force its way into the jammed interior....\n  <i>\n   Cut\nto interior.\n  </i>\n  FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell me quickly, are there any\nmore copies of the new Herbert Quidley left? BOOK CLERK: A few. You\ndon't know how lucky you are to get here before the first printing ran\nout. FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Give me a dozen. I want to make sure that\nmy children and my children's children have a plentiful supply. BOOK\nCLERK: Sorry. Only one to a customer. Next? SECOND EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell\nme quickly, are ... there ... any ... more ... copies ... of\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Message no. 4, except for a slight variation in camouflage, ran true to\nform:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj Cai: Habe te snoll dopers ensing?\nWotnid ne Fieu Dayol ist ifederereret, hid jestig snoll doper.

What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle\nand staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay\ndoing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her\ncorrespondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl\nscouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges\nin communications!\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the\n  <i>\n   snoll-doper\n  </i>\n  enigma. The\nfact annoyed him, especially when he considered that a\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  ,\nfor all he knew, could be anything from a Chinese fortune cooky to an\nH-bomb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered Kay's odd accent. Was that the way a person would speak\nEnglish if her own language ran something like \"\n  <i>\n   ist ifedereret, hid\njestig snoll doper adwo\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered the way she had looked at him in the coffee bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered the material of her dress.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered how she had come to his room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't know you had a taste for Taine.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Her voice seemed to come from far away, but she was standing right\nbeside him, tall and bewitching; Helenesque as ever. Her blue eyes\nbecame great wells into which he found himself falling. With an effort,\nhe pulled himself back. \"You're early tonight,\" he said lamely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She appropriated the message, read it. \"Put the book back,\" she said\npresently. Then, when he complied: \"Come on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are we going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going to deliver a\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  to Jilka. After that I'm going to\ntake you home to meet my folks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The relieved sigh he heard was his own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They climbed into her convertible and she nosed it into the moving line\nof cars. \"How long have you been reading my mail?\" she asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Since the night before I met you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Was that the reason you spilled the sugar?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Part of the reason,\" he said. \"What's a\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She laughed. \"I don't think I'd better tell you just yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sighed again. \"But if Jilka wanted a\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  ,\" he said after a\nwhile, \"why in the world didn't she call you up and say so?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Regulations.\" She pulled over to the curb in front of a brick\napartment building. \"This is where Jilka lives. I'll explain when I get\nback.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He watched her get out, walk up the walk to the entrance and let\nherself in. He leaned his head back on the seat, lit a cigarette and\nexhaled a mixture of smoke and relief. On the way to meet her folks.\nSo it was just an ordinary secret society after all. And here he'd\nbeen thinking that she was the key figure in a Martian plot to blow up\nEarth\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her\n  <i>\n   folks\n  </i>\n  !\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly the full implication of the words got through to him, and he\nsat bolt-up-right on the seat. He was starting to climb out of the car\nwhen he saw Kay coming down the walk. Anyway, running away wouldn't\nsolve his problem. A complete disappearing act was in order, and a\ncomplete disappearing act would take time. Meanwhile he would play\nalong with her.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A station wagon came up behind them, slowed, and matched its speed\nwith theirs. \"Someone's following us,\" Quidley said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Probably Jilka.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later the station wagon turned down a side street and\ndisappeared. \"She's no longer with us,\" Quidley said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's got to pick someone up. She'll meet us later.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At your folks'?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At the ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The city was thinning out around them now, and a few stars were visible\nin the night sky. Quidley watched them thoughtfully for a while. Then:\n\"What ship?\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The one we're going to\n  <i>\n   Fieu Dayol\n  </i>\n  on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Fieu Dayol?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Persei 17 to you. I said I was going to take you home to meet my\nfolks, didn't I?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In other words, you're kidnapping me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She shook her head vehemently. \"I most certainly am not! Neither\naccording to interstellar law or your own. When you compromised me, you\nmade yourself liable in the eyes of both.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why pick on me? There must be plenty of men on\n  <i>\n   Fieu Dayol\n  </i>\n  . Why\ndon't you marry one of them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For two reasons: one, you're the particular man who compromised\nme. Two, there are\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  plenty of men on\n  <i>\n   Fieu Dayol\n  </i>\n  . Our race is\nidentical to yours in everything except population-balance between the\nsexes. At periodic intervals the women on\n  <i>\n   Fieu Dayol\n  </i>\n  so greatly\noutnumber the men that those of us who are temperamentally and\nemotionally unfitted to become spinsters have to look for\n  <i>\n   wotnids\n  </i>\n  \u2014or\nmates\u2014on other worlds. It's quite legal and quite respectable. As a\nmatter of fact, we even have schools specializing in alien cultures\nto expedite our activities. Our biggest problem is the Interstellar\nstatute forbidding us the use of local communications services and\nforbidding us to appear in public places. It was devised to facilitate\nthe prosecution of interstellar black marketeers, but we're subject to\nit, too, and have to contrive communications systems of our own.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why were all the messages addressed to you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They weren't messages.

It blended so flawlessly with its\nbackground that he wouldn't have been able to see it at all if he\nhadn't been informed of its existence. A gangplank sloped down from an\nopen lock and came to rest just within the fringe of the trees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lights danced in the darkness behind them as another car jounced down\nthe rutted road. \"Jilka,\" Kay said. \"I wonder if she got him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apparently she had. At least there was a man with her\u2014a rather\nwoebegone, wilted creature who didn't even look up as they passed.\nQuidley watched them ascend the gangplank, the man in the lead, and\ndisappear into the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Next,\" Kay said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quidley shook his head. \"You're not taking\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  to another planet!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She opened her purse and pulled out a small metallic object \"A\nlittle while ago you asked me what a\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  was,\" she said.\n\"Unfortunately interstellar law severely limits us in our choice of\nmarriageable males, and we can take only those who refuse to conform\nto the sexual mores of their own societies.\" She did something to the\nobject that caused it to extend itself into a long, tubular affair.\n\"\n  <i>\n   This\n  </i>\n  is a\n  <i>\n   snoll doper\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She prodded his ribs. \"March,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He marched.

He is fascinated by the first girl called Kay Smith who takes the first letter after he notices it. From then on, he has been guessing the meaning of snoll doper.

He is annoyed by this possibility after having sexual behaviors with Kay, which causes him to secretly read the fourth letter before Kay comes to pick it up. When Kay finds out that Quidley has been reading her letter, she tells him to come with her to deliver the snoll doper to Jilka, where Quidley is relieved because he realizes that snoll doper is the name of an object, not an identity. On their way to Jilka\u2019s place, Quidley keeps asking Kay what the meaning of snoll doper is, but Kay doesn\u2019t tell him.

A magic word, even today, isn't it? Lust and gold ... they go\nhand in hand. Like the horsemen of the Apocalypse. And, of course,\nthere's another word needed to make up the trilogy. You don't get\nany thing for nothing. So add this: Cost. Or you might call it pain,\nsorrow, agony. Call it what you like. It's what you pay for great\ntreasure....\n </p>\n <p>\n  These things were true when fabled Jason sailed the Argo beyond Colchis\nseeking the Fleece. They were true when men sailed the southern oceans\nin wooden ships. And the conquest of space hasn't changed us a bit.\nWe're still a greedy lot....\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm a queer one to be saying these things, but then, who has more\nright? Look at me. My hair is gray and my face ... my face is a mask.\nThe flesh hangs on my bones like a yellow cloth on a rickety frame. I\nam old, old. And I wait here on my hospital cot\u2014wait for the weight of\nyears I never lived to drag me under and let me forget the awful things\nmy eyes have seen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm poor, too, or else I wouldn't be here in this place of dying for\nold spacemen. I haven't a dime except for the pittance the Holcomb\nFoundation calls a spaceman's pension. Yet I had millions in my hands.\nTreasure beyond your wildest dreams! Cursed treasure....\n </p>\n <p>\n  You smile. You are thinking that I'm just an old man, beached\nearthside, spinning tall tales to impress the youngsters. Maybe,\nthinking about the kind of spacemen my generation produced, you have\nthe idea that if ever we'd so much as laid a hand on anything of value\nout in space we'd not let go until Hell froze over! Well, you're\nright about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of\ncivilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of\nthat. We did it for\n  <i>\n   us\n  </i>\n  ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we\nwere, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger\u2014and horror.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  If you doubt that\u2014and I can see you do\u2014just look at me. I suppose\nyou've never heard of the Martian Maid, and so you don't know the story\nof what happened to her crew or her skipper. I can give you this much\nof an answer.\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  was her skipper. And her crew? They ride high in the\nsky ... dust by this time. And all because they were men, and men are\ngreedy and hasty and full of an unreasoning, unthinking love for gold.\nThey ride a golden ship that they paid for with all the years of their\nlives. It's all theirs now. Bought and paid for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It wasn't too long ago that I lifted the Maid off Solis Lacus on\nthat last flight. Not many of you will remember her class of ship,\nso many advances have been made in the last few years. The Maid was\ntwo hundred feet from tip to tail, and as sleek a spacer as ever came\nout of the Foundation Yards. Chemical fueled, she was nothing at all\nlike the spherical hyperdrives we see today. She was armed, too. The\nFoundation still thought of space as a possible stamping ground for\nalien creatures though no evidence of any extra-terrestrial life had\never been found ... then.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My crew was a rough bunch, like all those early crews. I remember them\nso well. Lean, hungry men with hell in their eyes and a great lust for\nhigh pay and hard living. Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski.\nThere wasn't a man on board who wouldn't have traded his immortal soul\nfor a few solar dollars, and I don't claim that I was any different.\nThat's the kind of men that opened up the spaceways, too. Don't believe\nall this talk about the noble pioneering spirit of man. That's tripe.\nThere never has been such a thing as a noble pioneer. Not in space or\nanywhere else. It is the malcontent and the adventuring mercenary that\npushes the frontier outward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't know, that night as I stood in the valve of the Maid, watching\nthe loading cranes pull away, that I was starting out on my last\nflight. I don't think any of the others could have guessed, either.\nIt was the sort of night that you only see on Mars. The sort of night\nthat makes a spaceman wonder why in hell he wants to leave the relative\nsecurity of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle to go jetting across the belt\ninto deep space and the drab desolation of the outer System.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stood there, watching the lights of Canalopolis in the distance. For\njust a moment I was ... well, touched. It looked beautiful and unreal\nunder the racing moons. The lights of the gin mills and houses made a\nsparkling filigree pattern on the dark waters of the ancient canal, and\nthe moons cast their shifting shadows across the silted banks. I was\ntoo far away to see the space-fevered bums and smell the shanties, and\nfor a little while I felt the wonder of standing on the soil of a world\nthat man had made his own with his rapacity and his sheer guts and\ngimme.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought of our half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload we would\npick up on Callisto. And I counted the extra cash my packets of snow\nwould bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of\nthe outer Systems. There were plenty of cargoes carried on the Maid\nthat the Holcomb Foundation snoopers never heard about, you can be sure\nof that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In those days the asteroid belt was\n  <i>\n   the\n  </i>\n  primary danger and menace to\nastrogation. For a long while it held men back from deep space, but as\nfuels improved a few ships were sent out over the top. A few million\nmiles up out of the ecliptic plane brings you to a region of space\nthat's pretty thinly strewn with asteroids, and that's the way we used\nto make the flight between the outer systems and the EMV Triangle. It\ntook a long while for hyperdrives to be developed and of course atomics\nnever panned out because of the weight problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So that's the orbit the Maid took on that last trip of mine. High\nand clear into the supra-solar void. And out there in that primeval\nblackness is where we found the derelict.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I didn't realize it was a derelict when Spinelli first reported\nit from the forward scope position. I assumed it was a Foundation\nship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n </p>\n <p>\n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n  <i>\n   Space Regulations\n  </i>\n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n  <i>\n   stars\n  </i>\n  , Captain?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was\nher size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained\nsuch gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand\nfeet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable\nalienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully\nin the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with\nsomething like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff\nwere somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some\nstrange and alien way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for\ninter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of\nmystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave\nher birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was\nunthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she\nwas drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung\nabout Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away\nagain into the inter-stellar deeps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps\nyesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip\nthat bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We\nwould never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond\nthe ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know\nwhat killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she\nwas mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ...\nbut of what?\n </p>\n <p>\n  We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would\nhave meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better\nequipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by\nmen. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank.\nLet the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and\nbrought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things\nfigured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed\nby the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared\na boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth\nmillions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and\ncrossed to her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their\nfaces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit\nher tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives.\nShe's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage\ncompartments that are still unbroken.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was\nnothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull\nalone was left.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples\nof her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this\nstuff....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The\ncarcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and\nZaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her\ndown under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check\nthose compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When\nit's done report to me in my quarters.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a\nmetallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff\nis worth anything....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The metal was heavy\u2014too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship\nconstruction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that\ndistant world where this metal was made?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal\ntorn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver;\nthose strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were\nthere too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of\nthe metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand.\n  <i>\n   It had a\nyellowish tinge, and it was heavier\n  </i>\n  ....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held\nit grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm.\nSuddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It\nstruck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of\nmetallic lustre.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying\nall the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a\nbalance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It\nwas no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The\nwhorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing\nvibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had\ndrawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal\u2014the\nstuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was\nbuilt\u2014was now....\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Gold!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my\ntable-top.\n  <i>\n   Gold!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps,\nfrom some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ...\ndrawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability\nin its new environment. Stability as a terrene element\u2014wonderfully,\nmiraculously gold!\n </p>\n <p>\n  And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of\nthis metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have\nbeen a wild sound in those moments of discovery....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the\ndoorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black\neyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table.\nHe needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me\nthat his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was\nthe meaning of the expression on his heavy face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mister Spinelli!\" I snapped, \"In the future knock before entering my\nquarters!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. \"From the\nderelict, Captain?\" There was an imperceptible pause between the last\ntwo words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand on\nthe rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Speak your piece, Mister,\" I ordered sharply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prize\ncrew ... sir,\" he said slowly. \"I'd like to volunteer for that detail.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was a\nfirst class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk would\nneed good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned me\nto beware. I shook my head. \"You will stay on board the Maid with me,\nSpinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turning\nslowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat\nhim of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister\nSpinelli,\" I said deliberately, \"Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is\nthat clear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aye, sir,\" murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face\nand there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he\nturned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like\nhim to let it go at that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't\nfunctioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I\nrubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering\nabout Spinelli.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, and\nafter that there was tension in the air. Distrust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat\nto clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first\nplace I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the\nsecond place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and\nI was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that\nthere was no double-cross.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the\nrest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk.\nThat way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the\ntreasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they\nwere to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with\nthat starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. Finally\nI had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I had\nset the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Together, Spinelli and I watched the Maid's crew vanish into the maw\nof the alien ship and get her under way. There was a flicker of bluish\nfire from her jury-rigged tubes astern, and then she was vanishing in a\ngreat arc toward the bright gleam of Jupiter, far below us. The Maid\nfollowed under a steady one G of acceleration with most of her controls\non automatic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Boats of the Martian Maid's class, you may remember, carried a six\ninch supersonic projector abaft the astrogation turret. These were\nnasty weapons for use against organic life only. They would reduce a\nman to jelly at fifty thousand yards. Let it be said to my credit that\nit wasn't I who thought of hooking the gun into the radar finder and\nkeeping it aimed dead at the derelict. That was Spinelli's insurance\nagainst Zaleski.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I discovered it I felt the rage mount in me. He was willing to\nblast every one of his shipmates into pulp should the hulk vary from\nthe orbit we'd laid out for her. He wasn't letting anything come\nbetween him and that mountain of gold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I began thinking about it. Suppose now, just suppose, that Zaleski\ntold the rest of the crew about the gold. It wouldn't be too hard\nfor the derelict to break away from the Maid, and there were plenty\nof places in the EMV Triangle where a renegade crew with a thousand\ntons of gold would be welcomed with open arms and no questions asked.\nSuspicion began to eat at me. Could Zaleski and Cohn have dreamed up\na little switch to keep the treasure ship for themselves? It hadn't\nseemed likely before, but now\u2014\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gun-pointer remained as it was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the days passed and we reached turn-over with the hulk still well\nwithin visual range, I noticed a definite decrease in the number of\nmessages from Cohn. The Aldis Lamps no longer blinked back at the Maid\neight or ten times a day, and I began to really regret not having taken\nthe time to equip the starship with UHF radio communicators.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each night I slept with a hunk of yellow gold under my bunk, and\nridiculously I fondled the stuff and dreamed of all the things I would\nhave when the starship was cut up and sold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My weariness grew. It became almost chronic, and I soon wondered if\nI hadn't picked up a touch of space-radiation fever. The flesh of my\nhands seemed paler than it had been. My arms felt heavy. I determined\nto report myself to the Foundation medics on Callisto. There's no\ntelling what can happen to a man in space....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two days past turn-over the messages from the derelict came through\ngarbled. Spinelli cursed and said that he couldn't read their signal.\nTaking the Aldis from him I tried to raise them and failed. Two hours\nlater I was still failing and Spinelli's black eyes glittered with an\nanimal suspicion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're faking!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Like hell they are!\" I snapped irritably, \"Something's gone wrong....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Zaleski's gone wrong, that's what!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned to face him, fury snapping inside of me. \"Then you did disobey\nmy orders. You told him about the gold!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure I did,\" he sneered. \"Did you expect me to shut up and let you\nland the ship yourself and claim Captain's share?\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  found her, and\nshe's mine!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I fought to control my temper and said: \"Let's see what's going on in\nher before deciding who gets what, Mister Spinelli.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spinelli bit his thick lips and did not reply. His eyes were fixed on\nthe image of the starship on the viewplate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A light blinked erratically within the dark cut of its wounded side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get this down, Spinelli!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The habit of taking orders was still in him, and he muttered: \"Aye ...\nsir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The light was winking out a message, but feebly, as though the hand\nthat held the lamp were shaking and the mind conceiving the words were\nfailing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"CONTROL ... LOST ... CAN'T ... NO ... STRENGTH ... LEFT ... SHIP ...\nWALLS ... ALL ... ALL GOLD ... GOLD ... SOMETHING ... HAPPENING ...\nCAN'T ... UNDERSTAND ... WHA....\" The light stopped flashing, abruptly,\nin mid-word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What the hell?\" demanded Spinelli thickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Order them to heave to, Mister,\" I ordered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He clicked the Aldis at them. The only response was a wild swerve in\nthe star-ship's course. She left the orbit we had set for her as though\nthe hands that guided her had fallen away from the control.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spinelli dropped the Aldis and rushed to the control panel to make the\ncorrections in the Maid's course that were needed to keep the hulk in\nsight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those skunks! Double crossing rats!\" he breathed furiously. \"They\nwon't shake loose that easy!\" His hands started down for the firing\nconsole of the supersonic rifle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I caught the movement from the corner of my eye.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Spinelli!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  My shout hung in the still air of the control room as I knocked him\naway from the panel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get to your quarters!\" I cracked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't say a thing, but his big shoulders hunched angrily and\nhe moved across the deck toward me, his hands opening and closing\nspasmodically. His eyes were wild with rage and avarice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll hang for mutiny, Spinelli!\" I said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He spat out a foul name and leaped for me. I side-stepped his charge\nand brought my joined fists down hard on the back of his neck. He\nstumbled against the bulkhead and his eyes were glazed. He charged\nagain, roaring. I stepped aside and smashed him in the mouth with my\nright fist, then crossing with an open-handed left to the throat. He\nstaggered, spun and came for me again. I sank a hard left into his\nstomach and nailed him on the point of the jaw with a right from my\nshoe-tops. He straightened up and sprawled heavily to the deck, still\ntrying to get at me. I aimed a hard kick at his temple and let it go.\nMy metal shod boot caught him squarely and he rolled over on his face\nand lay still.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   I nailed him with a right from my shoe-tops.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Breathing heavily, I rolled him back face up. His eyes were open,\nglassy with an implacable hate. I knelt at his side and listened for\nhis breathing. There was none. I knew then that I had killed him. I\nfelt sick inside, and dizzy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wasn't myself as I turned away from Spinelli's body there on the\nsteel deck. Some of the greed died out of me, and my exertions had\nincreased my sense of fatigue to an almost numbing weariness. My arms\nached terribly and my hands felt as though they had been sucked dry of\ntheir substance. Like a man in a nightmare, I held them up before my\nface and looked at them. They were wrinkled and grey, with the veins\nstanding out a sickly purple. And I could see that my arms were taking\non that same aged look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was suddenly fully aware of my fear. Nothing fought against the\nflood of terror that welled through me. I was terrified of that yellow\ngold in my cabin, and of that ship of devil's metal out there in space\nthat held my shipmates. There was something unnatural about that\ncontra-terrene thing ... something obscene.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I located the hulk in the radar finder and swung the Maid after it,\npiling on acceleration until my vision flickered. We caught her, the\nMaid and I. But we couldn't stop her short of using the rifle on her,\nand I couldn't bring myself to add to my depravity by killing the rest\nof my men. It would have been better if I had!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I laid the Maid alongside the thousand foot hull of the derelict and\nset the controls on automatic. It was dangerous, but I was beyond\ncaring. Then I was struggling to get myself into a pressure suit with\nmy wrinkled, failing hands.... Then I was outside, headed for that dark\nhole.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sank down into the stillness of her interior, my helmet light casting\nlong, fey shadows across the littered decks. Decks that had a yellowish\ncast ... decks that no longer danced with tiny questing force-whorls....\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I approached the airlock of the compartment set aside as living\nquarters for the prize crew, the saffron of the walls deepened. Crazy\nlittle thoughts began spinning around in my brain. Words out of the\ndistant past loomed up with a new and suddenly terrifying\nperspective ... alchemy ... transmutation ... energy. I'm a spaceman,\nnot a scientist. But in those moments I think I was discovering what\nhad happened to my crew and why the walls were turning into yellow\nmetal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lock was closed, but I swung it open and let the pressure in the\nchamber rise. I couldn't wait for it to reach fourteen pounds ...\nat eleven, I swung the inner door and stumbled eagerly through. The\nbrilliant light, reflected from gleaming walls blinded me for a moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then I saw them! They huddled, almost naked in a corner, skeletal\nthings with skull-like faces that leered at me with the vacuous\nobscenity of old age. Even their voices were raw and cracked with the\nrusty decay of years. They babbled stupidly, caressing the walls with\nclaw-like hands. They were old, old!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I understood then. I knew what my wrinkled aged hands meant. That\ndevil-metal from beyond the stars had drawn the energy it needed\nfrom ...\n  <i>\n   us\n  </i>\n  !\n </p>\n <p>\n  My laughter was a crazy shriek inside my helmet. I looked wildly at the\ngleaming walls that had sucked the youth and strength from these men.\nThe walls were stable, at rest. They were purest gold ... gold ... gold!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ran from that place still screaming with the horror of it. My hands\nburned like fire! Age was in them, creeping like molten lead through my\nveins, ghastly and sure....\n </p>\n <p>\n  I reached the Maid and threw every scrap of that alien metal into space\nas I streaked madly away from that golden terror in the sky and its\nload of ancient evil....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname.

After a first exploration, Midas ends up with a mystery metal collected from the starship. In his further investigation, he finds that this mystery metal transforms into a heavier metal with a yellow tinge - gold. At the same time, he finds that holding the metal evokes fatigue in him, particularly in his arms.

Fearful of the other shipmates knowing and hence collecting it for themselves, Midas threatens Spinelli\u2019s silence. \n\nMidas continues the acquisition of this derelict ship by sending a crew, led by Cohn, to further investigate and take control of the ship. With Midas and Spinelli left behind, they watch their shipmates enter the alien ship.

He lives in a time when humans have explored and deemed safe the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle. At the beginning, he talks about greedy human nature and what it can cause. Years ago, he was a skipper of the Martian Maid spaceship flying to Callisto. His crew - Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski - people with love for money, not noble pioneers. They detected a derelict in the supra-solar void between the EMV Triangle and the outer systems. First, they thought it was The Holcomb Foundation ship, but this one was the largest craft they had ever seen. It was on a near-collision course and probably came in from the direction of Coma Berenices - the stars. He gathered the crew and informed them that they were entitled to claim this derelict as salvage. Everyone got excited and started thinking about the money they could get for this craft. The skipper was supposed to report their finding to the EMV base. But Midas decided to do that after receiving the money for its parts. When they got near the craft, Midas noticed that the metal of its flanks was grained with glittering whorls. They realized it was a starship, and it probably had been roaming through space for millennia. It was gashed deeply by something. Cohn and three other men came back disappointed, saying there was nothing valuable inside. He brought two samples of the ship\u2019s metal. Midas examined the chunks at his work-table, and soon the metal grew yellower. He spent some time testing the sample, and it became stable, drawing the necessary energy from somewhere, and turned into gold. Spinelli unexpectedly came into his office and noticed the piece of gold. He volunteers to go onboard the derelict, but Midas refuses. He also orders Spinelli not to say anything about the precious stone. Captain then saw Spinelli murmuring something to Zaleski and also felt inexplicably tired. He assigned  Marvin and Chelly to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk in case of mutiny. With time, the number of messages from Cohn started decreasing, and they came through garbled. They sent a strange message that stated that they had lost control. Spinelli got infuriated and almost fired at the big ship from the supersonic rifle. Midas aggressively ordered him to stop, and Spinelli attacked him. After a short fight, Midas killed the officer and immediately noticed that his hands were sickly purple. He put on a pressure suit and decided to go onboard the derelict. Inside he saw his crewmates, their skeletal bodies, and old faces. The walls around them were gold. Midas realized that the ship\u2019s metal was taking the energy required to make it stable from people who touched it. He ran and threw all the gold away. Midas landed on Callisto and was relieved of his command. The illness slowly spread from his hands to other body parts.

He starts a story about his experience of once having a tremendous amount of treasure. The story begins with him and the crew members on the spaceship Martian Maid when they find a massive derelict in the outer system of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle in space. Mister Spinelli is the first one to find the derelict. After he reports to the captain, and the captain measures the course of the derelict, they decide to search over the hulk based on the Space Regulation that any derelict belongs to the discoverer. They sense the chance of treasure in the derelict, searching over it without reporting to the nearest EMV base. At first, they do not find anything valuable inside the ship, so they decide to bring the whole derelict. Mister Cohn brings two pieces of the metal constituting the derelict to the captain.  When the captain examines the metal, he finds his hand grows bony and old while the metal becomes gold. He realizes that the metal can somehow transmute the energy to the property of metal, stabilizing itself to become gold. Mister Spinelli witnesses this discovery when the captain is trying in his room. When Mister Spinelli asks the captain whether he can help take the derelict abroad, the captain denies his request and orders him not to leak the information about the metal. Mister Spinelli tells Zaleski, who will take care of the derelict, about the metal. The captain orders the rest of the members to help Zaleski, ensuring that he cannot take the derelict himself. The captain sets the radar finder to watch the derelict. While Spinelli and the captain watch over the derelict with a turret pointing toward it, the message from Mister Cohn, who takes charge of the crew on the derelict, starts to decrease. When they find the derelict begins to get out of sight, Spinelli suspects them of betraying and attacks the captain, while the captain senses the danger of the decreasing message and fights back. The captain kills Mister Spinelli. As the captain examines his hand\u2019s condition, he realizes something goes wrong. The captain controls the Maid to catch up with the derelict, attempting to shoot it but fails. He wears the pressure suit and goes to the derelict, finding the prize crew aged and caress the metal. He realizes that the energy the metal draws comes from organic life, which in this situation is humans. He runs to the Maid, throws away any alien metals, and flees.

He begins to mention how old he is, and he is also poor because he would not be here otherwise. The man goes further on to describe how people of his generation did not let anything go because they were entitled to keep whatever they found. He begins talking about how he is the skipper of the Martian Maid, and the rest of the crew ride a golden ship that they paid for with their lives. He begins to talk about the experience not too long ago, how none of the crew would have known that this was their last flight. He thinks about the sweet payload they would pick up in Callisto from delivering all of the cargo. The captain also mentions how dangerous the asteroid belt was for astrogation at the time. The story then cuts to Spinelli reporting a derelict to the rest of the crew. Once they are near the collision, an abandoned spacer is found. However, even though they have claim over the ship, the captain\u2019s calculations show that it came from beyond the stars. Everybody becomes excited at the prospect of money; the derelict is much bigger than anything the Foundation Yards have ever built. It is also damaged too, as there is a gash from the stem to the stern with a jagged rip in its bare mangled innards. Some of the men are sent to go explore the ship, but they come back disappointed that there is nothing worthy left inside. The ship itself was never built to carry humans, but the crew still decides to take her along. When the captain puts the metal through the metallurgical testing kit, however, he discovers that it is gold. Spinelli tells him that the derelict is ready, but the captain makes him stay on the Maid with him. A few other members of the crew seem to be planning something, and the captain wonders if there is a chance that they will take off with the treasure ship. Spinelli reveals later that he did tell Zaleski about the gold, but they receive a message about losing control on the ship. Spinelli leaps at the captain, and the two of them fight. When the captain realizes that Spinelli is dead, he suddenly looks at his arms and sees how old he has become. He goes to the gold ship and sees the rest of the crew as almost skeletal beings. Realizing that the gold draws energy from them, he discards all of it and speeds away in the Maid. He is relieved of his duty on Callisto, and the Foundation refuses him another ship.

It is also this greed that allows Spinelli to get away with initially aiming the gun at the derelict ship and their fellow shipmates on board in case those shipmates try to escape with the gold.  \n\nThere are brief moments where he is shown to be an honorable man. For one, he fights Spinelli over blasting their fellow shipmates, and ends up killing Spinelli instead by accident. At the end of the story, he becomes terrified of the derelict ship and its devil metal, and yet still chooses to go aboard it to seek out his shipmates. \n"}, {"worker_id": "113", "uid": "5efb8eff09144be3ad6f0b87a152e70a", "response_text": "Captain Midas is a spaceman, a skipper of the Martian Maid spaceship.

This can be shown when Mister Spinelli and the captain find it hard to read the message from the crewmembers on the derelict; he senses the danger while Mister Spinelli only thinks about his treasure.

He is also poor, which is why he was so driven to keep the treasure ship when he found it. Captain Midas, however, is a lot more level-headed than the rest of the crew. He is aware of the dangers of being gold-hungry, which is why he keeps this finding to himself. The captain is also observant, figuring out the ship had come from beyond the stars based on his charts.
