Aphrodite\n, butt of the Space\nNavy. She's got something terrific in her guts and only\nher ice-cold lady engineer can coax it out of her!\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Winter 1948.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBrevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of the\nTellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in the\nviscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with a\njaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\nStrike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\nThe scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship\nAphrodite\nloomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the\nfat spaceship.\n\"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\"\nSenior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014\"Cob\" to his friends\u2014nodded in\nagreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship\nwith the poison personality.\" Cob was the\nAphrodite's\nExecutive,\nand he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs\non the\nAphrodite\n. She generally sent them Earthside with nervous\nbreakdowns in half that time.\n\"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen\nthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I\nthought....\"\n\"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski.\nCob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n\"The same.\"\n\"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the\nGanymede\n. And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\nStrike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n\"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n\"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n\"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\nGanymede\nbecause I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n\"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n\"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the\nGanymede\n. Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\nCob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n\"Me again. The\nGanymede's\nwhole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\nCob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the\nGanymede\nbroke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n\"Canalopolis?\"\nWhitley nodded.\n\"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n\"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n\"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\nWhitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the\nAphrodite's\nnether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\nStrykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek\nGanymede\n. \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\nCob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\nStrike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\nCob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\nStrike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\nCob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\nAnd she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed\nAphrodite\nwas a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten\nyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation\nIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a\nsurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the\nplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its\nformative stage, and at the time of the\nAphrodite's\nlaunching the\nsurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.\nHer designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit\nfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed\nof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The\nArtemis\n, the\nAndromeda\n, and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The\nthree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid\nhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.\nAll three were miserable failures.\nThe eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit\ntoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,\nwrongly.\nThe\nArtemis\nexploded. The\nAndromeda\nvanished in the general\ndirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a\nruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.\nAnd the\nAphrodite's\nstarboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her\nstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under\n20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a\ntangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.\nThe\nAphrodite\nwas refitted for space. And because it was an integral\npart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became\na workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She\ncarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and\ntanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from\nVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.\nRegulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet\nrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see\nto it that she did....\nThe Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted\nsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.\nStrike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a\nthird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet\nFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship\nof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.\nCob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.\nRadar Officer. She's good, too.\"\nStrike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me\nuncomfortable.\"\nCob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our\nratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\"\n\"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named\nthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\"\nWhitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.\nStrike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge\nbulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle\nof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an\nacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit\nrheostat.\n\"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob.\nStrykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the\nGanymede's\nflying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\"\nThe thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,\nhugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike\nreached for the squawk-box control.\n\"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying\nbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will\nrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\"\nWhitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.\n\"Orders, Captain?\"\n\"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.\nThey're sending someone down from the\nAntigone\n, and I expect him by\n600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. See\nto it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will start\nloading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, he\npaused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E/O to be?\"\nStrike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant\nHendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.\"\nCob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"I. V.\nHendricks.\" He shook his head. \"Don't know him.\"\nThe other officers of the\nT.R.S. Aphrodite\nwere in conference with\nthe Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flying\nbridge. She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale\nblue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\nStrike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n\"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles\nof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,\nwe have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. But I'm\ncertain this old boiler can take it. I understand the old boy who\ndesigned her wasn't as incompetent as they say. But Space Regs are\nspecific about mail runs. This is important to you, Evans. Your\nastrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus or\nminus the shortest route. And there'll be no breaking orbit. Now be\ncertain that the refrigeration units are checked, Mister Wilkins,\nespecially in the hydroponic cells. Pure air is going to be important.\"\n\"That's about all there is to tell you. As soon as our rather\nleisurely E/O gets here, we can jet with Aunt Nelly's postcard.\" He\nnodded. \"That's the story. Lift ship in....\" He glanced at his wrist\nchronograph, \"... in an hour and five.\"\nThe officers filed out and Cob Whitley stuck his head into the room.\n\"Captain?\"\n\"Come in, Cob.\" Strike's dark brows knit at the sight of the uniformed\ngirl in the doorway.\nCob's face was sober, but hidden amusement was kindling behind his\neyes. \"Captain, may I present Lieutenant Hendricks? Lieutenant\nI-vy\nHendricks?\"\nStrike looked blankly at the girl.\n\"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley.\n\"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find\nto say.\nThe girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her\nvoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your\npermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I\nmay\nbe able to\nconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem\nto think ... a senile incompetent.\"\nStrike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ...\nMiss ... but why should you be so....\"\nThe girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan\nHendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\nA week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous\nAphrodite\nhad burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\nThe\nAphrodite\nrumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\nFor all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\nAnd finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\nAt 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\nAphrodite's\nrefrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102\u00b0F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\nStrike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the\nLachesis\nand the\nAtropos\n. The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath\nwas Celia Graham's notation that the\nAtropos\ncarried none other than\nSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.\nStrike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into\nHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.\nAnd she agreed.\nOld Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The\nthermometer stood at 135\u00b0 and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia\nGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's\nweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....\nAnd then it happened.\nCob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the\nscrambler. It was a distress signal from the\nLachesis\n. The\nAtropos\nhad burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.\nRadiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the\nAtropos\nskeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.\nThe\nLachesis\nhad a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly\ntrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering\npower of the\nLachesis'\nmighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's\ndeathgrip on the battleship.\nA fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,\nbut they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that\neven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled\nAtropos\naway from a fiery end.\nCob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the\nflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n\"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n\"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\nShe read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is\nit\n! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\nHe returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the\nLachesis\n, he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\nIvy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n\"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n\"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\nThere were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I\nknow\nwe can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained! I can take her in\nand save those ships!\" Her expression turned to one of disgust. \"Or are\nyou afraid?\"\n\"Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. But are you so\ncertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...\nit'll be the last. For all of us.\"\n\"We can do it,\" said Ivy Hendricks simply.\nStrike turned to Cob. \"What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter in\nhere?\"\nWhitley shrugged. \"If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.\"\nCelia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon.\nAnd me so young and pretty.\"\nStrike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\"\n\"Evans here,\" came the reply.\n\"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the\nAtropos\nand hold it. We'll home on\ntheir carrier wave. They're in trouble and we're going after them. Plot\nthe course.\"\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\nStrike turned to Cob. \"Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve the\nblack-gang in the tube rooms. It's going to get hotter than the hinges\nof hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" Cob saluted and was gone.\nStrike returned to the squawk-box. \"Radar!\"\n\"Graham here,\" replied Celia from her station.\n\"Get a radar fix on the\nLachesis\nand hold it. Send your dope up to\nEvans and tell him to send us a range estimate.\"\n\"Yes, Captain,\" the girl replied crisply.\n\"Gun deck!\"\n\"Gun deck here, sir,\" came a feminine voice.\n\"Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spool\nof cable. Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" The girl switched off.\n\"And now you, Miss Hendricks.\"\n\"Yes, Captain?\" Her voice was low.\n\"Take over Control ... and Ivy....\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Don't kill us off.\" He smiled down at her.\nShe nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. Smoothly\nshe turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....\nLashed together with a length of unbreakable beryllium steel cable,\nthe\nLachesis\nand the\nAtropos\nfell helplessly toward the sun. The\nfrantic flame that lashed out from the\nLachesis'\ntube was fading, her\nfission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms.\nStill she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she\nsave her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles\nof the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences\nthat spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for\nthe trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins,\nthe gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning\nto melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plants\non the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men were\ndying.\nSwiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In her\nflying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in\nthe darkened viewport.\nThe temperature stood at 140\u00b0 and the air was bitter with the smell\nof hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with\nperspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped\nfor breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her with\napprehension.\nCarefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube on\nthe gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the\nAtropos\n. It plunged\nstraight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up against\nthe hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly,\na robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure.\nLike cosmic replicas of the ancient South American \"bolas,\" the three\nspacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge\ntogether.\nThey were diving into the sun.\nThe heat in the\nAphrodite's\nbridge was unbearable. The thermometer\nshowed 145\u00b0 and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by\ncomparison.\nIvy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came\nout of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field\nof vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit\nrheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious,\nbut too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument\npanel.\n\"\nIvy!\n\" Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.\n\"I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... the\nshow ... after ... all.\"\nStrike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the\ncontrol panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on\nthe surge-circuit.\nSlowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep within\nold Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into the\ncircuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the\ntube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships in\nspace slowed. Stopped. With painful deliberation, they swung into line.\nMore power. The whine changed to a shriek. A banshee wail.\nCob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. \"Strike, Celia's\nfainted down here. We can't take much more of this heat.\"\n\"We're trying, Cob!\" shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. The\ngauges showed the accumulators full. \"\nNow!\n\" He spun the rheostat to\nthe stops, and black space burst over his brain....\nThe last thing he remembered was a voice. It sounded like Bayne's. And\nit was shouting. \"We're moving 'em! We're pulling away! We're....\" And\nthat was all.\nThe space-tug\nScylla\nfound them.\nThe three ships ...\nAtropos\n,\nLachesis\n, and old Aphrodisiac ...\nlashed together and drifting in space. Every man and woman aboard out\ncold from the acceleration, and\nAphrodite's\ntanks bone dry. But they\nwere a safe 80,000,000 miles from Sol....\nThe orchestra was subdued, the officer's club softly lighted. Cob\nleaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the\nSpatial Cross on Strike's chest. Then he inspected his own and nodded\nwith tipsy satisfaction. He stared out at the Martian night beyond the\nbroad windows and back again at Strike. His frown was puzzled.\n\"All right,\" said Strike, setting down his glass. \"What's on your mind,\nCob? Something's eating you.\"\nWhitley nodded very slowly. He took a long pull at his highball. \"I\nunderstand that you goofballed your chances of getting the\nGanymede\nback when Gorman spoke his piece to you....\"\n\"All I said to him....\"\n\"I know. I know what you said ... and it won't bear repeating. But\nyou're not fooling me. You've fallen for old Lover-Girl and you don't\nwant to leave her. Ver-ry commendable. Loyal! Stout fellah! But what\nabout Ivy?\"\n\"Ivy?\"\nCob looked away. \"I thought that you and she ... well, I thought that\nwhen we got back ... well....\"\nStrike shook his head. \"She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a\ndesigning job.\"\nCob waved an expressive arm in the air. \"But dammit, man, I thought....\"\n\"The answer is\nno\n. Ivy's a nice girl ... but....\" He paused and\nsighed. \"Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well....\"\nHe shrugged. \"Who wants a wife that ranks you?\"\n\"Never thought of that,\" mused Cob. For a long while he was silent;\nthen he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to\nthe pages marked \"Canalopolis, Mars.\"\nAnd he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut\nStrykalski III was doing the same.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "6", "uid": "0c27bef1b7b644ffba735fdb005f9529", "response_text": "Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Stryakalski III, AKA Strike, is charged with commanding a run-down and faulty vessel, the Aphrodite. Aphrodite was the brain-child of Harlan Hendricks, an engineer who ushered in new technology ten years back. All three of his creations failed spectacularly, resulting in death and a failed career. The Aphrodite was the only ship to survive, and she is now used for hauling mail back and forth between Venus and Mars.\nStrike and Cob, the Aphrodite\u2019s only executive to last more than six months, recount Strike\u2019s great failures and how he ended up here. He used to fly the Ganymede, but was removed after he left his position to rescue colonists who didn\u2019t need rescuing. Strike was no longer trustworthy in Admiral Gorman\u2019s eyes, so he banished him to the Aphrodite. \nThe circuit that caused the initial demise of Aphrodite was sealed off. After meeting some members of his crew, Strike orders a conference for all personnel and calls in an Engineering Officer, one I.V. Hendricks. \nAfter Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks arrives--not I.V.--Strike immediately insults her by degrading the ship\u2019s designer, Harlan Hendricks. As it turns out, Hendricks is his daughter, and she vows to prove him wrong and all those who doubted her father. \nDespite their initial conflict, Strike and Hendricks\u2019 relationship soon evolves from resentment to respect. During this time, Strike\u2019s confidence in the Aphrodite plummets as she suffers from mechanical issues. \nThe Aphrodite starts to heat up as they get closer to the sun. The refrigeration units could not handle the heat, causing discomfort among the crew. As they get closer, a radar contact reveals that two dreadnaughts, the Lachesis and the Atropos, are doing routine patrolling. Nothing to worry about, except the Atropos had Admiral Gorman on board, hated by Strike and Hendricks.\nStrike and Hendricks make a joke about Gorman falling into the sun. As the temperature steadily climbs, the crew members overheat and begin fighting, resulting in a black eye. A distress signal came through from the Lachesis: the Atropos, with Gorman on board, was tumbling into the sun. The Lachesis was attempting to rescue them with an unbreakable cord, but they too were being pulled in. \nHendricks had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat, the one her father designed, and claimed it could help them rescue the ships. After some tension, Strike agrees and they race down to the sun to pick up the drifting dreadnaughts. \nStrike puts Hendricks in charge, but soon the heat overtakes her, and she is unable to continue. Strike takes over, attaches the Aphrodite to the Lachesis with a cord, and turns on the surge-circuit. They blast themselves out of there, rescuing the two ships and Admiral Gorman at the same time. \nCob and Strike are awarded Spatial Cross awards, while Hendricks is promoted to an engineering position at the Bureau of Ships. The story ends with Cob and Strike flipping through the pages of an address book until they land on Canalopolis, Mars. \n"}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "04e79312dede4a0da5993101e55a796a", "response_text": "Strike joins the crew of the Aphrodite after he has made several poor decisions while he was the captain of another spaceship. He is essentially being punished by his boss, Gorman, and put somewhere where he can do little harm. His job is to deliver the mail from Venus to Mars, so it\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\nWhen he meets the Officer of the Deck, Celia Graham, he immediately becomes uncomfortable. He does not like to work with women in space, although it\u2019s a pretty common occurrence.

His reputation preceded him, as Cob had specific questions about some of these events. The Aphrodite was incredibly impressive when it was designed, but did not live up to its expectations.

Ivy is the daughter of the man who designed the ship, and she is cold to Strike at first, as he is to her. However, her expertise in engineering generally, the ship specifically, and other skills as well as piloting, meant that Strike warmed up to her as their mission went on. As the ship was flying towards Mars on their route, the crew picked up a distress signal from the Lachesis, which was trying to pull the Atropos away from the gravitational pull of the sun after it was damaged in an equipment malfunction. The Admiral who had put Strike in charge of the Aphrodite was on the Atropos, and Ivy dislikes him even more than Strike does, but they know they have to try to save the crews.

He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\nThe man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\nSyme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n\"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n\"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n\"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n\"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI\u2014\"\nThe boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then\u2014\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear\u2014but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\nSyme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\nIt was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself\u2014that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity\u2014that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\nUp ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\nThe tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\nThe boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\nIt was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\nSyme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\nIt fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened\u2014one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\nHardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\nGritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\nThe reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\nHe swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\nHe heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\nWordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n\"Are you all right?\"\nSyme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy\nhair, a sharp nose, and\u2014oddly conflicting\u2014pale, serious eyes and a\nhumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.\n\"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n\"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought\u2014you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n\"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\nThe man sighed. \"I need a drink.\nYou\nneed a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh\u2014your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n\"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\nThey got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\nAnd he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of\nculcha\n, he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was\u2014his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe\nculcha\n, of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth\u2014in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\nHe listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n\"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!\u2014pardon\u2014seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!\u2014help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n\"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof\nculcha\ninside him.\n\"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\nSyme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming\u2014something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\nHarold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big.\nKal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\nFor Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\nIn the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\nLater, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\nThus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\nAnd so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\nSyme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n\"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n\"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n\"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n\"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\nSyme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\ntheir\ncrazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n\"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n\"They\nmight\ndo anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\nThe hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\nSyme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\nTate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\nSyme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\nAs the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\nFinally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\nTate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n\"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n\"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\nNeither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\nThe car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What\u2014?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\nWhen the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\nSyme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n\"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\nSyme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\nThe natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece\u2014or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\nTheir faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\nThe natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns\u2014strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\nSyme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\nOne Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough.\n\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n\"What do you think they'll\u2014\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\nwhooshed\ninto the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\nThe Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\nThey bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully\u2014a tunnel, now\u2014getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\nThe tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n\"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\nKalis methra\n,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\nseltin guna getal.\n\"\n\"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\nSyme swore amazedly.\n\"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n\"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n\"But how\u2014?\"\n\"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\nHe darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\nTate looked interested. \"But why this\u2014this gigantic masquerade?\"\n\"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\nTate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you\u2014had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nTate thought again. \"But\u2014\"\n\"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n\"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\nThe Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\"\nIt was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n\"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n\"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish to\nknow.\"\nSyme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\nTate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why\u2014\" he\nbegan.\n\"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n\"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\nHe sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n\"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n\"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.\n\"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n\"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.\"\n\"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\nTate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\nThe Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\nSyme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\nIt was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\nHe put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\nHe clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\nThe next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\nSyme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\nAt last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\nHe was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\nOnly then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but\u2014I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life. I\u2014I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\"\nSyme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\nHe led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\nStill silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That\nwas that.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "3", "uid": "109a5f45515c40358c74e170e54c8c7c", "response_text": "Syme Rector is the most-wanted raider in the Triplanet Patrol system and wants access to the ancient Martian city of Kal-Jmar so that he can steal the priceless objects located there.

He manages to unhook himself, and just as he estimates he can hold on one minute longer, a man comes and pulls him up. The man is Harold Tate, and he invites Rector to have a drink with him. As they get drunk, Tate confides to Rector that he needs a guide to take him to Kal-Jmar; he has discovered a way to enter the dome surrounding the city. \n\nThe two men set out on their journey and follow a gully they reach.

He steals his equipment and steps through the rapidly closing doorway. \nNow in the great city of Kal-Jmar, he takes his time and explores.

Humans have tried to enter the dome using explosives, diamond drills, and even tunnels under the city, but nothing they have tried has penetrated the dome. When Mars was first being conquered, humans tried to get into the city, but their efforts resulted in bloody battles with the current Martians, so eventually, the Mars Protectorate forbade any Earthmen from going near Kal-Jmar.

At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\nAt a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\nThen the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of\nshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the\nping of hot metal contracting.\nCoughing, Retief disengaged himself from the shock-webbing. He beat\nout sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it\nopen. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed\nof shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet\nwhined past his ear.\nHe lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left.\nHe inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere\na song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life,\nbuzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush\nfive yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped.\nRetief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log.\nA stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving\ncautiously, a pistol in his hand.\nAs he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him.\nThey went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then\nstruggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist\u2014\n\"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\"\n\"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea\nof shooting at me?\"\n\"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a\nFlap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something\nmove. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin'\nhere? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack\ncountry over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert\nlay.\n\"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\"\n\"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\"\n\"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't\nexpect\u2014\"\n\"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be\njoining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\"\n\"Yes. I'm\u2014\"\n\"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad\nmistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\"\n\"I'm\u2014\"\n\"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand\nweapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief\nfollowed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter\ngot to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face.\n\"You move good for a city man. I thought you folks on Ivory just sat\nunder those domes and read dials. But I guess bein' Lemuel's cousin you\nwas raised different.\"\n\"As a matter of fact\u2014\"\n\"Have to get you some real clothes, though. Those city duds don't stand\nup on 'Dobe.\"\nRetief looked down at the charred, torn and sweat-soaked powder-blue\nblazer and slacks.\n\"This outfit seemed pretty rough-and-ready back home,\" he said. \"But I\nguess leather has its points.\"\n\"Let's get on back to camp. We'll just about make it by sundown.\nAnd, look. Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a\nFlap-jack.\"\n\"I won't, but\u2014\"\nPotter was on his way, loping off up a gentle slope. Retief pulled off\nthe sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and\nfollowed Potter.\nII\n\"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two\nrevolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand. We're in\nbad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't\nmade a smart move since. First, we thought they were a native form we\nhadn't run into before. Fact is, one of the boys shot one, thinkin' it\nwas fair game. I guess that was the start of it.\" He stirred the fire,\nadded a stick.\n\"And then a bunch of 'em hit Swazey's farm here,\" Potter said. \"Killed\ntwo of his cattle, and pulled back.\"\n\"I figure they thought the cows were people,\" said Swazey. \"They were\nout for revenge.\"\n\"How could anybody think a cow was folks?\" another man put in. \"They\ndon't look nothin' like\u2014\"\n\"Don't be so dumb, Bert,\" said Swazey. \"They'd never seen Terries\nbefore. They know better now.\"\nBert chuckled. \"Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we,\nPotter? Got four.\"\n\"They walked right up to my place a couple days after the first time,\"\nSwazey said. \"We were ready for 'em. Peppered 'em good. They cut and\nrun.\"\n\"Flopped, you mean. Ugliest lookin' critters you ever saw. Look just\nlike a old piece of dirty blanket humpin' around.\"\n\"It's been goin' on this way ever since. They raid and then we raid.\nBut lately they've been bringing some big stuff into it. They've got\nsome kind of pint-sized airships and automatic rifles. We've lost four\nmen now and a dozen more in the freezer, waiting for the med ship. We\ncan't afford it. The colony's got less than three hundred able-bodied\nmen.\"\n\"But we're hanging onto our farms,\" said Potter. \"All these oases are\nold sea-beds\u2014a mile deep, solid topsoil. And there's a couple of\nhundred others we haven't touched yet. The Flap-jacks won't get 'em\nwhile there's a man alive.\"\n\"The whole system needs the food we can raise,\" Bert said. \"These farms\nwe're trying to start won't be enough but they'll help.\"\n\"We been yellin' for help to the CDT, over on Ivory,\" said Potter. \"But\nyou know these Embassy stooges.\"\n\"We heard they were sending some kind of bureaucrat in here to tell\nus to get out and give the oases to the Flap-jacks,\" said Swazey. He\ntightened his mouth. \"We're waitin' for him....\"\n\"Meanwhile we got reinforcements comin' up, eh, boys?\" Bert winked at\nRetief. \"We put out the word back home. We all got relatives on Ivory\nand Verde.\"\n\"Shut up, you damn fool!\" a deep voice grated.\n\"Lemuel!\" Potter said. \"Nobody else could sneak up on us like that.\"\n\"If I'd a been a Flap-jack; I'd of et you alive,\" the newcomer said,\nmoving into the ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather.\nHe eyed Retief.\n\"Who's that?\"\n\"What do ya mean?\" Potter spoke in the silence. \"He's your cousin....\"\n\"He ain't no cousin of mine,\" Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief.\n\"Who you spyin' for, stranger?\" he rasped.\nRetief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain\u2014\"\nA short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n\"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n\"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n\"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n\"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\nLemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\nRetief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n\"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n\"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\nBert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire\u2014\nWith a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n\"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n\"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n\"What's the idea...?\"\n\"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\nFive minutes' stealthy progress brought him to a slight rise of ground.\nWith infinite caution he raised himself, risking a glance over an\nout-cropping of rock.\nThe stunted trees ended just ahead. Beyond, he could make out the dim\ncontour of rolling desert. Flap-jack country. He got to his feet,\nclambered over the stone\u2014still hot after a day of tropical heat\u2014and\nmoved forward twenty yards. Around him he saw nothing but drifted sand,\npalely visible in the starlight, and the occasional shadow of jutting\nshale slabs. Behind him the jungle was still.\nHe sat down on the ground to wait.\nIt was ten minutes before a movement caught his eye. Something had\nseparated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards\nof open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The\nshape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt\nthe butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be\nright this time....\nThere was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of\nsand as the Flap-jack charged.\nRetief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping\nFlap-jack\u2014a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all\nmuscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge\nrippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.\nIt scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's\nshoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his\nfeet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it\nwas, it seemed more like five hundred.\nThe Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a\nthumb slip into an orifice\u2014\nThe alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.\n\"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't\ngentlemanly, but it's effective....\"\nThe Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief\nrelaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the\nthumb dug in.\nThe alien went limp again, waiting.\n\"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\"\nTwenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\nA penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n\"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears\u2014or no ears at all\u2014but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\nThere was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\nRetief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\nA low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n\"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n\"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n\"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n\"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n\"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n\"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n\"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n\"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n\"Delighted.\"\nRed lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n\"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit\u2014\"\n\"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\nInside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\nIII\n\"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\nRetief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n\"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n\"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n\"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n\"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\nA small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n\"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n\"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n\"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n\"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n\"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n\"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n\"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n\"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\nA scratchy sound issued from the disk. \"Pardon my laughter,\" Hoshick\nsaid, \"but surely you jest?\"\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said Retief, \"we ourselves seldom use weapons.\"\n\"I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved the\nuse of a weapon by one of your units.\"\n\"My apologies,\" said Retief. \"The\u2014ah\u2014the skirmishform failed to\nrecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.\"\n\"Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons....\" Hoshick\nsignaled and the servant refilled tubes.\n\"There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned,\" Retief went on. \"I hope\nyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishforms\nthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certain\nspecific life-forms.\"\n\"Oh? Curious. What forms are those?\"\n\"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but\nlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such\nworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.\"\n\"Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to\npoint it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are\nmuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed\nscratchily. \"Imagine considering us as\u2014what was the word?\u2014varmints.\"\n\"Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against\na serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.\nTherefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions\nso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to\nthese contests altogether....\"\nHoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.\n\"What are you saying?\" he gasped. \"Are you proposing that Hoshick of\nthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?\"\n\"Sir!\" said Retief sternly. \"You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red\nTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the\nnewest sporting principles.\"\n\"New?\" cried Hoshick. \"My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm\nenthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.\"\n\"It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the\ntwo individuals settle the issue between them.\"\n\"I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance could\none attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\"\n\"I haven't made myself clear,\" said Retief. He took a sip of wine. \"We\ndon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.\"\n\"You don't mean...?\"\n\"That's right. You and me.\"\nOutside on the starlit sand Retief tossed aside the power pistol,\nfollowed it with the leather shirt Swazey had lent him. By the faint\nlight he could just make out the towering figure of the Flap-jack\nrearing up before him, his trappings gone. A silent rank of Flap-jack\nretainers were grouped behind him.\n\"I fear I must lay aside the translator now, Retief,\" said Hoshick.\nHe sighed and rippled his fringe tentacles. \"My spawn-fellows will\nnever credit this. Such a curious turn fashion has taken. How much\nmore pleasant it is to observe the action of the skirmishforms from a\ndistance.\"\n\"I suggest we use Tennessee rules,\" said Retief. \"They're very liberal.\nBiting, gouging, stomping, kneeing and of course choking, as well as\nthe usual punching, shoving and kicking.\"\n\"Hmmm. These gambits seem geared to forms employing rigid\nendo-skeletons; I fear I shall be at a disadvantage.\"\n\"Of course,\" Retief said, \"if you'd prefer a more plebeian type of\ncontest....\"\n\"By no means. But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to\neven it.\"\n\"Very well. Shall we begin?\"\nWith a rush Hoshick threw himself at Retief, who ducked, whirled, and\nleaped on the Flap-jack's back ... and felt himself flipped clear by\na mighty ripple of the alien's slab-like body. Retief rolled aside\nas Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right\nhay-maker to Hoshick's mid-section. The alien whipped his left fringe\naround in an arc that connected with Retief's jaw, sent him spinning\nonto his back ... and Hoshick's weight struck him.\nRetief twisted, tried to roll. The flat body of the alien blanketed\nhim. He worked an arm free, drumming blows on the leathery back.\nHoshick nestled closer.\nRetief's air was running out. He heaved up against the smothering\nweight. Nothing budged.\nIt was like burial under a dump-truck-load of concrete.\nHe remembered the rangerform he had captured. The sensitive orifice\nhad been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area....\nHe groped, felt tough hide set with horny granules. He would be missing\nskin tomorrow ... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice\nand probed.\nThe Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast, probed deeper, groping with\nthe other hand. If the alien were bilaterally symmetrical there would\nbe a set of ready made hand-holds....\nThere were.\nRetief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away. Retief held on,\nscrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on\ntop of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped\nin terror, then went limp.\nRetief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard.\nHoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved\ngingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted\nhim into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily,\nadjusted the volume.\n\"There is much to be said for the old system,\" he said. \"What a burden\none's sportsmanship places on one at times.\"\n\"Great sport, wasn't it?\" said Retief. \"Now, I know you'll be eager to\ncontinue. If you'll just wait while I run back and fetch some of our\ngougerforms\u2014\"\n\"May hide-ticks devour the gougerforms!\" Hoshick bellowed. \"You've\ngiven me such a sprong-ache as I'll remember each spawning-time for a\nyear.\"\n\"Speaking of hide-ticks,\" said Retief, \"we've developed a biterform\u2014\"\n\"Enough!\" Hoshick roared, so loudly that the translator bounced on his\nhide. \"Suddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had\nhoped....\" He broke off, drew a rasping breath. \"I had hoped, Retief,\"\nhe said, speaking sadly now, \"to find a new land here where I might\nplan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop\nof paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But\nmy spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms\nwithout end. I am shamed before you....\"\n\"To tell you the truth, I'm old-fashioned myself. I'd rather watch the\naction from a distance too.\"\n\"But surely your spawn-fellows would never condone such an attitude.\"\n\"My spawn-fellows aren't here. And besides, didn't I mention it? No\none who's really in the know would think of engaging in competition by\nmere combat if there were any other way. Now, you mentioned tilling the\nsand, raising lichens\u2014things like that\u2014\"\n\"That on which we dined but now,\" said Hoshick, \"and from which the\nwine is made.\"\n\"The big news in fashionable diplomacy today is farming competition.\nNow, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll\npromise to stick to the oases and vegetables.\"\nHoshick curled his back in attention. \"Retief, you're quite serious?\nYou would leave all the fair sand hills to us?\"\n\"The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.\"\nHoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. \"Once again you have outdone\nme, Retief,\" he cried. \"This time, in generosity.\"\n\"We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of\nrules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think\nsome of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.\"\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "8", "uid": "5763f1a9afc945e3979933028291e984", "response_text": " The story begins with Consul Passwyn giving an assignment in a sealed envelope to Vice-Consul Retief, who is a diplomat with the Embassy. His mission is to visit the planet of Adobe and broker a land treaty between the Terrestrial settlers and an invading species, the Jaq. Before Retief leaves, Passwyn stresses the importance of following his orders exactly as written and acknowledges that no one from the Embassy has visited Adobe before, nor do they know the characteristics of the Jaq. Retief gets a ride to Adobe on a mail carrier with the help of a veteran pilot. When the pilot discovers they are entering the planet in the midst of war, he decides to leave on a lifeboat and gives control of the skiff to Retief. Then, Retief crash lands the skiff in order to avoid being blown up by a fission missile that was tracking him on his course. He lands in the middle of an Adoban oasis and immediately encounters a Terrestrial man named Potter, who confuses him for the cousin of one of his associates, Lemuel. Potter tells Retief about his group's history with the Jaqs, whom he refers to as \"Flap-jacks\" due to their wide, flat, tentacled bodies. Along with a team of settlers including Swazey, Lemuel, and Bert, Potter has been spending his days protecting his farms against attacks by the Jaqs after they mistakenly killed one three months prior, having mistaken it for one of the native species. Potter and his team do not trust the Embassy, having heard they are sending a representative to tell them to ceded control of the oases to the Jaqs. When they discover Retief is not Lemuel's cousin, Lemuel confronts Retief, who swiftly establishes his authority by knocking him out cold. When the group senses a Jaq nearby, Retief insists on dealing with the issue by himself. He hunts down the Jaq, they wrestle, and he assumes control by pressing his thumb against the Jaq\u2019s eye hole. The captive Jaq leads Retief to the Jaq headquarters, where he is introduced to their leader, Hoshick. Retief discovers the affability of the species and particularly their penchant for proper sportsmanship. He uses this knowledge to his advantage, and convinces Hoshick that it would be more sportsmanlike to abandon the war efforts and solve their differences through a simple wrestling match. Once again, he wins the match by squeezing his thumb against Hoshick\u2019s eye hole, and he convinces Hoshick to agree to cede control of the entirety of the oases to the Terrestrials and his people would be gifted all of the planets\u2019 desert areas. Upon returning to the Embassy, Retief tells Consul Passwyn the good news and then burns the envelope Passwyn had given him at the beginning of the story."}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "214208d3ae8f44efb780457d42fd1103", "response_text": "Consul Passwyn sends Vice-Consul Retief to Adobe to negotiate a peace deal between the native Jaqs and the human settlers who have moved there. Retief travels to Adobe on the mail ship, but as they near the planet, the pilot points out that there is fighting going on that he can see from fifty miles out; he refuses to land there to deliver Retief but offers Retief the use of the skiff. \n\nAs Retief begins heading toward the planet, he is tracked by a fission weapon. He outmaneuvers the bomb and lands on the planet where he soon encounters one of the settlers. They fight until the man realizes Retief is a human, introduces himself as Potter, and takes Retief to his camp where other men are. The men explain the history of their conflict with the Flap-jacks, saying that one of their men saw one and shot it thinking it was some sort of native game. After that, the Flap-jacks showed up at a farm and killed two cows. Since then, the two sides have been attacking each other back and forth.\n\nLemuel arrives and asks Retief who he is spying for as he pulls a weapon on him. Retief tells him to put the weapon up and then punches Lemuel quickly when he doesn\u2019t. Suddenly, they hear a noise; Retief throws a bucket of water on their fire, and they all dive for cover. Retief then announces he will go out by himself. \n\nAway from the camp, Retief sits and waits until a Flap-jack attacks him.

Retief introduces himself as Retief of the Mountain of Red Tape. The two have dinner as Hoshick explains the Flap-jacks' history with the settlers. They think the settlers are sportsmen who enjoy skirmishes, so every time the setters attack them, the Flap-jacks attack back. The Flap-jacks plan to bring in more equipment and skirmishers to match the settlers. Hoshick says he personally prefers a more limited skirmish without nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. \n\nRetief suggests eliminating the weapons and explains that the settlers only use them when they think they are fighting against lower life forms. In further discussion, he learns that the Flap-jacks are worried that the settlers want to take over the deserts they need to grow the lichens they use for their food and wine. The Flap-jacks have no use for the oases.

The shooter turns out to be Potter, a human who mistook Retief for a Jaq (or, as the human settlers refer to them, a \u201cflap-jack\u201d). He now assumes that Retief is the cousin of someone called \u201cLemuel\u201d, and brings him back to the other humans without letting Retief clarify his real identity. \n\nThe other humans are glad to see him, thinking he\u2019s a reinforcement. They tell him that they\u2019ve been engaged in back-and-forth raids with the Flap-jacks, and also that they\u2019ve heard that a bureaucrat is coming to talk them out of the dispute. Lemuel enters and reveals that Retief is not his cousin. He asks Retief who he is spying for and threatens him, at which time Retief easily subdues him in 1-2 punches, much to the awe of the other humans.\n\nRetief senses something outside and insists on looking into it alone. He hides and waits for a Jaq to attack him, and he subdues it by gouging its eye. He asks to see its leader, and is brought to the Jaq headquarters to dine and meet with Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns. \n\nRetief and Hoshick eat and discuss how best to conduct next steps in the ongoing battle between the Jaq and the human settlers, of whom Hoshick seems to assume Retief is the leader. They discuss banning certain weapons, until Retief eventually gets Hoshick to agree to combat between the two of them. After discussing a few rules,  they commence to fight. Hoshick does well until Retief manages to gouge him until he goes limp. \n\nAfterward, Retief asks Hoshick if he would consider giving the human settlers the oases and vegetables on the planet if the humans would let the Jaq have all the desert areas. Hoshick likes the idea. \n\nRetief goes back to the human camp, gives them some wine and offers the same deal.

Retief turned.\n\"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any\ndirection.\"\nII\nRetief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope\nof towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among\nflamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of\nwhite beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we\ncouldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why\ndon't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can\nobserve.\"\n\"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to\nthink of sightseeing.\"\n\"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're\nquestioning Corps policy!\"\n\"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it\nmight be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm\nnot back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan\nclutched at his arm.\nThere was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy\nbranch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,\ngreen-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like\nsteps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set\namong bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed\nas the creature cocked its head, listening.\nMagnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed\ndirectly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of\na giant trunk.\n\"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps\ninto the brush.\nA second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,\ndarted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its\nnarrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,\nturned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the\nright. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\nRetief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and\nstopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of\nthem.\"\n\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless\ncountenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.\n\"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall\nand\nfaces like that!\"\nThe smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n\"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\nMagnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout. How many of you are there?\"\n\"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\nThe alien whistled shrilly.\n\"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous\nstraits at the moment. I\nmay\nfly into another rage, you know.\"\n\"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small\nwhistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped\nthe beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it\nhappens.\"\n\"You certainly\nlook\nlike Qornt.\"\n\"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are\nsturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,\nthey do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a\ncommon ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation\nfor the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to\ntheir\nlevel.\"\n\"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador\nat Smorbrod?\" Retief asked.\nThe beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n\"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n\"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n\"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n\"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\nAnother whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\nare\nrather a hobby of theirs.\"\nZubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\"What did he say?\"\n\"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n\"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n\"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n\"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n\"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n\"If at all possible.\"\nRetief got to his feet.\n\"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\nIII\n\"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n\"We can't.\"\nMagnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\nMagnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\nThe party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n\"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\"This is Tarroon?\"\n\"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\nThe party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\nAhead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n\"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\nThe corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\nLesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the\nfeasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along\u2014\"\n\"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word\nwith him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from\nthe other Centers as well.\"\n\"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of\nthing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually\nidentical, except for the personal touches each individual has given\nhis ship.\"\n\"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as\nthough these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set\nof toy sailboats!\"\nRetief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can\nsee that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll\nkindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer\nthe matter to committee.\"\n\"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss\nhaving a cosy chat.\"\nThere was a pause.\n\"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most\ncompelling argument....\"\nRetief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol\nin one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at\nMagnan's chest.\n\"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy\nof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp\nhave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's\nanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now\nstep along, please.\"\n\"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\"I doubt it.\"\n\"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief\nstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at\nthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,\nstaring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,\nfollowed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table\nfaded.\nQorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped\nforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his\nchair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,\nmoving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to\nbear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy\nhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned\nface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz\nsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\nZubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\nQorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n\"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\nno\n!\"\nZubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n\"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n\"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\nThere was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\nQorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n\"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\"You bet.\"\n\"I'm convinced.\"\nQorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n\"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\nMagnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n\"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\nA servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n\"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n\"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\nQorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\nlike\nto fight.\"\n\"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n\"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\nIV\n\"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\"\nZubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\nQorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\"But\u2014\"\n\"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n\"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\"Over my dead body!\"\n\"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\nMagnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\nRetief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n\"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\nAcross the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\nRetief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\nQorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\nQorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\nZubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\nZubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n\"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\"I\nmay\nlose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\nRetief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\nRetief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\nThe blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\"But we must select a leader!\"\n\"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n\"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine\nglass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like\nto fight.\"\n\"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as\nQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush\nthings?\"\n\"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of\ngovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one\namong us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow\nhim.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest\ncommunity singing\u2014\"\n\"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would\nhappen?\"\n\"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with\nthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\nThe Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize\ninto Verpp\u2014\"\n\"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become\nwarmongers like Qorn?\"\n\"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old\nsaying goes.\"\n\"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What\nabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to\nsit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing\noff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But\nwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you\nTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what\nyour strength was.\"\n\"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've\nhad diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\"Oh, by no means.

The Qornt are predisposed to warlike tendencies so that they tend to die off and complete their life cycle in order to make room for new Qornt that develop from the Verpp. If they did not do this overpopulation would become an issue when they need to hibernate underground for 200 years.

HINCKLEY\nIt was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\ncity of metal that glittered malignantly before the\ncautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Summer 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nMartin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\nHe saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\nHe frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\nWass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\nMartin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\nThe men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n\"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\nMartin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\nRodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\nWass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\nThree feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\nWass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\nMartin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\nRodney nodded.\nAfter a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\nMartin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.\"\n\"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n\"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\nThe three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\nRodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\nWass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\nRodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\nA nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n\"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n\"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\nRodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n\"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\nHe straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n\"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n\"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\nThe blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\nMartin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\nWass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\nAgain Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\nParallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\nRodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\nThe bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\nAnger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\nRodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n\"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\nRodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n\"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\nRodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\nWass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now,\nand glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a\nglass wall.\"\n\"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are\u2014\"\n\"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check\nhere.\"\nMartin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving,\ntoward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.\nThe glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.\n\"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must\nbe all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences\nof this. Then\u2014\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we\nseparated.\"\nWalking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic\nthrough the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused\nthis?\"\nHe shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of\nthe planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of\nit.\"\n\"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\nMartin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well,\nalien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\nWass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\nRodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for\nhundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\nWass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\nMartin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're\nboth wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\nRodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at\nMartin. \"The wind\u2014?\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood\nstraighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\nThey reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,\nand stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\nWass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n\"The shield?\"\nWass nodded. \"What else?\"\n\"I don't know\u2014\"\n\"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we\nmight\u2014\"\nMartin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to\ncover the city.\"\nWass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n\"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We\nmay have to....\"\n\"What?\" Rodney prompted.\nMartin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\nHe led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall\nbuildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and\nplain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately\nfollowing his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the\ncorridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and\nthe streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into\neither side of the corridor.\nIt was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\nMartin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted\ndownward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\nA call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It\nlooks like a switchboard.\"\nThe three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a\ngreat arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had\ncome to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining\nthrough the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick\nrope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal\nroof.\n\"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\nMartin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n\"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make\nassumptions ever since we got here.\"\n\"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\nRodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n\"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\nRodney turned. \"But\u2014\"\n\"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n\"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n\"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the\nswitch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\nHe directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n\"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n\"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n\"We've got to\u2014\"\n\"No!\" Then, more quietly\u2014\"We still have eleven hours to find a way\nout.\"\n\"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the\ntime it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow\nit, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\nAnd Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n\"You too, Wass?\"\n\"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\nMartin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always\nthinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\nRodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us\nthat much less time to find a way out. Martin\u2014\"\n\"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you\nstand!\"\nWass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all\nhave guns, Martin.\"\n\"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited.\nAfter a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,\n\"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\"\n\"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out\nof here, then!\"\nMartin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the\nmetal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a\nhalt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must\nbe at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\"\nRodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around\nthe city would take years.\"\nMartin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level\nleading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\"\nWass laughed rudely.\n\"Have you a better idea?\"\nWass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That\nleads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for\nthe dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\"\n\"You mean\ndig\nout?\" Martin asked.\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\n\"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no\nequipment.\"\n\"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\"\nMartin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.\nRodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in\nto themselves.\"\n\"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\"\n\"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added.\nMartin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.\nThe incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet\nperhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,\ngleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the\ndarkness before the men.\nAt length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.\nMartin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.\nMetal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down\non them.\nWass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in\na circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up\nthere?\"\n\"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with\nhis light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to\nyou?\"\nRodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\"\n\"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole\ncity.\"\n\"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my\nnightmares stay when they're not on shift.\"\nMartin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he\nthought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him\nsilently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more\nso by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the\nthree lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,\npast something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another\nsomething which could have been anything at all.\nThe metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.\nThe edge of the city\u2014the city which was a dome of force above and a\nbowl of metal below.\nAfter a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\"\n\"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said.\nRodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was\nholding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\"\n\"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But\nRodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then\u2014\"I can't think of\nanything else.\"\nThey began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past\nthe same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all\nlooking different now in the new angles of illumination.\nMartin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,\nmatchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty\ntriumph in the rear.\nMartin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he\nsighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at\nsurface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and\nthen when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for\nnow. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.\nBut\u2014The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd\never explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and\nMartin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at\nsome point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a\nsort of racial insanity.\nNo, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.\nViewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,\na faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien\nmetal, which was making him theorize so wildly.\nThen Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\"\nLight from their torches was reflected, as from glass.\n\"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding\nup the procession?\"\nMartin was silent.\nWass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It\nwas in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before\na bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as\nthe combined light of their torches would reach.\n\"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.\nMartin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.\nWass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section\nof the bank.\nMartin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they\nwouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\"\nTorchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why\nnot?\"\nThey were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\"\n\"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by\nthe deadline we may be eating these.\"\nMartin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us\nfind a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no\nwater.\"\nRodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the\ngun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For\na plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.\nMaybe\u2014\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with\nsuper-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"\u2014only the\nlittle moisture in the atmosphere.\"\nThey stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side,\nRodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.\nRodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was\nloud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.\nMartin made a final effort. \"Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to\ntake off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.\"\nRodney jerked his head negatively. \"No. Now, I know you, Martin.\nPostpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without\nus and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate\nourselves and God only knows what else and\u2014\"\nHe reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.\nMartin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away\nsilently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.\nThe radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of\nRodney's sobs.\n\"Sorry,\" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. \"Wass?\"\nThe slight, blond man stood unmoving. \"I'm with you, Martin, but, as\na last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die\ngradually\u2014\"\nMartin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. \"I agree. As a last\nresort. We still have a little time.\"\nRodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight,\nnow that he was up again. \"Martin, I\u2014\"\nMartin turned his back. \"Skip it, Rodney,\" he said gently.\n\"Water,\" Wass said thoughtfully. \"There must be reservoirs under this\ncity somewhere.\"\nRodney said, \"How does water help us get out?\"\nMartin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not\nlooking back. \"It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can\nleave the same way.\"\nDown the ramp again.\n\"There's another ramp,\" Wass murmured.\nRodney looked down it. \"I wonder how many there are, all told.\"\nMartin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down,\npicking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the\npresent level. \"We'll find out,\" he said, \"how many there are.\"\nEleven levels later Rodney asked, \"How much time have we now?\"\n\"Seven hours,\" Wass said quietly, \"until take-off.\"\n\"One more level,\" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. \"I ...\nthink it's the last.\"\nThey walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of\nartificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.\nRodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about\nthe floor. \"Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are\ncemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled\u2014\"\n\"Rodney! Stop it!\"\nRodney swallowed audibly. \"This place scares me....\"\n\"The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.\"\n\"This is different,\" Wass said. \"Built-in traps\u2014\"\n\"They had a war,\" Martin said.\nWass agreed. \"And the survivors retired here. Why?\"\nMartin said, \"They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built\nbefore the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I\nknow?\"\nWass turned, too, persistent. \"But the planet was through with them.\"\n\"In a minute,\" Martin said, too irritably, \"we'll have a sentient\nplanet.\" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. \"Knock\nit off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.\"\nThey moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow\nshapes, looking carefully about them.\nRodney paused. \"We might not recognize one.\"\nMartin urged him on. \"You know what a man-hole cover looks like.\" He\nadded dryly, \"Use your imagination.\"\nThey reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again,\nuncertain.\nMartin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.\nWass said, \"All this had a purpose, once....\"\n\"We'll disperse and search carefully,\" Martin said.\n\"I wonder what the pattern was.\"\n\"... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later\nexpeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.\"\nTheir radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then\u2014\"Martin! Martin! I think\nI've found something!\"\nMartin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind\nhim.\n\"Here,\" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. \"Here. See?\nRight here.\"\nThree flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more\nfrom the floor.\n\"Well, they had hands.\" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of\nthe same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.\nFrom its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped\nand turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.\n\"Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?\"\nMartin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily\u2014almost too\neasily\u2014rotating the disk as it turned.\nSuddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed\nhinge.\nThe three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the\nsix-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that\ndrifted and eddied directly beneath them.\nRodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.\n\"Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!\"\nMartin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the\nopening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.\nHe was shaking.\nAfter a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember\nthe wind? Air currents are moving it.\"\nRodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.\nThen\u2014\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\"\nMartin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,\notherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\"\nRodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun\nloosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\"\nMartin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney\nand he, too, had drawn his gun.\nThe hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,\noutlined in the light of two torches.\nFor a little while he was alone.\nThen\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014a\ntenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about\nMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,\nobscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange\nobjects.\nMartin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering\nspirals.\nRodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said\nnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and\nnow, himself.\n\"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance.\n\"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered.\nRodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a\ntorch swinging wildly on the end of it.\nThe torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently\nrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.\nMartin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip\nof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the\nswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?\"\nWass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him\ndisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into\nthe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom\nof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He\nstamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing\njump. He sank no farther than his knees.\nHe sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest\nedge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long\nas we avoid the drifts.\"\nRodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.\n\"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and\nsank into the dust.\n\"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way,\nI'll go mine.\"\n\"Wass!\"\nThere was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.\nThe going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied\nand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were\nhard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.\n\"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked.\n\"Of course,\" Martin growled.\nThere was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.\nThe two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously\nplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times\nwithout number.\nThen Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours,\nMartin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\"\nMartin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his\nthroat.

Even on Mars, the only planet outside Earth\nin the solar system where the human anatomy was remotely suitable, a\nman could work more efficiently with redesigned lungs and temperature\ncontrols than he could inside a pressure suit. On more bizarre planets\na few light-years away the advantages of changeling bodies were\ngreater.\nUnfortunately for planetary development companies, hardly anyone\nwanted to become a changeling. High pay lured few. So a law was passed\npermitting a convicted criminal to earn his freedom by putting in one\nyear as a changeling for every five years he would otherwise have had\nto spend in rehabilitation.\n\"What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?\"\nAsa asked the man assigned to his case. It would look suspicious if he\nasked for Jordan's Planet without some preliminary questions.\n\"Four,\" answered the doctor.\n\"Squiffs for New Arcady. Adapted for climbing the skycraper trees and\nwith the arm structure modified into pseudo-wings or gliding. Then we\nneed spiderinos for Von Neumann Two. If you want the nearest thing we\nhave to Earth, there's Caesar's Moon, where we'd just have to double\nyour tolerance for carbon monoxide and make you a bigger and better\ngorilla than the natives. Last, of course, there's always a need for\nmuck men on Jordan's Planet.\"\nThe doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to\nchoose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the\nalternatives.\n\"What's the pay range?\" he asked.\n\"Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von\nNeumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.\"\nAsa raised his eyebrows.\n\"Why such a difference? Everyone knows about muck men living in the\nmud while they hunt Slider eggs. But don't your conversions make the\nchangeling comfortable in his new environment?\"\n\"Sure they do,\" said the doctor. \"We can make you think mud feels\nbetter than chinchilla fur and we can have you jumping like a\ngrasshopper despite the double gravity. But we can't make you like the\nsight of yourself. And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.\"\n\"Still,\" Asa mused aloud, \"it would mean a nice bankroll waiting at the\nend of the year.\"\nHe leaned forward to fill in the necessary form.\nSince it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special\nenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion\nchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa\nGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard\nto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.\nSometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once\none of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on\nspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he\ndecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all\nhe learned about space travel.\nNevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or\ncellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More\nimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and\nhad wanted to return.\n\"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The\nones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun\nto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to\ngo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine\nthousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that\nflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\"\nAsa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could\nunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while\nthe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic\nfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played\ntiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.\nElectrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but\nthe phenomenon remained a mystery.\nHardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to\nquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only\nrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of\nlight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.\nIt took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and\nfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had\never seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have\nmade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.\n\"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are\nthe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when\nyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes\nswooping out of nowhere at you.\"\n\"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the\nSliders?\"\nKershaw grinned.\n\"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping\nfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.\nWhen the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in\nthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back\nand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter\ncomes\u2014and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake\u2014you live to\ntell the tale.\"\nII\nAsa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to\nlearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another\nphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was\npounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the\ndoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.\n\"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests.\nAsa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning\nto lose consciousness.\n\"This is it!\" he thought in panic.\nHe felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before\nconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance\nto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the\nconversion tank right now.\nWhen he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for\na long time he was afraid to open his eyes.\n\"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\"\nIt was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his\neyes.\nEveryone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one\nstand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that\nhis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his\nlower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward\nso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around\nas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with\nbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like\nclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of\nhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.\nThis, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.\nIt would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong\ntraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly\nemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under\nthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could\nstill weep.\nHe started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.\n\"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only\ntry hopping this time. And take it easy.\"\nAsa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerve\nand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as high\nas Kershaw's head.\n\"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll\ngo outside.\"\nAsa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of\nfabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as\nKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room\nwhere they had been left to revive from conversion.\nThey went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from\nthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard\nwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky\nof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud\nflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged\nalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\nFrom fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them\nin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were\na gun and a long knife.\n\"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big\neverywhere in proportion.\n\"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\n\"I'm Graybar.\"\n\"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,\nyou.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\n\"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty\nand warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\nAsa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his\ndistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown\nhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim\nrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a\nnative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\nFurston laughed.\n\"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any\nideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is\nwhere you eat.\"\nAsa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He\nlifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from\nan observation tower on the roof.\nHe leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\nGazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session\nwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\nThe girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried\nhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent\nposition to make the riddance permanent.\nAt supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with\nthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the\ntwo were doing out here.\n\"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of\nthe others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\n\"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel\nhe is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the\noperations.\"\nIII\nNext morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to\ncarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and\nassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called\nGraybar aside.\n\"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week\nknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there\nand work that muck.\"\nFurston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could\nshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the\ncourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it\nand hopped along after Kershaw.\nFeet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the\nHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The\nmud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was\nnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins\nlike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded\nand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced\neye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\n\"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here\nlately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,\nstart shooting.\"\nAt each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no\nSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as\nmuch as on top of it.\nKershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten\nyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in\nthe muck.\n\"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg\nwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to\nspot when the new weeds start growing.\"\nKershaw took a long look around.\n\"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\nThey started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs\nof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually\na muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw\ndug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had\nto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit\nbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently\nbefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he\nworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything\nabout the operation was wrong.\n\"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping\nslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to\nwatch.\n\"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of\nmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look\nat it.\"\nA SLIDER EGG\nThe egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds\nbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's\nearphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the\nscintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider\nfor help. Asa looked around.\n\"Jump!\" he shouted.\nAt the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black\nscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the\nweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row\nupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered\nits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot\nforward.\nAsa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.\nWhile he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio\ndown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned\ninstantly, his gun in his hand.\n\"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw\nand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\n\"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\n\"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\n\"On the way.\"\nAsa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by\nthe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the\nother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where\nKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working\nmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another\ncharge.\nAiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The\nrocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray\nflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward\nAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw\nthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs\nwere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the\nSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he\nthrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired\nagain.\nEven as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered\nwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.\nDesperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body\nshiver and lie still.\nAsa took a deep breath and looked around.\n\"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\"\n\"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.\nAsa leaped over to him.\n\"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good\none. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\"\n\"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over\nat the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on\ngetting killed doing this?\"\n\"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six\neggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\nAsa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\nthe egg.\n\"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n\"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\nThe big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\nsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see\nTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open\nand leaned out.\n\"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n\"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\nget the egg.\"\nWhile Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\nwaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.\nKershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred\npounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.\nDorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's\nshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the\ncabin was crowded.\n\"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\n\"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\nAsa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\n\"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\n\"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to\nHarriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might\nask him to tell you about it.\"\nDorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that\nworried Asa.\n\"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In\nanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.\nA round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty\nminutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.\nAfter an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return\nfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg\napproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the\negg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\nAsa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\n\"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you\ncoming?\"\nThere was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\nIf he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him\nall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\nWhat was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\nA whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\nThen he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\nNo machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\nAsa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\nIV\n\"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n\"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\nShe looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n\"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\nAsa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n\"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\nShe shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n\"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n\"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\nAsa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n\"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n\"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n\"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "ae7b3f80b0e74b22abf9e6841729ba0b", "response_text": "Asa Graybar is a biological engineer who studies keeping Slider eggs alive and he is accused of a crime at the opening of the story.

Asa chooses to work one year as a muck man on Jordan\u2019s Planet where the Slider eggs are harvested.

His cellmate is Kershaw, a man who has worked as a muck man in the past.

His options for punishment are five years in a \"social reorientation\" program or one year working on a different planet after modifying his body to function in a different environment. Asa's cellmate seems to think this is the much more dangerous option, but it's the one Asa chooses. The technology of the time allows for regeneration of cells, extending people's lives and allowing them to modify their anatomy to fit a different environment. Asa wants to go to Jordan's Planet specifically, and there is always need for workers there because it is dangerous, so he is able to get a post there. Kershaw, another convict, is on the same trip--he has done this work before. The two men are most interested in the eggs of a creature called a Slider. The eggs have beautiful clear shells and seem to discharge lightning, in a way the humans do not yet understand--being muck men on Jordan's Planet means hunting for these eggs. The eggs die over the course of four years, and Asa wants to find a way to preserve them--this would be a hit to the Hazeltyne monopoly, which Asa believes is the source of his being framed. After arriving on Jordan's Planet, Asa and Kershaw head to the conversion tanks and their bodies are modified to suit the planet. The result is frog-like with pinkish scaly skin and a pair of wings. Asa learns he has to hop instead of walk, and Kershaw gives him pointers as they head to meet Furston, the man who would assign them their jobs. Hazeltyne's daughter (Harriet) and general manager (Tom Dorr), who had been present at Asa's trial, watched as Asa trained--it seems Asa's not the only one who dislikes Dorr. Asa is given supplies to go on a muck trip with Kershaw so that he does not go on his first trip solo. Once they find a safe location, they start to dig for eggs, and Kershaw finds one. As it flashes, the mother Slider starts to run towards the men who run for their lives and call the rescue helicopter. Kershaw manages to drop the egg, and the two men fight under attack by the Slider. Asa recovers the egg as the helicopter arrives with Tom Dorr and Harriet inside, and Asa is worried by Dorr's demeanor. There is only space for one of the men in the helicopter but Asa seems to have been abandoned as he waits for the return.

He believes he has been framed by Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne\u2019s general manager, who has brought the owner\u2019s daughter Harriet to the courtroom. Asa is given his choice of two sentences; rather than a relatively comfortable five years in a rehab clinic, Asa opts for a year as a changeling so that he can go to Jordan\u2019s Planet and study slider eggs. He believes his work with eggs prompted the Hazeltyne Company to frame him.\n\nAsa chooses to go to Jordan\u2019s Planet, where the eggs come from. On his way there, he meets Kershaw, a repeat muck man infatuated with the eggs.  Both men are turned into muck men: large, mutated creatures with some oddly unsettling human facial features. Humans have discovered how to prolong life and regenerate organs, which has also led to the changeling process, where convicts can be physiologically altered to be suited for life on other planets. \n\nAsa is trained to use his new body and reckon with the double gravity on the planet. The next day, Kershaw shows Asa the ropes until Kershaw finds an egg. His appreciation of it clouds his judgement, and Asa realizes just in time that Kershaw warned him that the sliders typically attack when the eggs are removed. A slider injures Kershaw\u2019s leg, and Asa jumps out of the way and calls for help before killing the slider in the nick of time. \n\nWhen a helicopter arrives, Tom Dorr and Harriet are in it. Asa insists that they should take the injured Kershaw and he should stay with the egg, since they both won\u2019t fit in the helicopter. Dorr demands that Asa give him the egg, but Asa refuses. The helicopter leaves Asa alone with the egg. \n\nAsa starts to get worried when the helicopter hasn\u2019t returned an hour later, and hopes the sliders don\u2019t attack at night. The helicopter comes back, but it lands clumsily and sticks in the mud. Harriet explains that she is a skilled pilot, but not in this gravity. She also details how she and Dorr argued because he wanted to leave Asa there and let the sliders (who do feed at night, on their own kind like the dead one near Asa) have at him. She told Dorr that she didn\u2019t like how he was running her father\u2019s business, and he told her to run it and stormed off. \n\nAs the passage ends, Asa and Harriet are in the midst of a dicey situation. He can\u2019t lift the helicopter up, and he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019d have a chance of fighting off the sliders in the rain - they\u2019ll have to try to make their way back. He asks Harriet where the rest of the muck men are, and she says they were all called back when the first helicopter came out, but that some may not be back yet. \n"}]}, {"question_text": "What settings does the story take place in?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "ae7b3f80b0e74b22abf9e6841729ba0b", "response_text": "The story opens on Earth and then travels to Jordan\u2019s planet.\nJordan\u2019s planet is the place where Asa goes as a changeling to be a muck man. \nThere is a base on Jordan's planet which has a laboratory for converting prisoners into muck men, living quarters and kitchen, and a courtyard with high walls to keep the Sliders out.

Now it looks like the\ngoats will get it.\"\n\"Will that scrubland support a crop?\" Retief said, eyeing the\nlichen-covered knolls.\n\"Sure. We start with legumes and follow up with cereals. Wait until you\nsee this next section. It's an old flood plain, came into production\nthirty years ago. One of our finest\u2014\"\nThe air-car topped a rise. The Chef dropped his cigar and half rose,\nwith a hoarse yell. A herd of scraggly goats tossed their heads among a\nstand of ripe grain. The car pulled to a stop. Retief held the Boyar's\narm.\n\"Keep calm, Georges,\" he said. \"Remember, we're on a diplomatic\nmission. It wouldn't do to come to the conference table smelling of\ngoats.\"\n\"Let me at 'em!\" Georges roared. \"I'll throttle 'em with my bare hands!\"\nA bearded goat eyed the Boyar Chef sardonically, jaw working. \"Look at\nthat long-nosed son!\" The goat gave a derisive bleat and took another\nmouthful of ripe grain.\n\"Did you see that?\" Georges yelled. \"They've trained the son of a\u2014\"\n\"Chin up, Georges,\" Retief said. \"We'll take up the goat problem along\nwith the rest.\"\n\"I'll murder 'em!\"\n\"Hold it, Georges. Look over there.\"\nA hundred yards away, a trio of brown-cloaked horsemen topped a rise,\npaused dramatically against the cloudless pale sky, then galloped\ndown the slope toward the car, rifles bobbing at their backs, cloaks\nbillowing out behind. Side by side they rode, through the brown-golden\ngrain, cutting three narrow swaths that ran in a straight sweep from\nthe ridge to the air-car where Retief and the Chef d'Regime hovered,\nwaiting.\nGeorges scrambled for the side of the car. \"Just wait 'til I get my\nhands on him!\"\nRetief pulled him back. \"Sit tight and look pleased, Georges. Never\ngive the opposition a hint of your true feelings. Pretend you're a goat\nlover\u2014and hand me one of your cigars.\"\nThe three horsemen pulled up in a churn of chaff and a clatter of\npebbles. Georges coughed, batting a hand at the settling dust. Retief\npeeled the cigar unhurriedly, sniffed, at it and thumbed it alight. He\ndrew at it, puffed out a cloud of smoke and glanced casually at the\ntrio of Aga Kagan cavaliers.\n\"Peace be with you,\" he intoned in accent-free Kagan. \"May your shadows\nnever grow less.\"\nThe leader of the three, a hawk-faced man with a heavy beard,\nunlimbered his rifle. He fingered it, frowning ferociously.\n\"Have no fear,\" Retief said, smiling graciously. \"He who comes as a\nguest enjoys perfect safety.\"\nA smooth-faced member of the threesome barked an oath and leveled his\nrifle at Retief.\n\"Youth is the steed of folly,\" Retief said. \"Take care that the\nbeardless one does not disgrace his house.\"\nThe leader whirled on the youth and snarled an order. He lowered the\nrifle, muttering. Blackbeard turned back to Retief.\n\"Begone, interlopers,\" he said. \"You disturb the goats.\"\n\"Provision is not taken to the houses of the generous,\" Retief said.\n\"May the creatures dine well ere they move on.\"\n\"Hah! The goats of the Aga Kaga graze on the lands of the Aga Kaga.\"\nThe leader edged his horse close, eyed Retief fiercely. \"We welcome no\nintruders on our lands.\"\n\"To praise a man for what he does not possess is to make him appear\nfoolish,\" Retief said. \"These are the lands of the Boyars. But enough\nof these pleasantries. We seek audience with your ruler.\"\n\"You may address me as 'Exalted One',\" the leader said. \"Now dismount\nfrom that steed of Shaitan.\"\n\"It is written, if you need anything from a dog, call him 'sir',\"\nRetief said. \"I must decline to impute canine ancestry to a guest. Now\nyou may conduct us to your headquarters.\"\n\"Enough of your insolence!\" The bearded man cocked his rifle. \"I could\nblow your heads off!\"\n\"The hen has feathers, but it does not fly,\" Retief said. \"We have\nasked for escort. A slave must be beaten with a stick; for a free man,\na hint is enough.\"\n\"You mock me, pale one. I warn you\u2014\"\n\"Only love makes me weep,\" Retief said. \"I laugh at hatred.\"\n\"Get out of the car!\"\nRetief puffed at his cigar, eyeing the Aga Kagan cheerfully. The youth\nin the rear moved forward, teeth bared.\n\"Never give in to the fool, lest he say, 'He fears me,'\" Retief said.\n\"I cannot restrain my men in the face of your insults,\" the bearded Aga\nKagan roared. \"These hens of mine have feathers\u2014and talons as well!\"\n\"When God would destroy an ant, he gives him wings,\" Retief said.\n\"Distress in misfortune is another misfortune.\"\nThe bearded man's face grew purple.\nRetief dribbled the ash from his cigar over the side of the car.\n\"Now I think we'd better be getting on,\" he said briskly. \"I've enjoyed\nour chat, but we do have business to attend to.\"\nThe bearded leader laughed shortly. \"Does the condemned man beg for the\naxe?\" he enquired rhetorically. \"You shall visit the Aga Kaga, then.\nMove on! And make no attempt to escape, else my gun will speak you a\nbrief farewell.\"\nThe horsemen glowered, then, at a word from the leader, took positions\naround the car. Georges started the vehicle forward, following the\nleading rider. Retief leaned back and let out a long sigh.\n\"That was close,\" he said. \"I was about out of proverbs.\"\n\"You sound as though you'd brought off a coup,\" Georges said. \"From the\nexpression on the whiskery one's face, we're in for trouble. What was\nhe saying?\"\n\"Just a routine exchange of bluffs,\" Retief said. \"Now when we get\nthere, remember to make your flattery sound like insults and your\ninsults sound like flattery, and you'll be all right.\"\n\"These birds are armed. And they don't like strangers,\" Georges said.\n\"Maybe I should have boned up on their habits before I joined this\nexpedition.\"\n\"Just stick to the plan,\" Retief said. \"And remember: a handful of luck\nis better than a camel-load of learning.\"\nThe air car followed the escort down a long slope to a dry river bed\nand across it, through a barren stretch of shifting sand to a green\noasis set with canopies.\nThe armed escort motioned the car to a halt before an immense tent of\nglistening black. Before the tent armed men lounged under a pennant\nbearing a lion\ncouchant\nin crimson on a field verte.\n\"Get out,\" Blackbeard ordered. The guards eyed the visitors, their\ndrawn sabers catching sunlight. Retief and Georges stepped from the\ncar onto rich rugs spread on the grass. They followed the ferocious\ngesture of the bearded man through the opening into a perfumed interior\nof luminous shadows. A heavy odor of incense hung in the air, and the\nstrumming of stringed instruments laid a muted pattern of sound behind\nthe decorations of gold and blue, silver and green. At the far end of\nthe room, among a bevy of female slaves, a large and resplendently clad\nman with blue-black hair and a clean-shaven chin popped a grape into\nhis mouth. He wiped his fingers negligently on a wisp of silk offered\nby a handmaiden, belched loudly and looked the callers over.\nBlackbeard cleared his throat. \"Down on your faces in the presence of\nthe Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of East and West.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Retief said firmly. \"My hay-fever, you know.\"\nThe reclining giant waved a hand languidly.\n\"Never mind the formalities,\" he said. \"Approach.\"\nRetief and Georges crossed the thick rugs. A cold draft blew toward\nthem. The reclining man sneezed violently, wiped his nose on another\nsilken scarf and held up a hand.\n\"Night and the horses and the desert know me,\" he said in resonant\ntones. \"Also the sword and the guest and paper and pen\u2014\" He\npaused, wrinkled his nose and sneezed again. \"Turn off that damned\nair-conditioner,\" he snapped.\nHe settled himself and motioned the bearded man to him. The two\nexchanged muted remarks. Then the bearded man stepped back, ducked his\nhead and withdrew to the rear.\n\"Excellency,\" Retief said, \"I have the honor to present M. Georges\nDuror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government.\"\n\"Planetary government?\" The Aga Kaga spat grape seeds on the rug. \"My\nmen have observed a few squatters along the shore. If they're in\ndistress, I'll see about a distribution of goat-meat.\"\n\"It is the punishment of the envious to grieve at anothers' plenty,\"\nRetief said. \"No goat-meat will be required.\"\n\"Ralph told me you talk like a page out of Mustapha ben Abdallah Katib\nJelebi,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"I know a few old sayings myself. For\nexample, 'A Bedouin is only cheated once.'\"\n\"We have no such intentions, Excellency,\" Retief said. \"Is it not\nwritten, 'Have no faith in the Prince whose minister cheats you'?\"\n\"I've had some unhappy experiences with strangers,\" the Aga Kaga said.\n\"It is written in the sands that all strangers are kin. Still, he who\nvisits rarely is a welcome guest. Be seated.\"\nIII\nHandmaidens brought cushions, giggled and fled. Retief and Georges\nsettled themselves comfortably. The Aga Kaga eyed them in silence.\n\"We have come to bear tidings from the Corps Diplomatique\nTerrestrienne,\" Retief said solemnly. A perfumed slave girl offered\ngrapes.\n\"Modest ignorance is better than boastful knowledge,\" the Aga Kaga\nsaid. \"What brings the CDT into the picture?\"\n\"The essay of the drunkard will be read in the tavern,\" Retief said.\n\"Whereas the words of kings....\"\n\"Very well, I concede the point.\" The Aga Kaga waved a hand at the\nserving maids. \"Depart, my dears. Attend me later. You too, Ralph.\nThese are mere diplomats. They are men of words, not deeds.\"\nThe bearded man glared and departed. The girls hurried after him.\n\"Now,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"Let's drop the wisdom of the ages and\nget down to the issues. Not that I don't admire your repertoire of\nplatitudes. How do you remember them all?\"\n\"Diplomats and other liars require good memories,\" said Retief. \"But\nas you point out, small wisdom to small minds. I'm here to effect a\nsettlement of certain differences between yourself and the planetary\nauthorities. I have here a Note, which I'm conveying on behalf of the\nSector Under-Secretary. With your permission, I'll read it.\"\n\"Go ahead.\" The Aga Kaga kicked a couple of cushions onto the floor,\neased a bottle from under the couch and reached for glasses.\n\"The Under-Secretary for Sector Affairs presents his compliments to his\nExcellency, the Aga Kaga of the Aga Kaga, Primary Potentate, Hereditary\nSheik, Emir of the\u2014\"\n\"Yes, yes.

After all, it's what you gentlemen\nare paid for. Cheers.\"\n\"Your Excellency has a lucid way of putting things,\" Retief said.\n\"Call me Stanley,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"The other routine is just to\nplease some of the old fools\u2014I mean the more conservative members\nof my government. They're still gnawing their beards and kicking\nthemselves because their ancestors dropped science in favor of alchemy\nand got themselves stranded in a cultural dead end. This charade is\nsupposed to prove they were right all along. However, I've no time\nto waste in neurotic compensations. I have places to go and deeds to\naccomplish.\"\n\"At first glance,\" Retief said, \"it looks as though the places are\nalready occupied, and the deeds are illegal.\"\nThe Aga Kaga guffawed. \"For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Have\nanother drink.\" He poured, eyeing Georges. \"What of M. Duror? How does\nhe feel about it?\"\nGeorges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. \"Not bad,\" he said. \"But\nnot quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.\"\nThe Aga Kaga snorted. \"I thought the goats were overdoing it a bit\nmyself,\" he said. \"Still, the graybeards insisted. And I need their\nsupport.\"\n\"Also,\" Georges said distinctly, \"I think you're soft. You lie around\nletting women wait on you, while your betters are out doing an honest\nday's work.\"\nThe Aga Kaga looked startled. \"Soft? I can tie a knot in an iron bar\nas big as your thumb.\" He popped a grape into his mouth. \"As for the\nrest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childish\nas my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing. As for\nmyself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the end\none will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my years\nare numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well,\nhunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to others\nthe arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.\"\n\"You admit you're here to grab our land, then,\" Georges said. \"That's\nthe damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression\u2014\"\n\"Ah, ah!\" The Aga Kaga held up a hand. \"Watch your vocabulary, my\ndear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial\nself-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Or\npossibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly\nexploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition,\nan activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle of\nColonial Imperialism.\"\n\"Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notorious\nplanet-grabbers in Sector history, you\u2014you\u2014\"\n\"Call me Stanley.\" The Aga Kaga munched a grape. \"I merely face the\nrealities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter of\nhistorical association. Some people can grab land and pass it off\nlightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely for\nholding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends.\nAnd I shall continue to take every advantage of it.\"\n\"We'll fight you!\" Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey\nand slammed the glass down. \"You won't take this world without a\nstruggle!\"\n\"Another?\" the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered as\nhis glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.\n\"Excellent color, don't you agree?\" He turned his eyes on Georges.\n\"It's pointless to resist,\" he said. \"We have you outgunned and\noutmanned. Your small nation has no chance against us. But we're\nprepared to be generous. You may continue to occupy such areas as we do\nnot immediately require until such time as you're able to make other\narrangements.\"\n\"And by the time we've got a crop growing out of what was bare rock,\nyou'll be ready to move in,\" the Boyar Chef d'Regime snapped. \"But\nyou'll find that we aren't alone!\"\n\"Quite alone,\" the Aga said. He nodded sagely. \"Yes, one need but read\nthe lesson of history. The Corps Diplomatique will make expostulatory\nnoises, but it will accept the\nfait accompli\n. You, my dear sir, are\nbut a very small nibble. We won't make the mistake of excessive greed.\nWe shall inch our way to empire\u2014and those who stand in our way shall\nbe dubbed warmongers.\"\n\"I see you're quite a student of history, Stanley,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder if you recall the eventual fate of most of the would-be empire\nnibblers of the past?\"\n\"Ah, but they grew incautious. They went too far, too fast.\"\n\"The confounded impudence,\" Georges rasped. \"Tells us to our face what\nhe has in mind!\"\n\"An ancient and honorable custom, from the time of\nMein Kampf\nand\nthe\nCommunist Manifesto\nthrough the\nPorcelain Wall\nof Leung. Such\ndeclarations have a legendary quality. It's traditional that they're\nnever taken at face value.\"\n\"But always,\" Retief said, \"there was a critical point at which the man\non horseback could have been pulled from the saddle.\"\n\"\nCould\nhave been,\" the Aga Kaga chuckled. He finished the grapes and\nbegan peeling an orange. \"But they never were. Hitler could have been\nstopped by the Czech Air Force in 1938; Stalin was at the mercy of the\nprimitive atomics of the west in 1946; Leung was grossly over-extended\nat Rangoon.

Have a banana.\"\n\"You're stretching your analogy a little too far,\" Retief said. \"You're\nbanking on the inaction of the Corps. You could be wrong.\"\n\"I shall know when to stop,\" the Aga Kaga said.\n\"Tell me, Stanley,\" Retief said, rising. \"Are we quite private here?\"\n\"Yes, perfectly so,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"None would dare to intrude in\nmy council.\" He cocked an eyebrow at Retief. \"You have a proposal to\nmake in confidence? But what of our dear friend Georges? One would not\nlike to see him disillusioned.\"\n\"Don't worry about Georges. He's a realist, like you. He's prepared to\ndeal in facts. Hard facts, in this case.\"\nThe Aga Kaga nodded thoughtfully. \"What are you getting at?\"\n\"You're basing your plan of action on the certainty that the Corps will\nsit by, wringing its hands, while you embark on a career of planetary\npiracy.\"\n\"Isn't it the custom?\" the Aga Kaga smiled complacently.\n\"I have news for you, Stanley. In this instance, neck-wringing seems\nmore in order than hand-wringing.\"\nThe Aga Kaga frowned. \"Your manner\u2014\"\n\"Never mind our manners!\" Georges blurted, standing. \"We don't need any\nlessons from goat-herding land-thieves!\"\nThe Aga Kaga's face darkened. \"You dare to speak thus to me, pig of a\nmuck-grubber!\"\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "2", "uid": "0a3381cd0b3c4213bebb7dd6957d565d", "response_text": "As the story opens, Retief, the Minister to Flamme, is meeting with other members of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne, including Under-Secretary Sternwheeler and Deputy Under-Secretary Magnan.

The latter recently arrived on Flamme and began taking over land that the Boyars are farming. The Aga Kagans appear to be goat herders, living in tents and allowing their goats to graze on land that the Boyars use for crops, but in reality, the Aga Kagans have weapons, including 40 mm infinite repeaters and rocket launchers. Retief wants to offer the Boyars the support of the Corps, but Sternwheeler will only go so far as to authorize a \u201cstiffly worded Protest Note.\u201d With foresight, Retief has already drafted a note because he anticipated the Corps would respond with paperwork rather than action. \t\n\tRetief travels to Flamme and meets with Georges Duror, the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime. Georges indicates that he has been holding back his men who want to attack the Aga Kagans for taking their land, and Retief reminds Georges that if the Boyars act without backing from the Corps, they are likely to be destroyed. Retief also tells Georges that the goats and tents are just for show; the Aga Kagans have a modern navy and bullet-proof cloaks, and on their home planet, they travel via modern helis and ground cars. Georges seems discouraged by this news, but Retief reminds him he has the Note and asks him to give diplomacy a chance.\n\tRetief and Georges travel to meet with the head of the Aga Kagans to deliver the Note.

Retief introduces Georges as from the Planetary government to the leader, Stanley, and offers to read the Note. He begins with a series of titles until Stanley tells him to skip them. Retief flips two pages and begins a long, legalistic description of relocated people until Stanley cuts him off. Stanley says the Boyars will be accused of imperialism if they attack the Aga Kagans but offers to allow the Boyars to stay until they can make other arrangements.

After the meeting, Magnan invites Retief to a reception later that day with a lot of figure-heads, but Retief wants to get back to Flamme, where he will hopefully keep war from breaking out.  On Flamme, Retief talks to Georges, a Boyar leader. Retief tries to convince Georges to give a diplomatic approach a shot, and advises him on how to proceed. The two of them head out of the capitol, discussing the countryside as Georges expresses his frustration about goats. Retief tries to keep Georges calm and takes his time to unwrap a cigar before he greets the Aga Kagans that approach. After some formalities, Retief explains that they have come to talk with the Aga Kagan leaders. They continue speaking in idioms, but Retief seems to have insulted the Aga Kagans. Retief and Georges eventually make it out of the situation, being led to the Aga Kagan headquarters. Once they arrive, the Aga Kagan known as Blackbeard orders Retief and Georges out of their car, and they are introduced to \"the Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of the East and West\". Then, the discussion in proverbs continues. Retief introduces his friend as \"M. Georges Duror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government\", referring to him as a planetary leader as a power play. This upsets the Aga Kaga, who doesn't consider Georges important. The three eventually sit to discuss the involvement of the Corps, and Retief pulls out the note from the sector's Under-Secretary.

It turns out Stanley is trying to put up an image for his fellow people but isn't as dedicated to the plan as the others.

He has advised Georges about handling the situation with the Aga Kagans, urging him to prevent the Boyars from attacking the Aga Kagans, and Georges trusts Retief to secure assistance for them. Retief is sympathetic to the Boyars and their situation, trying to persuade Under-Secretary Sternwheeler to support them. When Retief tells Georges that he will personally deliver the Note to the Aga Kagans, Georges wants to help Retief and volunteers to go with him; Retief agrees. It is Retief who develops the plan for handling the Aga Kagans. Georges is impulsive, which leads Retief to keep watch on him. When they encounter the goats in the grain field, Retief has to convince Georges not to hurt the animals, and when the horsemen ride through the grain, Retief has to hold him back again. Retief is calmer in stressful situations and reminds Georges of their strategy: to make their flattery sound like insults and their insults sound like flattery. Georges seems unsure of himself and comments that he should have learned more about their habits before accompanying Retief. Retief has to translate what the Aga Kagans say for Georges in order for him to know what is going on. When the two men meet with Stanley, Retief maintains his calm demeanor, while Georges loses his temper."}, {"worker_id": "10", "uid": "08ce9506221e4b6c8e164e2c5a4cbc02", "response_text": "Retief is a diplomatic Minister to Flamme and has strategic plans guiding his desire to see the Boyar continue to inhabit the planet Flamme.

Retief speaks Kagan and is well-versed in their cultural norms, which is very useful for the purposes of negotiation. It also makes him very adept at making the Aga Kagans angry, which he does as soon as they encounter each other.

For sixty years, the Boyars inhabited the planet by themselves, with only the saurian wildlife presenting a danger to them. Flamme is now a thriving planet. It has a Government House with comfortable lounge furniture, waiters in white jackets, colorful flowers, a lake, a lawn, and colorful flowerbeds. It also has beautiful sunsets. Outside the capital, there are rolling hills of granite. Flamme\u2019s main industry seems to be agriculture; fifty years ago they had bare rock, but they bred special strains of bacteria that broke the rock down to soil where they raised legumes and then grains. The Boyars also have oyster breeding beds. There are roads, although they have pot-holes, and air-cars for transportation. The Aga Kaban headquarters is a large black tent featuring air conditioning and a pennant featuring a lion \u201ccouchant in crimson on a field verte.\u201d It has the smell of incense, and someone is playing stringed instruments inside.

When the Boyars settled the planet sixty years ago, it was habitable but unable to support much agriculture. They have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme, clearing jungles, descumming seas, irrigating deserts, and planting forests. Fifty years ago, the Boyars learned how to breed a special strain of bacteria that breaks down the granite that covered much of the surface. The granite breaks down to soil, and the Boyars add broad-spectrum fertilizer to make the land arable. The Boyars now have many fields of crops and are continuing to develop new sections for more. Their many years of intensive work in creating farming land and growing crops gives them a vested interest in their settlement.\nThe Aga Kagans are involved in empire-building. They have sent what appear to be goat herders and fishermen to Flamme to begin taking over the land. The goat herders are all male and have rocket launchers. They present a false appearance as homesteaders who lack access to modern technology; in reality, their tents are high-polymer plastic, and their robes are bullet-proof. On their home planet, they have helis and ground cars. The homesteaders set up camp in the middle of farm fields, allow their goats to graze on the crops, and cook their sheep\u2019s brains over dung fires. The fishermen are actually the Aga Kagan navy who come equipped with 40 mm infinite repeaters.

Stanley admits the Aga Kagans move into an area after others have done the hard work of building the community and civilization so that the Aga Kagans can enjoy the fruits of the others\u2019 labors.

Where you at, Gus?\"\nThe gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.\nThree generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest\na trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.\nWhat set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had\napparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen\nthrough the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by\nEarth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all\nvisitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa\nprovokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat\nof your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\nThe official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and\nchuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people\nwho wish to leave.

He was a fairly\nyoung man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed\nhead that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago\nthat no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class\ncitizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to\nhire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen.

He stamped the\npassport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel\nanywhere in the Protectorates.

Good-by.\"\nHe backed out of the office.\nA dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in\npajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept\nhim against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a\nhundred feet down at the river of automobiles.\nPhobos!\nhe thought\nwildly.\nIf the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin\nbefore I hit the pavement!\nThe August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see\nneither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of\nmulti-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more\nacreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he\nused to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a\npipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the\ntemperature wasn't too far below zero.\nWhy did they tap me for this job?\nhe asked himself in a surge of\nhomesickness.\nWhat the hell is the Martian Embassy here for?\nHe, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of\nsociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised\nhis government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his\nidea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and\nhis mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an\noccasional trip to Swindletown\u2014\nMy God\n, thought Matheny,\nhere I am, one solitary outlander in the\ngreatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm\nsupposed to find my planet a con man!\nHe began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and\nblack culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty\nyears out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,\nbut he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him\nwhenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had\ngone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could\nname on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before\nMars had such machines. If ever.\nThe city roared at him.\nHe fumbled after his pipe.\nOf course\n, he told himself,\nthat's why\nthe Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.\nPlease, sir, where can I contact the underworld?\nHe wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian\nRepublic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the\nrambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article\nwas a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,\nwithout being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend\nwho was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a\nfew spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge\nto work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But\nmore, he would have been among people he understood.\nThe frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to\nexist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding\nhis syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer\nagainst, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency.\nMatheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight\non them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any\nindividual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one\nthat was distinguished by relative austerity.\nTHE CHURCH OF CHOICE\nEnter, Play, Pray\nThat would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet\nof altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a\nmarble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black\nleotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The\nrestaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\"To your left, sir.\"\nThe Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an\nanimated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series\nof rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\"Hm?\" said Matheny.\nShe explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a\nfifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the\nmartini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.\nHe stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning\nsomething new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest\nor too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\nHe had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the\ncongregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few\npasses he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.\nBut when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a\ncustomary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed\nchips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple\ncourtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the\nfeel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the\ngreen table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously\nsurgical bodice.\n\"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually\nplaying\n? What happened to the\ncocked dice?\"\nThe lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!\nThis is a church!\"\n\"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,\nshuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed\nhis knotting tongue.\nDamn it, just because they're so much more\nsophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler?\nThe helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and\nsleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell\ncloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone\nMatheny had yet heard.\n\"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his\nhand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I\nforgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want\nto g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\nMatheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\nThey walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what\nremained of his winnings.\n\"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met\na Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small\nembassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother\nplanet and so on.\"\n\"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and\ndistance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for\npleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the\nshaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,\nat least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few\ntourists to us?\"\n\"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they\ncall City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my\ngirl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was\njust gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,\nmade a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she\nappreciated\nme for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\"Oh,\" said Matheny.\nHe felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to\ndeserve\u2014\n\"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists\nit's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what\ncan we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I\nmean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but\npeople come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough\nair to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and\nvillages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and\nmaking a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for\ntheir ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying\nto make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods\nand seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment\nand supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't\nexport enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\nBy that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;\nGrill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic\ntechnician before?\"\n\"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\nMatheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for\npurely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain\nreduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\nMatheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But\nyou don't think we'd\ndrink\nit, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it\ndoesn't absolutely\nruin\nvermouth. But we don't see those Earthside\ncommercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\"\n\"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You\nknow, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He\nraised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you\ncontrol the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,\nwhy do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have\nbeen paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales\nengineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,\nand the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate\nEarth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery\non Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old\nMartian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges\nand the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and\nso on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our\ntravel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has\nto be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of\nthe money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only\none has been really successful\u2014\nI Was a Slave Girl on Mars\n.\n\"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.\nAgain, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors\nnever have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high\npercentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you\nknow, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed\nabsolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start\nshopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big\nbusiness, I have heard.\"\n\"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.\nMartian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a\nsweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\"\nDoran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,\nanyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried\nto, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal\nconcessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport\nfirm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few\ndollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter\nas security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.\nBut who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more\nof. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political\nmalcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of\nliberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics\nhope to get from Mars?\"\n\"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary\nfreight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\nDoran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very\nfrank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\nMatheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to\nevery economist.\"\nOf course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for\ninstance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our\nneed; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough.\nThe beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a\nwhiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the\nMartian.\n\"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\"A pleasure.\"\n\"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with\nthe situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\"Oh, we're not\nthat\npoor! My expense allowance assumes I will\nentertain quite a bit.\"\nDoran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,\nthen?\"\n\"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business\nmanager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault\nthere are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et\ncetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\"\nMatheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama\ntop. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are\nbabes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the\nscale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy\nand sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford\nthree seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we\nneed, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an\nEarthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and\nhow to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that\nsort of, uh, thing.\"\nMatheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second\nbottle of beer.\n\"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote\nhim anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get\nto see\u2014\"\n\"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just\nmight. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's\nEarth years, mind you.\"\n\"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not\nbad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer\nYork. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit\nwhere he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars\npermanently.\"\n\"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That\nis, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses\nand, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\nDoran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the\nEarthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\nMatheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A\nhell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance\nbusiness consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange\nsome contacts....\n\"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary\nfriendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have\ngot to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is\nakvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\nA hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and\nhe laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a\nbig-city taste like his.\n\"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what\nMars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\"A what?\"\n\"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game\nfor us and make us some real money.\"\n\"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit.\nDoran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me\nstrangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth\nseemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an\nodd quality.\n\"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb\nout of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some\ngaiety.\"\n\"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room\nfirst and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\"\nAllez\n,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean\nallons\n, or maybe\nalors\n.\"\nThe drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered\nhim; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.\nOh, well\n, he thought,\nif I succeed in this job, no one at home will\nquibble.\nAnd the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular\nenough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to\nshow the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his\ncontours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but\nhis face burned. \"I see.\"\n\"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered\nhimself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a\ncigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not\ntoo late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around\n2100 hours earliest.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and\nswivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?\nExotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"\nHis tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened\nuncertain lips.\n\"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an\nabandoned canal.\"\n\"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does\nshe?\"\n\"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend\nyou buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\"\nWhile Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with\nhis new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a\nslipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And\nmaybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\nDoran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.\n\"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of\ncontacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,\nsay, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not\ndo it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you\na phone number.\"\nHe shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not\nbe interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I\ngot tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have\ngot to think positively.\"\nMatheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him\nwant to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe\nhe became overcautious.\nThey had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he\nsaid slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that\nhe had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\nIn the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.\nDoran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an\ninstant's hesitation.\n\"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever\nyou may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he\nrecited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the\nhonest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry\nto\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.\nMaybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,\nI might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go\nahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are\noperating con games.\"\n\"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty\nyears ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been\nmanufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\"\nHuh?\nWell, why, but\u2014\"\n\"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary\nhaul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars\nand they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\"I will be clopped! Good for you!\"\nDoran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even\nwithout security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny\napologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a\nmathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected\nEarth coins.\"\n\"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck\npiece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"\nMatheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his\nback. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal\ndisease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.\n'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was\nthe secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful\nsemantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available\nto a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\nHe would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it\nwould have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who\nhad heard everything already.\nDoran whistled.\n\"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our\nonly hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian\nbucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may.

Armed with a hundred million dollars, his real mission is to find and enlist the service of a con man who can help the Martians concoct a securities scheme that will net greater profits than their current exports yield (the government hired him because of his experience formulating the Red Ankh Society scheme, which offered to sell bogus wisdom of the Old Martians). Peter is accustomed to the largely-empty deserts of Mars and enjoys the serenity of smoking a pipe while stargazing behind his small home in addition to other quiet hobbies such as reading, playing chess, and collecting minerals. When he arrives on Earth, he feels out of his element and uncomfortable due to the heavy, humid air and massive towers and neon lights he encounters in the crowded city, so he seeks a place where he can sit. He finds a place called \"The Church of Choice,\" where, to his delight, he discovers a number of gambling games in progress despite the ban on such activities on Earth. Because the Martian Constitution specifically allows for gambling, Peter partakes and shoots a successful game of craps. However, he expresses confusion about Earth rules for craps, since the Martian version employs a number of tricks and cheats. After the game, Peter feels uncomfortable again and tries to leave, but he is stopped by a man named Gus Doran, who takes him out for drinks. During their conversation, Peter tells Gus about the struggles of the Martian economy and explains how high Earth taxes and greedy middlemen have cut into the profits from their exports. Over the course of a few more drinks, Peter tells Gus about several frauds the Martians developed in an effort to bolster their economy and accidentally reveals his true intentions for visiting Earth to Gus. This information intrigues Gus who informs Peter that he has contacts that may be able to help. To ensure Peter's trust, Gus uses an oath box and promises not to tell anyone what he learned from Peter that night. Gus then suggests they celebrate by inviting some women to their hotel, and he leaves to make a phone call. He calls his business partner Peri, who is preparing to go on a date with a wealthy marijuana rancher.

She agrees.\n\nPeter Matheny arrives at the United Protectorates on Earth and shows his paperwork to enter the country. He is there on a recruiting mission, and the official advises him to head to the rural areas because no one in the cities would ever leave Earth. Peter walks through the city and wonders why he has been given this assignment. He\u2019s a professor of sociodynamics, and although he has advised the Martian government before, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s equipped for the gig.

Matheny appreciates Doran\u2019s company, and the two discuss tourism between Earth and Mars. Matheny focuses on the Martian economy and the need to build it up by attracting more Earth dollars. Mars makes very little money on its exports due to taxes, shipping fees, and so forth, and few tourists from Earth go there because they know the air is harder to breathe, and there are no big cities with entertainment venues, just small towns, villages, and ranches amidst scrub and desert. Mars has dabbled in multiple business ventures to make money, but most have yielded little profit. Matheny tells Doran that what Mars really wants is to operate a sweepstakes.

They grab a drink at Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, but not before Matheny had already blabbed about half his business. Doran covers the drinks: a beer for Matheny and a whiskey sour for himself. They drink and talk about the Martian economy and how their goods may be pricey, but the real profit is nowhere near as high. Matheny, a little tipsy, tells Doran that they\u2019re looking for an Earth executive, someone who\u2019d make a hundred megabucks a year on a five-year contract. He mentions as well that he has extra money for expenses on Earth, which draws Doran in. Doran reveals he has connections, so Matheny tells him they need a con man. \nThey leave for the Jupiter-Astoria where they encounter sexual chairs. Doran suggests they get a girl, most likely with Peri in mind, and he tells Matheny to get some new clothes. Doran tells Matheny again he has contacts, so Matheny makes him swear under an oath box before he will reveal their true secrets. After, Matheny tells him about their schemes, from the Red Ankh Society to Junie O\u2019Brien. Doran thinks he has the man for Matheny, but first, he suggests going to the bar to celebrate with a girl. \n"}]}, {"question_text": "What is the setting of the story?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "8", "uid": "233c7980b9e241c8a76f35cc2eba25fe", "response_text": "There are several locations where key events in the story take place including Peri's residence, the immigration office, the Earth city, the Church of Choice, Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, and the Jupiter-Astoria hotel. In addition, at various points throughout the narrative, Peter recalls life on Mars, which is covered with deserts and scrub thorn and an atmosphere with drier air and lesser gravity compared to Earth's humidity and strong gravitation. Martian society is largely rural with very small towns and villages, and their weeks are different than those on Earth; they have a day called \"Tenthday\" when Peter likes to play poker with his coworkers, and he sometimes visits a place called Swindletown. Peter often notes the differences between Earth's commercialism and reliance upon automation and Mars' more calm, individualistic society. Peter is overwhelmed by the bright, neon lights, massive towers, and sheer amount of vehicles and people in the city where he arrives on Earth and longs for his small cottage and rock garden back on Mars. To navigate the city, Peter takes cabs, and to access the different levels of the towers, he utilizes the ramp system. Looking for a place to sit, Peter finds The Church of Choice, which seems to be an establishment where people can drink and gamble, although gambling is illegal on Earth. The Church of Choice features craps tables, roulette wheels, and even Bingo and has a large, marble lobby at its entrance that leads into a number of dim rooms with Gothic architecture. After meeting Gus there, the two leave and share drinks at Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, a place where diners can talk in private sitting at soundproof booths while enjoying a strip show. The carpeted hotel room he shares with Gus at the Jupiter-Astoria has a pneumatic device that can deliver drinks straight from the bar along with anything else someone may require, such as the oath box Gus uses to cement Peter's trust in him.

The sky is impossible to see because of the pollution, and the hundreds of buildings are incredibly tall. \n\nPeter refers to Earth as the \"greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen,\" and everywhere he turns he sees businesses that make loads of money and people opening up their wallets for a good time.

Later, Peter checks into the Jupiter-Astoria hotel and is impressed by the sexy furniture and expensive-looking fixtures. \n\nEarth is essentially the exact opposite of Mars, where people live in small cottages and have a difficult time making money.

There is a lively entertainment industry with nightclubs, bars, strip clubs, etc., in large cities like Newer York. There are provincial, less industrialized regions as well, such as Russia and Congolese Belgium, which some people refer to as the sticks.   \t\nOn Mars, life is more peaceful. Matheny enjoys the quiet rock garden behind his cottage where he can smoke his pipe with Orion for company\u2014when the temperature isn\u2019t too far below zero. People who live there have changed to have longer legs and an expanded chest as a result of the gravity, and the atmosphere makes it harder to hear sounds. Mars has a civilized society with universities, a central government, and specialized organizations such as the Red Ankh Society. Mars lacks much of the technology that exists on Earth, specifically the automation to bring any service you want to you on a twenty-four-hour basis. On Mars, gambling is legal, in part because it relieves the sheer boredom of the deserts. People cheat, and organizations offering gambling have systems that astute players can figure out. Matheny frequently mentions that Mars has a dollar shortage or is poor and suggests that Earth should send tourists to Mars, but Doran points out that the people who do go to Mars come back and complain that there is barely enough air to survive there and that there are no cities, just small towns, villages, and ranches. The landscape is mainly dust, sand, and thorn scrub. Mars needs equipment and supplies from Earth. Whatever Mars exports to Earth requires enormous costs to ship, and after wholesalers and retailers, salespeople, advertisers, and taxes are paid, there is very little profit left.

TROY\nA world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\nWhen Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\nglobe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories November 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\nOn Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\nCaldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n\"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n\"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n\"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n\"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n\"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n\"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n\"They\nare\nbeautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\nFor an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\nJohnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n\"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\"\n\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\nSombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\nThere would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\nIn this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n\"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n\"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\"You have decided them?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Every last one of them?\"\n\"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n\"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n\"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\nhe\nmight be there.\n\"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n\"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\nIn the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\nThe trumpets flared again.\nOn one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\nVee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\nShe gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n\"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\"But\u2014\"\n\"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n\"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\nShe was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\"What way?\"\nHer eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\nMoving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\nII\nIt was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\nThe soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\nThe music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\nVee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"How would I know?\"\n\"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\"But\u2014\"\n\"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n\"Hell\u2014\"\n\"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n\"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\nHe looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\nAgain she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\nA gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\nThe fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n\"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\nJohnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n\"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\nTrue, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\nThe music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\nUnger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\nJohnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers\nsought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He\ncaught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened\nand became a rock.\nJohnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light\nhad been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the\nimpassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three\nhundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe\nthat would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the\nspotlight as if by magic.\nVee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\nNo human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\nUnger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound\npassed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself\nflat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently\nwent to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest\ntake on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\nThe music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers\ndug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for\nprotection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She\ndrew closer to him.\nA few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able\nto take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was\nsuddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she\nhad suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\nUnder the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer\nlay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his\nbreath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation\nwas senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he\nsensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this\nway, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these\nRooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself\nwas not prepared to disagree.\nAround him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...\ngoing.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience\nto them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\nThe Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,\nperhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music\nand the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else\nthat sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium\nsmokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.\nHe was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...\nwatching a space ship float in an endless void\n.\nAs Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into\nhis vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,\nthe sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and\nCaldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not\nin the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he\nknew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out\non the periphery of his universe, perhaps of\nthe\nuniverse.\nAll he saw was the space ship.\nIt was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen\nin his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\nBack when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off\nstars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his\ndestiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was\nthis night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\nThe vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and\nthrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now\nhe was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\nHe started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who\nwas Vee Vee?\nThe fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship\nvanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,\nat Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on\nhis arm.\n\"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\"See what?\"\n\"The space ship!\"\n\"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.\n\"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact\nwith my dream.\"\n\"Your dream?\"\nHe asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,\nand look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of\nsound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left\ntold him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The\nVenusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat\nof hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a\nhigh-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had\nnot heard it before in this place.\nHe thought about the space ship he had seen.\nThe vision would not come.\nHe shook his head and tried again.\nBeside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a\nwoman in love.\nHe tried again for the space ship.\nIt would not come.\nAnger came up instead.\nSomehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept\nintruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\nSo far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not\ndreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\nHis gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\nCold flowed over him.\nUnger was slowly rising from the mat.\nThe bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward!\nIII\nAn invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here\nand there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting\nhim.\n\"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to\nVenus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.\nAnother voice took its place.\n\"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...\nthis is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian\nDreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,\ncan float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.\nWe are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian\nBuddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our\nmaster saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some\nother sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\"I am your thyroid. I....\"\nA multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if\nthe parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to\nhim what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days\nwhen he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\nThe little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,\nMaster! Do something.\"\n\"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,\nif action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we\ncan all die.\"\n\"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go\ntogether.\"\nThe chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the\nlittle voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\"Please!\" Johnson said.\nIn the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\nThe Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see\nthem. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that\nforce. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a\nVenusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\nA wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\nUnger fell.\nHe was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,\nbody-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\nThere was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The\nsilence went. Voices came.\n\"Who did that?\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked\nthe voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the\nmeaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At\nhis left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was\nback in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as\nif some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\nOn Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up\naround his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came\nhungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\nJohnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back\nof the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of\nVenusians were attacking a man.\n\"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He\nis\nhere!\"\nIn Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired\nblindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft\nthrob of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\nStruck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But\nthere seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had\nslid out of his sight.\n\"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important\none.\"\nZit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.\nJohnson followed.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "9", "uid": "e51ec4518f4e41589bc65102d4de1ffc", "response_text": "Jonny Johnson is one of Earth\u2019s foremost scientists, but no one on Venus is supposed to know that.

As they stand to enter the open doors, Vee Vee uses the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him, and it almost works, until Johnson pinches her shoulder and injures her in return. They flirt a little more, then enter the room. As they sit down on their cushioned spot, Vee Vee clings onto him in fear and reveals that his ability to defend himself from the Karmer nerve block proved his identity to her. She knows who he is, Johnny Johnson, and reveals it. \nUnger suddenly appears and promptly goes to sleep. Though they struggle at first with falling asleep, they both do and Johnson sees a spaceship in his dream. Suddenly, he wakes up to Vee Vee grabbing his arm, claiming he woke her up. He hears a strange whirring, which prevents him from falling back into his old dream. He sees Unger begin to float in the air. His body responds, his nerves talking to him, his adrenal gland, his skin. Johnson\u2019s body reacts as his mind does, too. The whole room wakes up thanks to a human\u2019s scream and Unger comes crashing onto the ground. Vee Vee kisses Johnson, as he pulls out his zit gun, a non-lethal weapon. He and Caldwell start shooting at the mass of people attacking the man, who they have discovered is Martin. \n"}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "6f3344e72ef94eb3baa4678cc9f20c41", "response_text": "Johnson is a well-known scientist from Earth and an expert in electro-magnetic radiations within the human body. He and his associate Caldwell have traveled to Venus to search for a missing scientist named Martin. Their mission is highly secretive; Johnson and Caldwell do not acknowledge each other publicly although they can communicate through finger taps. Johnson is puzzled when a beautiful Earth woman approaches him in a bar and strikes up a conversation. It is odd for her to be there alone because Venus is not safe for unaccompanied women. Johnson suspects Venus authorities might be aware of his mission and might be using the woman to get to him, but he ultimately disregards this thought because he knows that if the Venusians knew his real mission, they would kill him. When Caldwell comes to the bar to order another drink, he finger-taps a message to Johnson to watch out for the woman and tells him that she was asking for Martin earlier. He also says he thinks Martin is or has been there although he hasn\u2019t seen him. Johnson is stunned when the woman uses the Karmer nerve paralysis move on him, and she claims that when he breaks the move, it confirms his identity for her. She knows his full name and that he is a well-known scientist but says she\u2019ll keep his secrets. During the dreaming, Johnson dreams of a spaceship, which is closely associated with his childhood dreams of traveling to the stars. When he awakens from the dream, he senses that something is off. He hears a whirring sound but can\u2019t place what it is, and he is aware his body is producing adrenalin and preparing for action.

But not for some men and most boys!\nI've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a\ngirl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\njam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\nhusbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet\nVenus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\nBad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\nTwenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\nFamily Problems of the Frontier Woman\n. \"Remember you're\na nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\nI tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\nfront of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\nhammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\ncrews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\nto run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\nreally see the\nEleanor Roosevelt\n!\nIt was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and\nbehind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out\nof sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white\ndoors\u2014on and on and on.\nGee\n, I thought excitedly, this is\none big\nship\n!\nOf course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of\nstars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing\nthat gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in\nThe Boy\nRocketeers\n, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\nSo when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned\nleft. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading\ninward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix\ngoing\npurr-purr-purrty-purr\nin the comforting way big machinery has\nwhen it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the\nway to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were\nportholes on the hull.\nI'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on\nthe transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the\nceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like\nthe dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in\ncase of emergency. I looked for the\nimportant\nthings.\nAs I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't\ndecided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,\nI'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity\nunderfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf\nof Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make\nfaces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\nStill, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the\nwall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block\nthe crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed\ninto the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits\nstanding in them, like those knights they used to have back in the\nMiddle Ages.\n\"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of\ncompanionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass\nwith hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the\nfollowing fashion.\"\nI read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart.\nBoy\n, I said\nto myself,\nI hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get\ninto one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits\nback in Undersea!\nAnd all the time I was alone. That was the best part.\nThen I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers\nnot permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\nI peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\ncould see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\nvelvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\nexisted in the Universe.\nThere wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\ndistance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\nIf I just took one quick look....\nBut I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\nThen I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\nWell! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\nCitizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\ndidn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\nget an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\ncareful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\nmen.\n\"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\ncan't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\nPassport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\nclause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\nthis number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\npertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\nyou will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\nNo matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\nOf course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\nthings. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\nWomen\nlike and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\nmarried. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\nwouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\nStill, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\nwith me. I knew what Sis could say to\nthat\n, but at least it was an\nargument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\nI was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\nthe left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\nmovies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\noff the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\nmust be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\nagainst the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\nMarsbound. I wished I was on that one!\nThen I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\nblank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\nwall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\nThirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\nAnother one of those signs.\nI crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out\nthe stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked\nunder the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get\ninto it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I\nknew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open\nit with. Not even a button you could press.\nThat meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps\nback home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock\ncombinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice\nkey\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\nFor a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million\npossible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and\na hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed\naround my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\nI bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and\nsat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found\nmyself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the\ncold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.\nHe was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that\nlooked hard and soft at the same time.\nHis boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his\nback.\nAnd his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the\ndeep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards\nin New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan\nthat comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His\nhair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long\ncombed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down\nto his shoulders.\nI hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;\nevery man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable\nsoup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the\nblaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,\nwhen I suddenly got scared right through.\nHis eyes.\nThey didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.\nJust coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did\nit, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a\nsurface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it\nopened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting\njumpy enough to splash.\"\nThen he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly\nleather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted\nto my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\nI held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand\nSparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you\nseem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\n\"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come\nfrom Flatfolk ways.\"\n\"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?\nWhat part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\nHe chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the\nlifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a\nsharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a\nboss-minded sister.\"\n\"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \"\nWe're\nfrom Undersea.\"\n\"\nDryhorn\n, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just\nlike on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him\nhow Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when\nthe mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers\nfigured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.\nHe nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were\nbubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just\nabout the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\nHe looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the\nfirst couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I\ntold him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood\nlistening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked\ndisgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World\nCouncil, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after\nthe Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.\nHe almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown\nup in a surfacing boat.\n\"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we\nmight as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,\nshe figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\"How's that?\"\n\"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on\nEarth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way\nback in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with\nthe wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die\nor get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the\nplanets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal\nhusband, he's not much to boast about.\"\nThe stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody\nanura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a\nbellyful!\"\nHe told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been\nable to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little\nislands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a\nsurplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive\nplanet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in\nschool used to say.\nThe moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had\nto register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he\nthrew a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something\nnasty about the length of his hair; and\nimagine\n!\u2014he not only\nresisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he\nsassed the judge in open court!\n\"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female\nattorneys. Told\nher\nthat where\nI\ncame from, a man spoke his piece\nwhen he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That.

Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken\nmother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.\nMy pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking\nfor me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit.

When I did, I was almost ill.\n\"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?\nAnd I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\nHe leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\n\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days?

We're in this together.\"\nHe guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found\nmyself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis\ninsists such things have always had for men.\n\"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll\ncall you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\nI liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a\nblaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the\neighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named\nall us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the\nname they were saving for a girl.\"\n\"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\nHe grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they\nwere all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all\nexcept me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.\nTook a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down\nthe Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\nI walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of\nthe blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with\nthat, Mr. Butt?\"\n\"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at\nthe light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government\npaddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,\nviolence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,\nnow\u2014\"\nHe had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother\nwhen the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a\ngrowing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very\noff-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh\nfruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat\nand Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\nTrouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have\nbeen pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way\nto handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things\nlike seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.\nTwice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering\nand I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things\nabout Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\nI learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the\nnative Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference\nbetween a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the\nslaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,\nButt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it\nso carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from\nthe tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no\nmatter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in\nthe control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look\nat it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the\ngiant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown\nenough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the\ntime to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're\nplain too young to be even near it.\"\n\"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even\nhave an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.\nAll I have is Sis. And\nshe\n\u2014\"\n\"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than\nthe Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her\nbreed of green shata.\nBossy, opinionated.\nBy the way, Fordie,\" he\nsaid, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off\nhis biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\nAnd he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the\nswivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there\nwas a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for\ninstance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd\ntell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than\nthe average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to\nspeak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as\nmuch as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure\npump regulation.\nHow would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?\nSis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the\nother girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other\nduring the lecture, but not\nmy\nsister! She hung on every word, took\nnotes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser\nreally work in those orientation periods.\n\"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,\n\"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro\nContinent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand\nsquare miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of\ntilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember\nsomething. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an\nedible one. The wild\ndunging\ndrug is harvested there by criminal\nspeculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing\nin recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't\ndunging\ncome only from\nLeif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?\nYou remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the\nisland and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\nThe purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but\nthe boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\nBut Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.\nShe stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while\nI got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture\nof the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the\nopposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out\nwith her.\n\"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\nThe moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was\nin for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's\nlibrary,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But\nyou aren't going to tell me that you read about\ndunging\nin the ship's\nlibrary. The books there have been censored by a government agent of\nEarth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible\nyoung male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran\nAgent\u2014\"\n\"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\nSis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said\ncarefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\"They're not!\"\n\"Not what?\"\n\"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the\ntime and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!\n\"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building\nVenus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like\nVenus.\"\n\"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow\na second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start\ncivilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid\nto make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where\nlaw begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\"You're going to\ntell\n, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is\nspeaking through your mouth!\"\n\"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy\nwho, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless\nentirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a\ngovernment career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after\nI have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look\nforward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been\nfilling your head with all this nonsense?\"\nI was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels\nsomeone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to\nwipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\nA trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers\nwanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of\nthem that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has\nbeen giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering\nmasculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in\ngovernment and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,\nin their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that\nsunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\"Nobody!\nNobody!\n\"\n\"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me\nFord.\"\n\"Ford?\nFord?\nNow, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\nAfter that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few\nmoments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided\nmiserably. Besides, she was a girl.\nAll the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could\nhelp it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to\nhim. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a\nlittle better.\nThe door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was\nwith me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his\nfingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\nHe stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered\nhis blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump\nwhen she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come\nright in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\nSo Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the\ndoor. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or\nexplanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in\nthe control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say\nthat for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed\nsternly.\n\"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in\nclass, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political\ncrime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away\nwithout paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores\nintended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\"\nHe opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.\nThen he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added\ncaustically.\nButt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.\n\"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And\nyou\nwant to foul up\nVenus.\"\n\"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of\npolitics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee\nBrown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over\nher. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What\ndo\nyou have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\"\nHe cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,\n\"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I\ncouldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all\nthe charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the\nEleanor\nRoosevelt\nbecause a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine\nand they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that\nevery passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?\nNot to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.\nI suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him\nequally guilty?\"\n\"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be\nsent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\nHe waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;\nI'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to\nlook for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your\nway to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\nSis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's\nwhat\n? Are\u2014are you daring\nto suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you\nknow it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing\non you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you\nknow how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and\nyour disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen.

Despite being hesitant at first, he decides to break the law anyway because he is technically not a passenger on the ship. Ferdinand is amazed to see the stars, the moon, and another spaceliner take off in space.

Suddenly, the door opens, and a large man plucks him inside by the throat. The man recognizes him as a brother to one of the Anura, which he defines as a herd of women looking for mates. Ferdinand explains his childhood in the Undersea and his parents, to which the other man listens intently. He also mentions that he and his sister have left Earth because she realized there would be no future there. All men have either died in wars, become negatively affected by radioactivity, or gone off to the planets. Then, the older man explains that there are little to no women on Venus, and he had no idea that women were in charge when he first went to Earth to find a wife. He had been arrested and was charged but decided to become a stowaway instead. The man, who introduces himself as Alberta (Butt) Lee Brown, gives Ferdinand the nickname Ford and talks more about his past. Eventually, he asks more about Evelyn, and Ferdinand does not overthink his intentions when he answers. Later, Evelyn then forces Ferdinand to go to a geography lecture with her, where she continuously asks questions and takes notes. However, she does not write down his answer after he corrects the purser and instead takes him back to the cabin to lecture him. They begin to debate, and Ferdinand begins to use the words and knowledge he learned from Butt. Evelyn is suspicious that somebody has been feeding him rebellious opinions, and she begins to hound him for answers after seeing he has a photo of her in his pocket. He then takes Evelyn to see Butt, and she begins to lecture him about breaking the law.

One day, Ferdinand and Evelyn are in a geography lecture, where Ferdinand discusses dunging, a concept that has been censored by Earth's libraries.

He was used to men being the main figures and soon was brought to court, eventually he escaped and hid on this spaceship going back to Venus. He has a dark tan, huge body and long hair. He turns out to be an interesting storyteller and starts caring about the boy. He is also interested in the boy's sister as she fits an image of a good wife - strong, healthy and knowledgeable. He is straightforward and appeals to sense rather than law.

Ferdinand mentions that the crews on the spaceliner ships are always men, as women fulfill the more important tasks of running governments. It is also revealed that only women can become Earth Citizens because of the Male Desuffrage Act, which means that men cannot get an interplanetary passport. In many situations, women have the final say as well. When Butt was arrested on Earth, he could only use a female attorney to communicate his thoughts. Compared to the women, the men on Earth face much more restrictions and must follow what they say at all times. The number of men on Earth has greatly diminished, and the population primarily consists of women. \n\nOn the other hand, Venus is primarily male-inhabited, and there is a scarcity of women there. Butt says that he is unused to the saying \"it's a woman's world\" because women do not run Venus, unlike Earth. He also told his attorney that on Venus, a man could speak freely if he wanted to, and a woman's role is to support him. Men can also make a law whenever they wish with their own guns and that they should not wholly be subservient to the rule of women.

HARNESS\nTwo mighty metal globes clung in a murderous\ndeath-struggle, lashing out with flames of poison.\nYet deep in their twisted, radioactive wreckage\nthe main battle raged\u2014where a girl swayed\nsensuously before her conqueror's mocking eyes.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Summer 1949.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAt first there was only the voice, a monotonous murmur in her ears.\n\"\nDie now\u2014die now\u2014die now\n\u2014\"\nEvelyn Kane awoke, breathing slowly and painfully. The top of the\ncubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a\nrib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of\nknowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.\nFor a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.\n\"\nDie now\u2014die now\u2014die now\n\u2014\"\nThe votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and\nit was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great\nbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this\ntiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain\nher countrymen had either definitely won\u2014or lost.\nThe votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had\nexpected nothing else.\nShe had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would\nset in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,\nand the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless\ngrave of space.\nBut life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon\nimmediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily\nover the memories of her past.\nFor twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched\nThe Defender\ngrow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized\nbattle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian\nglobe,\nThe Invader\n, sprang out of black space to enslave the budding\nTerran Confederacy,\nThe Defender\nwas unfinished, half-equipped, and\nundermanned.\nThe Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.\nThe Defender\n, commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled\nitself from its orbit around Procyon and met\nThe Invader\nwith giant\nfission torpedoes.\nAnd then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic\nCloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men\npoured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken\nDefender\n.\nThe prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal\nand terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the\nScythians nine years to conquer\nThe Defender's\nouter shell. Then had\ncome that final interview with her father.\n\"In half an hour our last space port will be captured,\" he had\ntelepathed curtly. \"Only one more messenger ship can leave\nThe\nDefender\n. Be on it.\"\n\"No. I shall die here.\"\nHis fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. \"Then\ndie usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will\ndestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are\nsuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the\nbattle.\"\n\"There's an off-chance you may survive,\" countered a mentor. \"We're\nalso working on a means for your escape\u2014not only because you are\nGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent\nradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with\nour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.\"\n\"But you must expect to die,\" her father had warned with gentle\nfinality.\nShe clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched\nherself back to the present.\nThat time had come.\nWith some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on\nthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with\nboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo\nfissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the\nship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing\nwould she die.\nShe reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in\ndismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds\nand was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubicle\nhad been terrific.\nWith a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examined\nthe interior of the box.\nIt was a shattered ruin.\nOnce the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathing\nhard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best,\nfinding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during the\ninterval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk that\nclutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.\nShe gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.\nWithin that time she must know whether the prime movers were still\nintact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself,\nset the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were\nunsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian\nenemies.\nStill prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly.\nThe cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on the\nchaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform.\nThen she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun the\nsealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling on\nthe side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly\nto her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve\nof her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring\nthe surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she\nwas alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the\ncubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling\nfrom her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle\nto come would be her apparent harmlessness.\nFour hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born\nScythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that\nof a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black\nstumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had\nsupplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.\nThe corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and\nevidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:\nShould he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two\nmonths since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot.\nYes, he would shoot.\nEvelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously,\nhoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With\nsatisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind\nof the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up\nbehind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first.\nHe had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards,\nhe would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on.\nWomen auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.\nHips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved\nfaster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in\nthe mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He\nwas not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidly\nonward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches,\nthinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yards\nin this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and\nthe dull light in his brain went out.\nShe fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.\nBreathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from\nbehind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man.\nFor I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite\neffective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped\nthe odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam\npower down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While\nhe bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the\nbeam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at\nleast, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of\na woman.\nII\nThe inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.\n\"Name?\"\n\"Evelyn Kane.\"\nThe eyes of the inquisitor widened. \"So you admit to a Terran name.\nWell, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply\nlorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry\ncorporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally,\nwhere is the corporal? Did you kill him?\"\nHe was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have\nthe guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a\nway, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran\nclass. No\u2014he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford\nanother woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with\nthis cool murderess.\n\"Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the\ncorporal?\" He leaned impatiently over his desk.\nThe woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The\nguards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was\ntheir custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.\nShe had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the\ninquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.\n\"If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the\nguards out for a few minutes,\" she said, placing a hand on her hip. \"I\nhave interesting information.\"\nSo that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he\ncould take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the\nguards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one\nanother.\nEvelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib\ngingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He\nwould certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut\nshort with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mind\ngreater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the\nrecorder.\n\"Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,\" she asked\ntersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.\n\"Perat, Viscount of Tharn,\" replied the man mechanically.\n\"What is the extent of his jurisdiction?\"\n\"From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles\nradius.\"\n\"Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for\npassage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.\"\nThe inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a\nseal at its bottom.\n\"You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:\n'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'\"\nThe man's pen scratched away obediently.\nEvelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor.\nShe took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.\n\"Call the guards,\" she ordered.\nHe pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.\n\"This person is no longer a prisoner,\" said the inquisitor woodenly.\n\"She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant of\nZone One.\"\nWhen the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had any\nmemory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, the\nrecording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,\nand sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for\nauditing.\nEvelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended\nfrom the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly\nbe high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a\nsimilar ability in a mere clerk.\nFighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildings\nwere still smoking, and many of the radions high above were either\nshot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor of\nradiation-remover was everywhere.\nShe caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.\n\"What is that?\" she asked the transport attendant.\n\"The Commandant is shooting prisoners,\" he replied laconically.\n\"Oh.\"\n\"Where did you want to go?\"\n\"To the personnel office.\"\n\"That way.\" He pointed to the largest building of the group\u2014two\nstories high, reasonably intact.\nShe walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and there\nwith dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door and\nwas admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyed\nher stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscene\ncoughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.\nA woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whispered\nsomething to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.\nIn the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelyn\nfrowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Under\ncertain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.\nThe next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of some\nsort, who was studying her visa.\n\"I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria\u2014ah\u2014\"\u2014he looked at the visa\nsuspiciously\u2014\"S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to\nS'ria Gerek, here\"\u2014he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back\u2014\"I\nwish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether\nthey want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to\nH.Q.?\"\nShe thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given\nsome answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It\nwould have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in\nhis eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had\ncombed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring\nthe narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided\nyellow hair. He was studying her covertly.\n\"The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,\" she said\nsimply. \"I was told that\nyou\n, that is, I mean\u2014\"\n\"Yes?\" he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate\nloudly into her mechanical transcriber.\nEvelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort,\nmanaged a delicate flush. \"I meant to say, I thought I would be happier\nworking for\u2014working here. So I asked for a transfer.\"\nS'ria Gorph beamed. \"Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet,\nyou know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before we\ncut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well\"\u2014winking\nartfully\u2014\"and I'll see that\u2014\"\nHe stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and\nanxiety. He appeared to listen.\nEvelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was\ncertain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The\nchances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length\nof time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all\npossible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen\npersonal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest in\nthe lowly employees that amused Gorph.\nGorph looked at her uncertainly. \"Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns,\nsends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony.\" He\npointed to a hallway. \"All the way through there, across to the other\nwing.\"\nAs she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and\ncalculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could\nfeel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then that\nthe Faeg had ceased firing.\nHer heart was beating faster as she walked down the hall. She felt a\nvery strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mild\ninterest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officers\nin the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deception\nof Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping he\nwould let her dance for him.\nThe questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breathed\na sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath\nfor long. Perat was merely amused at her \"lie\" to his under-supervisor.\nHe had accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her false\nmemories.\nShe opened the door to the balcony and saw a man leaning moodily on the\nbalustrade. He gave no immediate notice of her presence.\nThe five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn was of uncertain age, as were\nmost of the men of both globes. Only the left side of his face could be\nseen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the corner\nof his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at his\nabdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closely\ncut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings\u2014apparently\nidentical\u2014on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousness\nand unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke an\nunnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomatic\nof a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruel\npleasures.\nIn alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let her\nappraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probe\nwas there awaiting it.\n\"You are right,\" he said coldly, still staring into the court below.\n\"Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.\"\nHe pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. \"Take this.\"\nHe had not as yet looked at her.\nShe crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offered\nher and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearly\ntwenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood.\nOnly one man, a Terran officer of very high rank\u2014was left standing.\nHis arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied the\nkiller above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, their\neyes met, and he started imperceptibly.\nEvelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair was\nwhite, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there could\nbe no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane.\nHer father.\nThe sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a moment\nthat she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream.\nA dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his\neyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and read\nbedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures.\nAn icy, amused voice came through: \"Our orders are to kill all\nprisoners. It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? It\nwarms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.\"\nEven in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her was\nexplaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Because\nall captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his own\nmen, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could not\nrelegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted his\nunderlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol of\nthat contempt. His next words did not surprise her.\n\"It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to kill\nthem. You are shuddering you know?\"\nShe nodded dumbly. Her palm was so wet that a drop of sweat dropped\nfrom it to the floor. She was thinking hard. She could kill the\nCommandant and save her father for a little while. But then the\nproblem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solved\nmore quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On the\ncontrary if she could get him interested in her\u2014\n\"So far as our records indicate,\" murmured Perat, \"the man down there\nis the last living Terran within\nThe Defender\n. It occurred to me that\nour newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. The\nFaeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man's\neyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other\nnights\u2014\"\nThe woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted\nthe ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully,\nwithout expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.\nGordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised\nthe gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed\nthe trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran\nofficer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground,\nface up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead.\nThe man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at first\nwith amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes.\n\"Come here,\" he ordered.\nThe Faeg dropped from her hand.

Her knees were so weak that she\nhad to lean on the coping.\nWith a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hung\nover her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where the\nmentors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had created\nfor her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to be\nthinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scar\ncompletely.\nHe dropped his hand. \"I'm sorry,\" he said with a quiet weariness. \"I\nshouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.\"\nThen: \"Have you ever seen me before?\"\n\"No,\" she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact.\n\"Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Do you have a son?\"\n\"No.\"\nHis mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back,\nsurveying the courtyard and the dead. \"Gorph will be wondering what\nhappened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.\"\nApparently he suspected nothing.\nFather. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon.\nIII\nPerat lay on his couch, sipping cold purple\nterif\nand following the\nthinly-clad dancer with narrowed eyes. Music, soft and subtle, floated\nfrom his communications box, illegally tuned to an officer's club\nsomewhere. Evelyn made the rhythm part of her as she swayed slowly on\ntiptoe.\nFor the last thirty \"nights\"\u2014the hours allotted to rest and sleep\u2014it\nhad been thus. By \"day\" she probed furtively into the minds of the\noffice staff, memorizing area designations, channels for official\nmessages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews.\nBy night she danced for Perat, who never took his eyes from her, nor\nhis probe from her mind. While she danced it was not too difficult to\nelude the probe. There was an odd autohypnosis in dancing that blotted\nout memory and knowledge.\n\"Enough for now,\" he ordered. \"Careful of your rib.\"\nWhen he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that first\nnight, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxed\nfloor, and of falling.\nPerat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her own\ncouch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel\nof metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur\nstereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had been\ninstalled in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of them\nwaited in the dark, breathing rather loudly.\nSuddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light some\ntwo feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, a\nwoman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking through\na luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily.\nEvelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boy\nwere complete strangers.\nBut the woman\u2014!\n\"That is Phaen, my father,\" said Perat quietly. \"He stayed at home\nbecause he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate on\nTharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a general\nresemblance to the Tharn line.\n\"But\u2014\ncan you deny that you are the woman\n?\"\nThe stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark.\n\"There seemed to be some similarity\u2014\" she admitted. Her throat was\nsuddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't know\nthe woman.\nThe table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about the\nroom, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarling\nscowl.\n\"Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scar\nidentical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!\"\nEvelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, but\nher mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlled\nin her plan for destruction. She\nmust\nmake it a known quantity.\n\"Did your father send it to you?\" she asked.\n\"The day before you arrived here. It had been en route for months, of\ncourse.\"\n\"What did he say about it?\"\n\"He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, and\naccept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married and\nthat\u2014well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know about\nthem.\"\n\"Is that all he said?\"\n\"That's all, except that he included this ring.\" He pulled one of the\nduplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her.\n\"It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on my\nmajority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone of\nits kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak,\nbut I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?\"\nEvelyn crossed the room and returned the ring.\n\"Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it?\" murmured Perat.\n\"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we must pass through a sentient\nphase on our way to death. This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the old\ncount was right.\"\n\"You could be courtmartialed for that.\"\n\"Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight\u2014an appeal\nfrom a death sentence.\" He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, and\npoured another glass of\nterif\n. \"Some fool inquisitor can't show\nproper disposition of a woman prisoner.\"\nEvelyn's heart skipped a beat. \"Indeed?\"\n\"The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let him\nalone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then who\ntries for a little extra profit.\"\nShe must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. The\nstimulus would almost certainly make him remember.\n\"I'll wait for you,\" she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out in\na languorous yawn.\n\"Very well.\" Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back at\nher. \"On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, and\nthe others have gone.\"\nBeneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly.\n\"Perhaps you'd better come,\" insisted Perat.\nShe stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly,\nand then followed him out.\nThis might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle of\nperfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually.\n\"Odd smell,\" commented Perat, wrinkling his nose.\n\"Odd scent,\" corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking about\nthe earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully in\nthe use of the \"perfume.\" The adrenalin glands, they had explained,\nprovided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalin\nslowed the heart and digestion, increased the systole and blood\npressure, and increased perspiration to cool the skin. But there\ncould be too much of a good thing. An overdose of adrenalin, they had\npointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidly\nwith the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessed\nover-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightened\npersons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals.\nThe question remained\u2014who would be the more frightened, she or the\ncondemned inquisitor?\nShe was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck was\nstanding stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they entered\nthe Zone Provost's chambers.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "4c274d5afcae4ee3811b6c0986733d3d", "response_text": "Evelyn Kane finds herself in pain in the middle of fighting spaceships.

Generally, they are so alien to us\nthey can't even recognize our existence.\"\nI drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was\nstill an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at\nyourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that\nkind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked\nbefore. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about\neverything else, even your own life.\"\n\"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration\nService, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my\nhazard pay, I get more hard cash than\nyou\ndo, and I'm closer to\nretirement.\"\n\"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,\nwith a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn\nto know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary\ncaution the service likes in officers.\"\n\"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was\na lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got\ntoo cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my\ncontemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an\noutsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more\nthan a figurehead.\"\nWas this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately\ninsulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the\nfamiliarity that had always existed between members of a crew working\nunder close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the\nfirst orbital ships.\n\"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us\nis right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't\ncover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\nI clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling\nme all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your\nexperience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such\nfamiliar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost\nout somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend.\n\"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.\n\"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's\nsolid.\"\nThe landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was\nunimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,\nso it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white\nsand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink\nsunlight.\n\"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul\nas soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\"Apparently, Quade,\nthis\nthing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\nThe keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\nThe wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my\nhead around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\nBut what else can you do with a wail but\nhear\nit?\nQuade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's\ntrace it.\"\n\"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from\nwhat you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You\nmay begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing\ntastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother\nyou.\"\n\"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of\nlanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\nQuade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and\nstaying alive.\"\nThere was no reply.\nHis expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and\nI knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our\npressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\nWe scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our\nhides.\nThe musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting\ntreble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made\nyou feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever\ntasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under\nmy skin.\n\"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your\nwords about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,\nCaptain?\"\n\"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste\nhere.\"\n\"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an\nilliscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't\nfor our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of\nCentauri blushtalk and the like.\"\nIt became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the\nface of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you\nsmell them for the first time.\nQuade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see\nirregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have\ncompensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of\nreference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all\nwe have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes\nbang\nand deflates to a tired joke.\"\nBefore I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of\nspice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip\nbetween the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had\nsize, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp\npain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\nThe new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I\ncouldn't quite make out.\nQuade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think\nyou're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\nHe stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This\nis\nan\nexploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't\nlike the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any\nfurther from the ship.\"\n\"That's important, Captain?\"\n\"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until\nwe got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want\nit to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but\nit would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to\nfree-fall.\"\nBut he turned back.\n\"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want\nto see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational\njamming here.\"\nI took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.\nSweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\nBeside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He\nwas reading the map too.\nThe slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.\nThere was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had\nknown for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough\nto get used to it.\"\nHe said nothing on the route back to the spacer.\n\"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said\nexpansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,\nBruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\nMy finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.\nI was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a\npressure suit.\n\"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?\nTransphasia?\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our\ncurrent psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\nI collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,\nlet's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\"No, thanks. I was wondering why\nyou\ndid.\"\n\"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed\nme home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own\nmaster is the most content.\"\n\"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and\nstill be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd\nhave anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\"\nI\nhad no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the\nreins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They\nwill soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick\nyou themselves.\"\n\"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\nHe blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many\nyears. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the\nincrease in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.\nI'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select\ntheir own leader?\"\nNagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy\ntest lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what\nto do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what\nthey are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\nI leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell\nyou\na thing,\nNagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no\nlonger a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less\nhuman nature. Even I know that much!\"\nHe was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is\nobey\nme or, by\nJupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal\nback home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to\nthink of me\u2014of\nus\n, the officers, as their leaders. As far as the\ncrew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this\nship.\"\n\"He\nis\na good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his\nstatus.\"\nThe dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for\ngetting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head\nand stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's\npermission....\"\n\"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any\nreliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact\nwith the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,\nbut the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\"How far can we run it back?\"\nQuade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\"How many?\"\n\"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,\nsmell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change\nsites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you\nknow.\"\n\"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from\ntransphasia. Is that it?\"\nQuade gave a curt nod.\n\"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\"\nSergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping\nout the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the\nsuited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray\nprojectors.\n\"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and\nshook his head disapprovingly.\n\"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can\ntake apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we\ncomplete the survey.\"\n\"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of\nwhat it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a\nspaceship.\"\n\"Not,\" he persisted, \"if\ntoo\nmany parts are missing.\"\n\"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,\nwhy don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\nNagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned\ncautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,\nand this isn't the way.\"\n\"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men\nhave to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender\ncable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of\ntheir own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em\ntake a part of that environment with them.\"\n\"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,\nyou are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in\ngambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take\nstupid\nchances. I\nmight\nbe doing the wrong thing, but I can see you\nwould\nbe doing it wrong.\"\n\"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust\nus\n.\"\n\"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you\nlazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I\nknow it\nhas\nto be wrong.\"\nI turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and\na cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a\nteam to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he\nintended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what\nI said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody\nelse would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most\nexperienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a\nleash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\"\nFor me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had\nto think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for\nme. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw\nand ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a\nman, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\nNo one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange\nplanet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see\nthat space exploration\nmade\na man a reckless fool by doing things on\none planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\nThe thought intruded itself:\nwhy\nhadn't I recognized this before I\nlet Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted\nhim dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and\nrecognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\nI threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very\nwell be true, but how did that help now?\nI had to\nthink\n.\nI was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane\nreasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,\nthere were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have\nendless opinions to contend with.\nBut it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.\nThere was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to\nreach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten\nmiles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in\nspacesuits.\nBut how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\nWhy was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he\nwould be?\nHow could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable?\n\"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.\nHe patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained\nenvironment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the\nback of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed\nyou your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If\ntransphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're\nair-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent\nthat hide. You got it made.\"\n\"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these\nair-fast joints.\"\n\"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any\nspaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014\nsound\n. These suits\nperfectly soundproof?\"\n\"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets\ntogether and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to\nblock out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature\nspaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the\nsound.\"\n\"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to\nfind one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know\nwhat he will hear; what's worrying me is\nhow\nhe'll hear it, in what\nsensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his\nonly chance.\"\n\"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I\nsuppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\nFarley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\"That would do it.\"\n\"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\"\nI shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic\nfeedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with\nluck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a\nharmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it.\nFigaro\nand\nAsleep in the Cradle of the Deep\ncan compensate for high-pitched\noutside temperatures, and\nFlight of the Bumble Bee\nto block bass\nnotes.\"\nFarley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\nFarley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that\nI\nshould be running\nshort on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,\nFarley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we\nhave left?\"\nThe quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more\nabout half full.\"\n\"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some\nleft\n? We'll\ntake this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get\nsome light wine....\"\n\"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\"Ration it to the men!\"\n\"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in\nthe middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block\nout sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service\nhasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't\nlike to think how they would taste.\"\n\"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink\nalmond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that\nwine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up\nsensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are\ngoing.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of\nwine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,\nand then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\nI turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.\nI'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\"\n\"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just\nbeyond that rocky ridge.\"\nThe landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate\nsyrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,\nmellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across\nthe dark, rich taste of the planet.\nI splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth\nto sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made\nthe landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\nThe four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more\nof our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were\ncabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even\nso, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\nWe stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky\njob crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful\nfor the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the\ntape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt\nsomething dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.\n\"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on\nthis channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain.\nYou\nweren't giggling,\nsir?\"\n\"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\nA moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my\nshelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\nThe basso profundo performing\nFigaro\non my headset climbed to a\ngirlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had\nfirst heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a\nlong\ntime. Look again.\"\n\"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\nI took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It\nwas\nQuade. A\nman in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead.\nGrudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.\nA hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed\non sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of\nPomp and\nCircumstance\n.\nFarley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\nThe Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better\nget him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing\nbefore with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming\nwind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for\nthe cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\"\nThe four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints\nin our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured\nman walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate\nadjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too\nmuch for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\nAt first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with\nonly a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now\nshowing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it\nlooked good to me, like home.\nThe wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\nI realized that I was actually\nhearing\nit for the first time.\nThe alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied\nlizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver\ntail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be\ndangerous.\"\nQuade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be\nhostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\nQuade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged\ntoward the herd.\n\"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\nI couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At\nthe time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\nAs we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except\nfor the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made\na grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of\nhis tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\nThe men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them\nto him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck\nme violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile\nsoil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of\nthe beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the\nstiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us\nget past their circle.\"\nIt was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a\nbouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\nI followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\nThe bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an\neighty-degree angle.\nI was stone sober.\nThe others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or\ntaking cover.\nThe ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer\nsat on his haunches and waited for us to move.\n\"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\nHe punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I\nthink of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far\nhave you got in the tractors?\"\n\"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the\nspaceship where they belong. We\nshouldn't\nrisk losing them and\ngetting stuck here.\"\n\"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to\nmeet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and\ntastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.\nOut there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien\nlanguages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.\nUsing the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as\neasily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced\nspacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry.

In my condition\u2014with\na broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014I\nshouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\nfrom\nBelshazzar's\nCCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\nport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\nrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\nand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\nhere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\nI flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\nIt was almost five minutes before the \"acknowledge\" came through from\nthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\nswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\nhaggard look.\n\"Granthan!\" he burst out. \"Where are the others? What happened out\nthere?\" I turned him down to a mutter.\n\"Hold on,\" I said. \"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\" I didn't wait for\nan answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\n\"\nBelshazzar\nwas sabotaged. So was\nGilgamesh\n\u2014I think. I got out. I\nlost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\nMed people the drinks are on me.\"\nI finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\nscreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\nas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\nget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.\nKayle was talking.\n\"\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\nthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\"\n\"How the hell do I know?\" I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\ndroning on:\n\"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\nhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\npossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\ntold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to on\nthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\n\"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\nwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\npossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\nknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\npass the patrol line.\n\"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\nthe risk.\"\n\"What do I do now?\" I stormed. \"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\nyou think of something? I need a doctor!\"\nPresently Kayle replied. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You'll have to enter a\nparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\nit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\" He didn't meet my\neye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\nknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\nwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\npretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'd\nbeen condemned to death.\nII\nI tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\nwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\nconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\nrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\nmy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\nwas acting under Gool orders.\nI wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\npsychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\nearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\nmine, all mine....\nBut how could I be sure of that?\nMaybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\nskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\ntheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.\nBut this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\nlike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\nwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\nmind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\nNow was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\nresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see again\nwhat had happened.\nI lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\nthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\nSense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\nfirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\nsurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\ntheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\nthrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\nmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\nThe immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\nme. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\npersonality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\ncontinuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\nAnd found it.\nAs the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\nof static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\nprobing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\nmotivations.\nI focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\n\"\nIt is a contact, Effulgent One!\n\"\n\"\nSoftly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the\nthreshold....\n\"\n\"\nIt is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating\ntrough!\n\"\nA part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the\nvoices\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\nintricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\nconcretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\nagainst the intruding stimuli\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\nof the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\ncenters, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\ncontrol compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\nthe way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\u2014and then the\nhatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\nMy blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\nthe lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\u2014and the\nworld-ending impact as I fell.\nAt a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\nlashed out again\u2014fighting the invader.\n\"\nAlmost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!\n\"\n\"\nImpossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend\nthe last filament of your life-force!\n\"\nFree from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\nare instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\nfollowed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\nmy subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\npassage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\u2014at a conscious level.\nWatching the Gool mind, I learned.\nThe insinuating probe\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\ntheorized\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\nBut a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\nbeen done to me.\nHesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\nand manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\ncrystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\nthemselves.\nAbruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\nto pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\nvoid\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\nglistening dark shape.\nThere was a soundless shriek. \"\nEffulgence! It reached out\u2014touched\nme!\n\"\nUsing the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,\nstifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the\nobscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy\nof xenophobia\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\nI clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.\nNot pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,\ntracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\nI saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There\nwas a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner\nsource, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its\nrim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a\nmore favorable position.\nI probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that\nlinked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced\nthe passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where\nsmaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory\ntold me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that\nwould transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had\ndiscovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur\nalone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\u2014riches\nbeyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe\ncluster\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\u2014at a single feeding\ntrough. They would spread out across a galaxy\u2014and beyond.\nBut not if I could help it.\nThe Gool had evolved a plan\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\nIn the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among\nthe fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,\nperhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a\nman back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\nThen they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter\nof the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a\npsychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened\nthe fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see\nwhat I could steal.\nA timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and\nwhite sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,\nfared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the\nconcepts of an alien mind.\nI paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within\npattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\nI followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its\nmeaning exploded in my mind.\nFrom the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in\nits lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of\ntheir kind.\nMatter across space.\n\"You've got to listen to me, Kayle,\" I shouted. \"I know you think I'm\na Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without\na fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The\nconcept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take\nmy word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus\nan infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\u2014and a few other\nthings....\"\nI harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was\ngetting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\nscreens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\nKayle came back\u2014and his answer boiled down to \"no.\"\nI tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\nfor the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\ncross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\nto the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\ntalked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\nego-complex.\nI might have saved my breath.\n\"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped.\n\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\nyou well enough. I'm sorry.\"\nI leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\nthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\nproblem at hand.\nI keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\nreference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\nstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\nthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\ndaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\nAnd I had a few ideas.\nIII\nThe shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\nwild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\nit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\n\"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\npreparatory to picking up approach orbit....\"\nThe screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\nautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\nwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\nI closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\nme\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\nmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\nstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\nkeys, spoke into his microphone:\n\"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\nseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\nI blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\nbelated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\nnow, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\n\"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am\npicking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"\nThere was a long pause. Then:\n\"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\ncountermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\nninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\"\nIt hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\nof defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\ndumb, and hope for a little luck.\n\"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\nfellows. I'm a little banged up\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.\nWhat was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\"\n\"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\"\n\"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I\nchecked in with DEW\u2014\"\nIt was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the\ncontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014\nA radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\nfrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\nscreens blanked off....\nFor an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\nattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\nsoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\nover, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\nI hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\ndisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\nlifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\nthe water.\nI would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\nposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I was\nbadly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\n\"This is Z four-oh-two,\" I said. \"I have an urgent report for Colonel\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\"\nKayle's face appeared. \"Don't fight it, Granthan,\" he croaked. \"You\npenetrated the planetary defenses\u2014God knows how. I\u2014\"\n\"Later,\" I snapped. \"How about calling off your dogs now? And send\nsomebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other\ncomplaints.\"\n\"We have you pinpointed,\" Kayle cut in. \"It's no use fighting it,\nGranthan.\"\nI felt cold sweat pop out on my forehead. \"You've got to listen,\nKayle,\" I shouted. \"I suppose you've got missiles on the way already.\nCall them back! I have information that can win the war\u2014\"\n\"I'm sorry, Granthan,\" Kayle said. \"It's too late\u2014even if I could\ntake the chance you were right.\"\nA different face appeared on the screen.\n\"Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, and\nin the name of the President\u2014who has been apprised of this tragic\nsituation\u2014it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awarded\nthe Congressional Medal of Honor\u2014posthumously\u2014for your heroic effort.\nAlthough you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will,\nto carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detracts\nfrom your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.\"\nThe general's arm went up in a rigid gesture.\n\"Stow that, you pompous idiot!\" I barked. \"I'm no spy!\"\nKayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general.\n\"Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....\"\nI flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with\neach heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.\nThe missiles would be from Canaveral.\nI closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....\nI sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the\ncities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked\nthrough the cluster of minds.\n\"\u2014\nmissile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.\n\"\nI fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.\nHe turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam\nhis hand against the destruct button.\nMen fell on him, dragged him back. \"\u2014\nfool, why did you blow it?\n\"\nI dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,\ndetonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.\nI would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.\nI was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I\nstarted it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the\nglint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on\nthe horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the\npilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next\nattacker.\nIV\nIt was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling\nwalk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.\nA few more\nminutes and you can lie down ... rest....\nThe shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker\nsquare. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside\nfor a grip with my good hand.\nGravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped\nalong the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.\nI ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a\nconfused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the\ncity all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep\u2014\nI heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a\ngout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between\nthe cars. I caught the clear thought:\n\"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right\u2014\"\nI reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went\nout, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled\nsteer.\nIt was easy\u2014if I could only stay awake.\nI gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark\ncorner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality\nfraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn\nme of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide\ndown into darkness.\nThe car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow\nsunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss\ncreaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation\nat the treatment it had received\u2014walking brace and all\u2014and the burned\narm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping\nit from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a\nbadly embalmed mummy\u2014except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not\nto fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off\nKey Largo, but things had been happening too fast.\nI had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced\ninto rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If\nthe gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would\nhave finished me\u2014and the hapless fisherman\u2014right then. We rode out a\ncouple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the\nair.\nAt a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car\u2014with driver. He dropped\nme at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town\nfor groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.\nNow I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of\nthe farce.\nI pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then\nrigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as\ninconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.\nI needed new clothes\u2014or at least different ones\u2014and something to\ncover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had\nrecognized me at a glance.\nI lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly\nworried\u2014at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone\nhe'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.\nThe click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to\nthe door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low\nbuildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes\nand let my awareness stretch out.\n\"\u2014\nlousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in\nthe hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey....\n\"\nI settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw\nthrough his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the\nlistless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of\nthe platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph\nwindow, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.\nI walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped\ncounter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet\npatches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.\nMy host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped\nsandwiches under a glass cover. \"I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and\ncigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.\"\n\"Better git out there and look after yer train,\" the girl said\ncarelessly. \"When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?\"\n\"Put it in a bag. Quick.\"\n\"Look who's getting bossy\u2014\"\nMy host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing\nfood in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. \"You git back\naround that counter!\"\nShe filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.\n\"That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.\"\nMy host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them\non the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it\nup and started out.\n\"Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?\"\nThe trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the\nloose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag\ninside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy\nrailroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl\nwatched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train\nstarted up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard\nhim say: \"Friend o' mine in there\u2014just passin' through.\"\nI was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over\nevery move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would\nrationalize his behavior, fill in the details\u2014and never know that the\noriginal idea hadn't been his own.\nI drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay\nback. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked \"U. S. Naval\nAerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon\". With any luck I'd reach New\nOrleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a\nraid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could\nwait.\nIt was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding\nin the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling\ngood, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles\nin me. I had my supplies\u2014a few candy bars and some cigarettes\u2014stuffed\nin the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was\nunencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right\nleg and the sling binding my arm.\nI picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,\nstarted limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It\nwas already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.\nThrough the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various\nwounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking\nabout shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with\nblack hair. \"Want a lift?\" he called.\nI thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his\nbudding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow\nhis thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of\ncommunications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.\nAn hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing\ndistrict of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with\nthe dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.\nTwenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a\npinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin\ntailor\u2014maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was\nan unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of\ndistinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.\nThe man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured\nI'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a\nfisherman\u2014I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house\nderelict.\nI walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy\nvegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of\nbrontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with\na wart.\n\"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\"\nHe rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.\n\"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\"\n\"I'm a tourist,\" I said. \"They told me before I left home not to miss\nit.\"\nHe grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his\nflag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without\nlooking.\n\"How far is it?\" I asked him.\n\"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\"\n\"Pretty big place, I guess.\"\nHe didn't answer.\nWe went through a warehousing district, swung left along the\nwaterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot\ncyclone fence with a locked gate.\n\"A buck ten,\" my driver said.\nI looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low\nbuildings. \"What's this?\"\n\"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\"\nI touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.\nHe blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an\nopen gate with a blue-uniformed guard.

Granthan relays how he got out. Kayle thinks that Granthan may be under the control of the Gool, and he may be the one who inadvertently caused the destruction of the ship. Kayle orders Granthan to stay in Orbit around Earth. Granthan knows that if he stays in orbit, there is sure to be a fleet of missiles on their way towards him.

Granthan awakes on a lifeboat, in immense pain and terrible condition. He presumably came in contact with the Gool and ended up alive, though scathed. However, he has no recollection of what happened or how he managed to escape on the lifeboat. Granthan decides to call TSA headquarters, informing Col. Kayle that he is alive. Kayle is skeptical, aware of the Gool's ability to mind control, and believes that Granthan has been brainwashed due to his inability to recall the events. Kayle decides that he cannot risk a potentially sabotaged Granthan returning to Earth, and Granthan realizes that he is going to be executed. Urgently in need of a solution, Granthan remembers his training before the mission, how he had learned how to access his subconscious to obtain memories. He decides to do so, going back and seeing his mind being probed by the Gool and controlling his actions. Upon seeing how the Gool had taken control of his mind, Granthan realizes that he, too, can replicate the practice, and he probes the mind of a Gool. When he probes the Gool, he finds that they plan to take over the galaxy through matter transmission. Granthan calls Kayle again, explaining what he has seen and begging for him to change his mind. However, Kayle still refuses to let Granthan return. Granthan then decides to take matters into his own hands, using his mind control techniques to make officers allow him through and shut off radar detection. As Granthan lands on the ocean's surface, he calls Kayle again in an effort to convince him. Instead, Kayle tells him it's too late, and General Titus appears through transmission to salute him before his execution. At the last second, though, Granthan uses his mind control on the man controlling the missiles, and detonates them, buying him time to take the escape capsule to shore. Granthan eventually ends up at a trainyard, fending off an attacker before sneaking onto a train car.

And the story begins with Granthan in some kind of dream where he is badly burned and really hurt, except, this was not simply a dream. He wakes up realizing that his right leg is broken, his skull is probably fractured, and his left arm was badly burned. Surprisingly, those injuries have been taken care of. There is a walking brace on his leg, stiches on his head, arm is wrapped to the shoulder; to add onto that, he somehow got himself onto a lifeboat. Granthan has no idea how he might be capable of doing any of those given his conditions. \n\nHe quickly contacted Kayle and told him about the disaster, but Kayle is suspicious of the reasons that he is the only survivor. The Gool is known to have telehypnotic abilities that can control men without them being aware of it, thus Granthan\u2019s blackout during the attack seems to be fitting. Kayle refuses to land Granthan on Earth. Granthan decides to figure out what actually happened to him during the blackout. Since he is a psychodynamicist, he can gather the memories of his subconscious and see what has occurred. Going multiple levels deeper within the memory, he finally finds the Gool. He watches the Gool take over his body and his mind, he sees how the Gool managed to get him onto the lifeboat, and he sees how the Gool is able to withdraw from the mind, leaving no marks behind. Then, he learns the way that the Gool controls the mind, which allows him to acknowledge the plan that the Gool has \u2013 to spread out across the galaxy and beyond. Finally, he learns their secret, matter transmission.\n\nAfter grasping the idea of sending matter across space, Granthan tells Kayle that he can build it. Kayle rejects the idea despite Granthan\u2019s effort to explain his training on encephaloscope. Granthan then uses the Gool\u2019s ability that he has just gained to pass the outer defense line, to disappear off the radar, and to avoid the missiles, etc. He is able to get to a train for some sleep, and later he gets off near the New Orleans, where he changed his clothes and goes to Delta National Laboratories.

There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\nHis steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\nSome of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\nLeaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided\nthe murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and\nplanted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all\nMartians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the\nMartian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin\nthat staggered and all but dropped him.\nThe Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered back\nand sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But he\nwas not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight for\nDennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis took\nit, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride over\nwith all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw and\nspun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowly\nsagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor.\nDennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the international\npolice arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life. Upon search,\nthe police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under his\nleft arm-pit\u2014an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout the\ninterplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates still\nwithout the law were known to possess them.\n\"Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck,\nBrooke!\" The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. \"If\nI'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew.\nWho else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and have\nin his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete records\non that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps they\nhave details on this dandy!\" He eyed admiringly the priceless Martian\nembroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border of\nred, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black\nacerine\non his finger.\nDennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put to\nshame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile curved\nhis generous mouth. \"I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture of\nKoerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again\u2014you don't know\nBertram! To him an infraction of rules is a major crime. Damn Venus!\"\nHe reached for his glass of\nVerbena\nbut the table had turned over\nduring the struggle, and the glass was a shattered mass of gleaming\nBacca-glas\nshards. He laughed shortly as he became conscious of the\nvenomous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of the excited voices of the\nguests and the emphatic disapproval of the Venusian proprietor who\nwas shocked at having a brawl in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive\nPalace.\n\"Better come to Headquarters with me, Dennis,\" the lieutenant said\ngently. \"We'll say you captured him, and if he's Koerber's, the\ncredit's yours. A trip to Terra's what you need, Venus for you is a\nhoodoo!\"\nThe stern, white haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminil\ndesk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six foot\nfour frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as\nif uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a\ndecision, he were forcing himself to speak:\n\"Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for\ntwo reasons. The first one you already know\u2014your capture of one of\nKoerber's henchmen\u2014has given us a line as to his present orbit of\npiracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's not\nreally why I've brought you here.\" He frowned again as if what he had\nto say were difficult indeed.\n\"Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her\u2014a\ndelicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, and\nvery clever young lady could perform. And,\" he paused, grimacing,\n\"somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringing\nher and several other passengers, began to send distress signals.\nFinally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three days\noverdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untold\nmillions, the spacer itself\u2014seem to have vanished.\"\nDennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazel\neyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slits\nthat smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides,\nwhile something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruel\nprecision.\n\"Marla!\" He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the power\nof Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like an\natom-blast.\n\"Commander,\" Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths of\nemotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself\u2014and\nthat grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another known\nevery change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul.\n\"Commander, give me one ...\none\nchance at that spawn of unthinkable\nbegetting! Let me try, and I promise you ...\" in his torture, Dennis\nwas unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surface\nof the priceless desk, \"I promise you that I will either bring you\nKoerber, or forfeit my life!\"\nCommander Bertram nodded his head. \"I brought you here for that\npurpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, where\nthe last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!\"\nHe reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast set\non his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. \"You'll now see\na visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that left\nVenus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vessel\nin space. This, Dennis,\" the Commander emphasized his words, \"is your\nchance to redeem yourself!\" He fell silent, while the viso-screen began\nto show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacer\nup-tilted in its cradle.\nThey watched the parabola it made in its trajectory as it flashed into\nspace and then fell into orbit there beyond the planetary attraction of\nVenus. On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real.\nA flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on\nthe viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud\ninterplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void,\nand suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved\nas if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining\naltitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic\ncourse, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's\nside.\nTiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in\nactuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it\nwas an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with\ndeadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of\nthe barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank.\nCommander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose\nfeatures were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor\nand the burning fire in his eyes.\n\"And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach\nTerra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other\ntransports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes\nthey're never seen again.\"\n\"When do I leave, Commander!\" Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin\nof ice.\n\"Right now, if you wish. We have a new cruiser armored in beryloid with\ndouble hull\u2014a new design against Genton shells, but it's the speed\nof the thing that you'll want to know about. It just about surpasses\nanything ever invented. Get the figures and data from the coordination\nroom, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.\" He\nextended his hand. \"You're the best spacer we have\u2014aside from your\nrecklessness\u2014and on your success depends far more than the capture of\nan outlaw.\" Bertram smiled thinly. \"Happy landing!\"\nII\nTheir nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a\nphantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally\nelusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of\nfathomless space.\nTo all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first\nassignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the\ninner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance\nagainst stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even\ntheir cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked\nthe luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol\nspacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was\nhoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a\nthing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the\ncomfortable luxury that they knew.\nDay after day they went through their drills, donning space suits,\nmanning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and\neternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast.\nAnd suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search\nas a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the\nviso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to\nlife. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured\nthe space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the\nviso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and\nbecoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport.\nPresently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke\ncommanded through the teleradio from the control room:\n\"Prepare to board!\"\nEvery member of the crew wanted to be among the boarding party, for\nall but George Randall, the junior member of the crew had served his\napprenticeship among the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra. He felt\nnauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of\nspace. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale\nwhen the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who\nwere to go beside himself:\n\"You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!\"\n\"Yes, Captain!\" Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in\nhis basso-profundo voice.\n\"You and I'll take a second emergency!\" There was a pause in the voice\nof the Captain from the control room, then: \"Test space suits. Test\noxygen helmets! Atom-blasts only, ready in five minutes!\"\nGeorge Randall breathed a sigh of relief. He watched them bridge the\nspace to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a\nproud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he\nturned away with a look of shame.\nInside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed\nsurvey.\n\"No doubt about it,\" he spoke through the radio in his helmet. \"Cargo\nmissing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were\nout of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been\nfired by Koerber!\" He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly\nhe seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced.\nSomehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed,\nwhere life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great\nresolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him.\nDennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in\nthinking of her and all he had lost. When he finally spoke, his voice\nwas harsh, laconic:\n\"Prepare to return!\"\nScotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a\nmajor battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter,\nshifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and\ngazed curiously at Captain Brooke. They all knew the story in various\nversions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit\nin their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.\nTom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow,\neasygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the\nswiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of\nmen toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third\nlieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed\nby Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself. All left in silence, as\nif the tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched\nthem intimately.\nAboard the I.S.P. Cruiser, a surprise awaited them. It was young George\nRandall, whose excited face met them as soon as they had entered the\nairlocks and removed the space suits.\n\"Captain Brooke ... Captain, recordings are showing on the new 'Jet\nAnalyzers' must be the trail of some spacer. Can't be far!\" He was\nfairly dancing in his excitement, as if the marvelous work of the\nnew invention that detected the disturbance of atomic jets at great\ndistance were his own achievement.\nDennis Brooke smiled. His own heart was hammering, and inwardly he\nprayed that it were Koerber. It had to be! No interplanetary passenger\nspacer could possibly be out here at the intersection of angles Kp\n39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. None\nbut a pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could dare! This was the\ndangerous asteroid belt, where even planetoids drifted in eccentric\nuncharted orbits.\nDennis, Tom Jeffery and Scotty Byrnes raced to the control room,\nfollowed by the ponderous Dallas to whom hurry in any form was\nanathema. There could be no doubt now! The \"Jet Analyzer\" recorded\npowerful disturbance, atomic\u2014could be nothing else.\nInstantly Captain Brooke was at the inter-communication speaker:\n\"Crew, battle stations! Engine room, full speed!\"\nScotty Byrnes was already dashing to the engine room, where his beloved\nmotors purred with an ascending hum. Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser each\nmember of the crew raced to his assigned task without delay. Action\nimpended, and after days and nights of inertia, it was a blessed\nrelief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces, and the banter of men\nsuddenly galvanized by a powerful incentive was bandied back and forth.\nAll but George Randall. Now that action was imminent. Something gripped\nhis throat until he could hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S.P.\nuniform. A growing nausea gripped his bowels, and although he strove to\nkeep calm, his hands trembled beyond control.\nIn the compact, super-armored control room, Captain Brooke watched\nthe telecast's viso-screen, with hungry eyes that were golden with\nanticipation. It seemed to him as if an eternity passed before at\nlast, a black speck danced on the illuminated screen, until it finally\nreached the center of the viso-screen and remained there. It grew by\nleaps and bounds as the terrific speed of the cruiser minimized the\ndistance long before the quarry was aware of pursuit.\nBut at last, when the enemy cruiser showed on the viso-screen,\nunmistakably for what it was\u2014a pirate craft, it showed by its sudden\nmaneuver that it had detected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had described\na parabola in space and headed for the dangerous asteroid belt. As if\nnavigated by a masterly hand that knew each and every orbit of the\nasteroids, it plunged directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to lose\nthe I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneuver. Ordinarily, it would have\nsucceeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such\na trap without specific orders. But to Dennis Brooke, directing the\nchase from the control room, even certain death was welcome, if only he\ncould take Koerber with him.\nWeaving through the deadly belt for several hours, Dennis saw his\nquarry slow down. Instantly he seized the chance and ordered a salvo\nfrom starboard. Koerber's powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up\nspewing Genton-shells. The battle was on at last.\nFrom the banked atom-cannon of the I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain\nof atomic fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged rent back toward\nmidship showed on Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if it had been\nmortally wounded. Then Dennis maneuvered his cruiser into a power\ndive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the space lane above him, but as\nhe came up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was\nripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under\nthe detonating impact.\nIt was then that Dennis Brooke saw the immense dark shadow looming\nimmediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom\ndesperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass,\nbut too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no\navail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was\ndoomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful\nmagnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser.\nWith a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennis\nmaneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he\nsank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the\nmaneuver avoided it.\n\"George Randall!\" He shouted desperately into the speaker. \"Cut all\njets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed\nout of the increasing gravity trap.\n\"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the\njets!\" But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then\nKoerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught,\nforced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of\na whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that\nshook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.\nBeneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to\nmeet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy.\nIt showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active.\nGravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this\nunknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time\nwas supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could\npossibly explain the incredible gravity.\nAnd then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to\nRandall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes\nhimself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action,\ntoo late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent\na crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding\nthem in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.\nIII\nThe atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided\na man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser,\nthe strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them,\nwas anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against\nthe sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in\nthe cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could\nreach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.\n\"Pretty much of a mess!\" Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he\nturned to Scotty Byrnes. \"What's your opinion? Think we can patch her\nup, or are we stuck here indefinitely?\"\nScotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into\nthe forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower\npetals. The crash-landing had not helped either.\n\"Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain,\nbut,\" he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.\n\"But what? Speak up man!\" It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his\nordinarily gentle voice like a lash.\n\"But, you may as well know it,\" Scotty replied quietly. \"That parting\nshot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use the\nemergency tank to make it down here!\"\nFor a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. Dennis\nBrooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tom\ntugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed\nmournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long,\nragged line of cliffs.\n\"I think we got Koerber, though,\" he said at last. \"While Tom was doing\na job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast\nand out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!\"\n\"To hell with Koerber!\" Tom Jeffery exploded. \"You mean we're stuck in\nthis hellish rock-pile?\"\n\"Easy, Tom!\" Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale,\nimpassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. \"Where's Randall?\"\n\"Probably hiding his head under a bunk!\" Dallas laughed with scorn. His\ncontemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who\nfailed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place\nin the I.S.P.\n\"Considering the gravity of this planetoid,\" Dennis Brooke said\nthoughtfully, \"it's going to take some blast to get us off!\"\n\"Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for\nour atom-busters to chew on!\" Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal\noptimist.\n\"Better break out those repair plates,\" Dennis said to Scotty. \"Tom,\nyou get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log\nbook, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try\nto find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,\" he said in a\nlow voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.\nA figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear\nthe last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead\nbumped during the crash landing.\n\"Captain ... I ... I wanted ...\" he paused unable to continue.\n\"You wanted what?\" Captain Brooke's voice was terse. \"Perhaps you\nwanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?\"\n\"Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding\njob....\" That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the\nwords had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His\ncandid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage\nwith its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened\nthe anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized\nthis was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better\nmen than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there had\nbeen an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in\nthe grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung\nhis neck!\n\"Certainly, Randall,\" he replied in a much more kindly tone. \"We'll\nneed all hands now.\"\n\"Thank you, sir!\" Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his\nmouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon\nhim, he whirled and re-entered the ship.\n\"But for him we wouldn't be here!\" Dallas exclaimed. \"Aagh!\" He shook\nhis head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chin\nshook like gelatin. \"Cowards are hell!\" He spat.\n\"Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance.\" Dennis observed.\n\"You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake in\nthis than we, and he's spoiled it for you!\"\n\"Yep,\" Dennis nodded. \"But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feuds\non my ship. Get it!\" The last two words cut like a scimitar.\nDallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spat\na thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground. One by one they\nre-entered the cruiser.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "87a2a5c010e14561a3d5059e118027f3", "response_text": "Dennis Brooke was drinking and watching a dancer along with rereading the last letter of Marla, his fiancee, who accepted a new assignment and left him.

One night at the chamber, Dennis is suddenly attacked by a strange Martian man, who he fights off and defeats. The police later discover that the Martian man was in possession of a forbidden weapon, inferring that he is part of Koerber's crew. Dennis then meets the I.S.P Commander in his office, where he is informed that a ship, the ship that was supposed to take Marla to Terra, has vanished, and all signs point to Koerber. The Commander gives Dennis a final chance to redeem himself and defeat Koerber for good, equipping him with a crew and an upgraded cruiser that can travel at record speed. Aboard the cruiser, Dennis eventually finds the vanished ship, but unfortunately no hopeful signs of survival from the destruction. Heartbroken by the loss of Marla, Dennis advises his crew to return back, when they notice Koerber's ship approaching. Dennis challenges the ship to a battle, sending cannons and jets to crash into the ship. However, Koerber's ship is quickly approaching the surface of a planet, and Koerber sends a magnetic beam to bring Dennis' cruiser down with him. Dennis panics and orders George Randall, the youngest on the crew, to cut the jets and use magentic repulsion, but Randall does not respond. Another crew member eventually cuts the jets, but not early enough, and the cruiser is stranded on the unknown planet. The crew brainstorms how they can repair the ship and get off the planet, blaming Randall; Dennis scolds the crew for being harsh on Randall as they get to work."}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "857440f4a1d74ff0b96fa9cc5d4554a8", "response_text": "Dennis Brooke cannot stop reading the final letter he receives from his fiancee Marla Starland. He is at the Jovian Chamber in the Inter-planetary Palace on Venus, where it is highly regarded as an elusive place that costs a fortune to enter. He drinks and makes eye contact with a young martian, who stares at him back with hatred. A Mercurian dancer flings herself onto his lap, and the Martian leaps up to attack him while the other guests are distracted. Dennis manages to knock the Martian, and the international police find out that the Martian is a member of Bren Koerber\u2019s pirate crew. The Police Lieutenant Gillian mentions that they should radio the I.S.P., but Dennis reveals that he is grounded from the organization. The lieutenant still insists that he come to Terra with him. Later, the I.S.P. commander frowns when he sees Dennis walk into the office. He explains that they brought him here for two reasons. The first reason is tracking down Koerber\u2019s orbit of piracy by capturing one of his henchmen. The second reason is about the disappearance of Marla and the loss of contact with the interplanetary spacer that she was on. In his despair, Dennis begs the commander for one more opportunity to bring back Koerber or die trying. He then sees a visual record of the passenger spacer. They later embark on the trip, and the spacer they are in gets attacked by atom shells. The commander tells Dennis that he can use the new cruiser equipped to deal with these dangers. His expedition is the first assignment for many of the crew members. As they are about to give up, the cruiser finds what is left of a passenger cruiser. Everybody wants to be a part of the boarding party except for George Randall because he still feels nauseous about the idea. Tom, Scotty, and Dallas are chosen to go with Dennis. Dennis finishes creating the survey about the liners left, and they leave. Randall tells them that another spacer is somewhere close behind them, and Dennis hopes it is Koerber. He observes Koerber\u2019s cruiser through the viso-screen, but it suddenly maneuvers once it realizes that the I.S.P. cruiser is nearby too. Although it tries to lose Dennis and his crew, Koerber\u2019s cruiser is unsuccessful, and the two cruisers begin fighting. He sees the shadow behind Koerber\u2019s ship and avoids getting hit by a beam that the enemy cruiser fires. Randall is given orders to cut the engines, but he does not follow them. The cruiser is forced to land in the middle of nowhere of unfamiliar territory. They discuss ways to get out of the area, and Dennis asks to see Randall. They talk briefly, and Dennis treats Randall much more kindly after seeing his first trip into the outer orbits. Even though the others are angry at Randall, he tells them there will be no feuds on the ship, and they re-enter the cruiser. \n"}]}, {"question_text": "What is the attitude of Dennis towards Marla?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "87a2a5c010e14561a3d5059e118027f3", "response_text": "Marla used to be a fiancee of Dennis, but she broke up with him and left for an assignment.

It would\ngive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate\nloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him\nto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin\nteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable\nlectures to a bored and captive audience of one.\nHe would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether\nit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as\ndirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and\nthink more like a god than any man for generations.\nBut after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing\nbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.\nNot that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already\ntalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had\ncut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and\nwinked at it whenever he passed that way.\nLately she was winking back at him.\nLoneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from\nhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.\nNo one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet\ncould only be this lonely on Mars.\nManet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.\nAll Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle\nof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,\nflat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the\nblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons\nand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole\ngimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was\nneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.\nThe Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't\ntake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully\nspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb\nMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.\nThey didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people\nfor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to\nisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet\nand his fellows.\nThe Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare\nto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter\nservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations\nfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't\nproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between\nthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.\nBut it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered\nwonderful opportunities.\nIt gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making\na tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as\nbright as envy.\nManet suspected hallucination, but in an existence with all the pallid\ndispassion of a requited love he was happy to welcome dementia.\nSometimes he even manufactured it. Sometimes he would run through the\narteries of the factory and play that it had suddenly gone mad hating\nhuman beings, and was about to close down its bulkheads on him as sure\nas the Engineers' Thumb and bale up the pressure-dehydrated digest,\nmaking so much stall flooring of him. He ran until he dropped with a\nkind of climaxing release of terror.\nSo Manet put on the pressure suit he had been given because he would\nnever need it, and marched out to meet the visiting spaceship.\nHe wasn't quite clear how he came from walking effortlessly across\nthe Martian plain that had all the distance-perpetuating qualities of\na kid's crank movie machine to the comfortable interior of a strange\ncabin. Not a ship's cabin but a Northwoods cabin.\nThe black and orange Hallowe'en log charring in the slate stone\nfireplace seemed real. So did the lean man with the smiling mustache\npainted with the random designs of the fire, standing before the\nhorizontal pattern of chinked wall.\n\"Need a fresher?\" the host inquired.\nManet's eyes wondered down to heavy water tumbler full of rich, amber\nwhiskey full of sparks from the hearth. He stirred himself in the\ncomfortingly warm leather chair. \"No, no, I'm\nfine\n.\" He let the word\nhang there for examination. \"Pardon me, but could you tell me just what\nplace this is?\"\nThe host shrugged. It was the only word for it. \"Whatever place you\nchoose it to be, so long as you're with Trader Tom. 'Service,' that's\nmy motto. It is a way of life with me.\"\n\"Trader Tom? Service?\"\n\"Yes! That's it exactly. It's\nme\nexactly. Trader Tom Service\u2014Serving\nthe Wants of the Spaceman Between the Stars. Of course, 'stars' is\npoetic. Any point of light in the sky in a star. We service the\nplanets.\"\nManet took the tumbler in both hands and drank. It was good whiskey,\nimmensely powerful. \"The government wouldn't pay for somebody serving\nthe wants of spacemen,\" he exploded.\n\"Ah,\" Trader Tom said, cautionary. He moved nearer the fire and warmed\nhis hands and buttocks. \"Ah, but I am not a\ngovernment\nservice. I\nrepresent free enterprise.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" Manet said. \"No group of private individuals can build a\nspaceship. It takes a combine of nations.\"\n\"But remember only that businessmen are reactionary. It's well-known.\nAsk anyone on the street. Businessmen are reactionary even beyond the\ncapitalistic system. Money is a fiction that exists mostly on paper.\nThey play along on paper to get paper things, but to get real things\nthey can forego the papers. Comprehend,\nmon ami\n? My businessmen\nhave gone back to the barter system. Between them, they have the raw\nmaterials, the trained men, the man-hours to make a spaceship. So they\nmake it. Damned reactionaries, all of my principals.\"\n\"I don't believe you,\" Manet stated flatly. His conversation had grown\nblunt with disuse. \"What possible profit could your principals turn\nfrom running a trading ship among scattered exploration posts on the\nplanets? What could you give us that a benevolent government doesn't\nalready supply us with? And if there was anything, how could we pay for\nit? My year's salary wouldn't cover the transportation costs of this\nglass of whiskey.\"\n\"Do you find it good whiskey?\"\n\"Very good.\"\n\"Excellent?\"\n\"Excellent, if you prefer.\"\n\"I only meant\u2014but never mind. We give you what you want. As for\npaying for it\u2014why, forget about the payment. You may apply for a\nTrader Tom Credit Card.\"\n\"And I could buy anything that I wanted with it?\" Manet demanded.\n\"That's absurd. I'd never be able to pay for it.\"\n\"That's it precisely!\" Trader Tom said with enthusiasm. \"You\nnever\npay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your\nestate\n.\"\n\"But I may leave no estate!\"\nTrader Tom demonstrated his peculiar shrug. \"All businesses operate on\na certain margin of risk. That is our worry.\"\nManet finished the mellow whiskey and looked into the glass. It seemed\nto have been polished clean. \"What do you have to offer?\"\n\"Whatever you want?\"\nIrritably, \"How do I know what I want until I know what you have?\"\n\"You know.\"\n\"I know? All right, I know. You don't have it for sale.\"\n\"Old chap, understand if you please that I do not only\nsell\n. I\nam a trader\u2014Trader Tom. I trade with many parties. There are, for\nexample ... extraterrestrials.\"\n\"Folk legend!\"\n\"On the contrary,\nmon cher\n, the only reality it lacks is political\nreality. The Assembly could no longer justify their disposition of\nthe cosmos if it were known they were dealing confiscation without\nrepresentation. Come, tell me what you want.\"\nManet gave in to it. \"I want to be not alone,\" he said.\n\"Of course,\" Trader Tom replied, \"I suspected. It is not so unusual,\nyou know. Sign here. And here. Two copies. This is yours. Thank you so\nmuch.\"\nManet handed back the pen and stared at the laminated card in his hand.\nWhen he looked up from the card, Manet saw the box. Trader Tom was\npushing it across the floor towards him.\nThe box had the general dimensions of a coffin, but it wasn't\nwood\u2014only brightly illustrated cardboard. There was a large four-color\npicture on the lid showing men, women and children moving through a\nbusy city street. The red and blue letters said:\nLIFO\nThe Socialization Kit\n\"It is commercialized,\" Trader Tom admitted with no little chagrin.\n\"It is presented to appeal to a twelve-year-old child, an erotic,\naggressive twelve-year-old, the typical sensie goer\u2014but that is\nreality. It offends men of good taste like ourselves, yet sometimes it\napproaches being art. We must accept it.\"\n\"What's the cost?\" Manet asked. \"Before I accept it, I have to know the\ncharges.\"\n\"You never know the cost. Only your executor knows that. It's the\nTrader Tom plan.\"\n\"Well, is it guaranteed?\"\n\"There are no guarantees,\" Trader Tom admitted. \"But I've never had any\ncomplaints yet.\"\n\"Suppose I'm the first?\" Manet suggested reasonably.\n\"You won't be,\" Trader Tom said. \"I won't pass this way again.\"\nManet didn't open the box. He let it fade quietly in the filtered but\nstill brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall.\nManet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper\ntaste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to\nhimself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.\nFinally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk,\nsuppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the\nconclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.\nSo he went to open the box.\nThe cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It\ncrumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the\nboxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.\nThe contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old\nchemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and\nunremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to\nhave been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime.\nOn top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the\nReader's\nDigest\n, covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in\nblack on the spine and cover:\nThe Making of Friends\n.\nManet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title\nin larger print and slightly amplified:\nThe Making of Friends and\nOthers\n. There was no author listed. A further line of information\nstated: \"A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.\" At the bottom of\nthe title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD.,\nSYRACUSE.\nThe unnumbered first chapter was headed\nYour First Friend\n.\nBefore you go further, first find the\nModifier\nin your kit. This\nis\nvital\n.\nHe quickly riffled through the pages.\nOther Friends, Authority, A\nCompanion\n.... Then\nThe Final Model\n. Manet tried to flip past this\nsection, but the pages after the sheet labeled\nThe Final Model\nwere\nstuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in\nthe back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to\nthis section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.\nManet flipped back to page one.\nFirst find the\nModifier\nin your kit. This is\nvital\nto your entire\nexperiment in socialization. The\nModifier is Part #A-1\non the Master\nChart.\nHe prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There\nwas nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and\nlooked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its\noutside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits.\nMaybe even the\nModifier\nitself.\nHe read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He\nstudied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand.\nThe toe bone was connected to the foot bone....\nThe Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner.\nThe Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration.\nThe Red King crabbed sideways one square.\nThe Black King pounced forward one space.\nThe Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy.\nThe Black King shuffled sideways.\nThe Red King followed....\nUselessly.\n\"Tie game,\" Ronald said.\n\"Tie game,\" Manet said.\n\"Let's talk,\" Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.\nCheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him.\nCheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in\norder to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible.\n\"The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars,\" Ronald said\npontifically.\n\"Only in the air,\" Manet corrected him.\nIntelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress.\nIntelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know\nany more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to\nthat when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder.\n\"There were no dogfights in Korea,\" Ronald said.\n\"I know.\"\n\"The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the\nlast of which took place near the end of the First World War. The\naerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not\nseen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for\nsingle passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts,\nthat this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the\nleisurely combats of World War One.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to be\nwarm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic.\"\n\"I know.\"\nManet knew it all. He had heard it all before.\nHe was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, Daniel\nBoone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines,\nthe painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing,\nad nauseum\n. What a\nnarrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thought\nand concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginal\nhuman being?\nOf course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy.\nManet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties\u2014Lt. \"Hoot\" Gibson,\nSam Merwin tennis stories,\nSaturday Evening Post\ncovers\u2014when he had\nfirst learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firm\nopinions on all these.\nHe yearned for someone to challenge him\u2014to say that\nDime Sports\nhad\nbeen nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why,\nSewanee Review\n, there\nhad been a magazine for you.\nManet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than his\nown. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superior\nto the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was a\nbetter band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk.\n\"Ronald,\" Manet said, \"you are a terrific jerk.\"\nRonald leaped up immediately and led with his right.\nManet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross.\nRonald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel.\nThe two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing the\ndiesel works, closed again.\nRonald leaped forward and led with his right.\nManet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge of\nRonald's jaw.\nRonald pinwheeled to the floor.\nHe lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth.\n\"Had enough?\" he asked Manet.\nManet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. \"Yes.\"\nRonald hopped up lightly. \"Another checkers, Billy Boy?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer.\"\nManet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury.\nRonald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get in\na fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manet\nwanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid.\nManet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard.\nBut if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it that\ntheir checker games always ended in a tie?\nThe calendar said it was Spring on Earth when the radio was activated\nfor a high-speed information and entertainment transmission.\nThe buzzer-flasher activated in the solarium at the same time.\nManet lay stretched out on his back, naked, in front of the transparent\nwall.\nBy rolling his eyes back in his head, Manet could see over a hedge of\neyebrows for several hundred flat miles of white sand.\nAnd several hundred miles of desert could see him.\nFor a moment he gloried in the blatant display of his flabby muscles\nand patchy sunburn.\nThen he sighed, rolled over to his feet and started trudging toward\nCommunication.\nHe padded down the rib-ridged matted corridor, taking his usual small\npleasure in the kaleidoscopic effect of the spiraling reflections on\nthe walls of the tubeway.\nAs he passed the File Room, he caught the sound of the pounding\nvibrations against the stoppered plug of the hatch.\n\"Come on, Billy Buddy, let me out of this place!\"\nManet padded on down the hall. He had, he recalled, shoved Ronald\nin there on Lincoln's Birthday, a minor ironic twist he appreciated\nquietly. He had been waiting in vain for Ronald to run down ever since.\nIn Communication, he took a seat and punched the slowed down playback\nof the transmission.\n\"Hello, Overseers,\" the Voice said. It was the Voice of the B.B.C.\nIt irritated Manet. He never understood how the British had got the\nspace transmissions assignment for the English language. He would have\npreferred an American disk-jockey himself, one who appreciated New York\nswing.\n\"We imagine that you are most interested in how long you shall\nbe required to stay at your present stations,\" said the Voice of\nGod's paternal uncle. \"As you on Mars may know, there has been much\ndiscussion as to how long it will require to complete the present\nschedule\u2014\" there was of course no \"K\" sound in the word\u2014\"for\natmosphere seeding.\n\"The original, non-binding estimate at the time of your departure was\n18.2 years. However, determining how long it will take our stations\nproperly to remake the air of Mars is a problem comparable to finding\nthe age of the Earth. Estimates change as new factors are learned. You\nmay recall that three years ago the official estimate was changed to\nthirty-one years. The recent estimate by certain reactionary sources\nof two hundred and seventy-four years is\nnot\nan official government\nestimate. The news for you is good, if you are becoming nostalgic for\nhome, or not particularly bad if you are counting on drawing your\nhandsome salary for the time spent on Mars. We have every reason to\nbelieve our\noriginal\nestimate was substantially correct. The total\ntime is, within limits of error, a flat 18 years.\"\nA very flat 18 years, Manet thought as he palmed off the recorder.\nHe sat there thinking about eighteen years.\nHe did not switch to video for some freshly taped westerns.\nFinally, Manet went back to the solarium and dragged the big box out.\nThere was a lot left inside.\nOne of those parts, one of those bones or struts of flesh sprayers, one\nof them, he now knew, was the Modifier.\nThe Modifier was what he needed to change Ronald. Or to shut him off.\nIf only the Master Chart hadn't been lost, so he would know what the\nModifier looked like! He hoped the Modifier itself wasn't lost. He\nhated to think of Ronald locked in the Usher tomb of the File Room\nfor 18 flat years. Long before that, he would have worn his fists away\nhammering at the hatch. Then he might start pounding with his head.\nPerhaps before the time was up he would have worn himself down to\nnothing whatsoever.\nManet selected the ripple-finished gray-covered manual from the\nhodgepodge, and thought: eighteen years.\nPerhaps I should have begun here, he told himself. But I really don't\nhave as much interest in that sort of thing as the earthier types.\nSimple companionship was all I wanted. And, he thought on, even an\ninsipid personality like Ronald's would be bearable with certain\ncompensations.\nManet opened the book to the chapter headed:\nThe Making of a Girl\n.\nVeronica crept up behind Manet and slithered her hands up his back and\nover his shoulders. She leaned forward and breathed a moist warmth into\nhis ear, and worried the lobe with her even white teeth.\n\"Daniel Boone,\" she sighed huskily, \"only killed three Indians in his\nlife.\"\n\"I know.\"\nManet folded his arms stoically and added: \"Please don't talk.\"\nShe sighed her instant agreement and moved her expressive hands over\nhis chest and up to the hollows of his throat.\n\"I need a shave,\" he observed.\nHer hands instantly caressed his face to prove that she liked a rather\nbristly, masculine countenance.\nManet elbowed Veronica away in a gentlemanly fashion.\nShe made her return.\n\"Not now,\" he instructed her.\n\"Whenever you say.\"\nHe stood up and began pacing off the dimensions of the compartment.\nThere was no doubt about it: he had been missing his regular exercise.\n\"Now?\" she asked.\n\"I'll tell you.\"\n\"If you were a jet pilot,\" Veronica said wistfully, \"you would be\nromantic. You would grab love when you could. You would never know\nwhich moment would be last. You would make the most of each one.\"\n\"I'm not a jet pilot,\" Manet said. \"There are no jet pilots. There\nhaven't been any for generations.\"\n\"Don't be silly,\" Veronica said. \"Who else would stop those vile North\nKoreans and Red China 'volunteers'?\"\n\"Veronica,\" he said carefully, \"the Korean War is over. It was finished\neven before the last of the jet pilots.\"\n\"Don't be silly,\" she snapped. \"If it were over, I'd know about it,\nwouldn't I?\"\nShe would, except that somehow she had turned out even less bright,\nless equipped with Manet's own store of information, than Ronald.\nWhoever had built the Lifo kit must have had ancient ideas about what\nconstituted appropriate \"feminine\" characteristics.\n\"I suppose,\" he said heavily, \"that you would like me to take you back\nto Earth and introduce you to Daniel Boone?\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\"Veronica, your stupidity is hideous.\"\nShe lowered her long blonde lashes on her pink cheeks. \"That is a mean\nthing to say to me. But I forgive you.\"\nAn invisible hand began pressing down steadily on the top of his head\nuntil it forced a sound out of him. \"Aaaawrraagggh! Must you be so\ncloyingly sweet? Do you have to keep taking that? Isn't there any fight\nin you at all?\"\nHe stepped forward and back-handed her across the jaw.\nIt was the first time he had ever struck a woman, he realized\nregretfully. He now knew he should have been doing it long ago.\nVeronica sprang forward and led with a right.\nRonald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the\ncorridor.\n\"Hear that?\" he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth.\n\"No, darling.\"\nWell, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore\nthe noise. She was still following orders.\n\"Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald,\" the voice carried\nthrough sepulchrally.\n\"Shut up!\" Manet yelled.\nThe voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off.\nA silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it.\nWhy hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took\ncomfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the\nstation.\nManet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch.\nRonald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His\nhands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips\nseemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the\nshouting but from having nothing to drink for some months.\nRonald didn't say anything to Manet.\nBut he looked offended.\n\"You,\" Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back,\n\"inside, inside.\"\nRonald sidestepped the lurching girl.\n\"Do you know what I'm going to do with you?\" Manet demanded. \"I'm going\nto lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year,\nforever! Now what do you think about that?\"\n\"If you think it's the\nright\nthing, dear,\" Veronica said hesitantly.\n\"You know best, Willy,\" Ronald said uncertainly.\nManet slammed the hatch in disgust.\nManet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of\nhis reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk\ncarefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he\nwalked too carefully for this to happen.\nAs he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: \"In my opinion,\nWilliam, you should let us out.\"\n\"I,\" Veronica said, \"honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill,\ndearest.\"\nManet giggled. \"What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you\nback after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?\"\nHe went down the corridor, giggling.\nHe giggled and thought: This will never do.\nPouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual\ndiligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the\nbox to go around.\nThe book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The\nModel Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.\nHe would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make\nany one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.\nHe wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from\nhim for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.\nOr to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.\nBut Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.\nManet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did\nso, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.\nHe glanced forward and found the headings:\nThe Final Model\n.\nThere seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid\na price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to\nthat? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he\ncould.\nHe read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of\nill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and\nunder his fingers....\nManet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.\nVictor was finished. Perfect.\nManet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.\n\"Move!\"\nVictor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the\nflesh-sprayers.\nAs the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized\nthat it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.\n\"It's finished!\" were Victor's first words. \"It's done!\"\nManet stared at the tiny wreck. \"To say the least.\"\nVictor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should\nunderstand. I am different from the others.\"\n\"They all say that.\"\n\"I am not your friend.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\"\nManet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure\nat the symmetry of the situation.\n\"It completes the final course in socialization,\" Victor continued. \"I\nam your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have\nall\nyour knowledge.\nYou\ndo not have all your knowledge. If you let\nyourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is\nmy function to use everything I possibly can against you.\"\n\"When do you start?\"\n\"I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.\"\n\"What's so bad about that?\" Manet asked with some interest.\n\"You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never\nchange. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your\ninterest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll\nnever change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I've\nmade the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man.\nI've\nseen that you will always keep your friends.\n\"\nThe prospect\nwas\nfrightful.\nVictor smiled. \"Aren't you going to denounce me for a fiend?\"\n\"Yes, it is time for the denouncement. Tell me, you feel that now you\nare through? You have fulfilled your function?\"\n\"Yes. Yes.\"\n\"Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see\nme suffer?\"\n\"\nYes.\n\"\n\"No. Can't do it, old man. Can't.\nI\nknow. You're too human, too\nlike me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state\nof uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to be\nhappening to him. He has to be happening to something. You didn't kill\nme because then you would have nothing left to do. You'll never kill\nme.\"\n\"Of course not!\" Victor stormed. \"Fundamental safety cut-off!\"\n\"Rationalization. You don't\nwant\nto kill me. And you can't stop\nchallenging me at every turn. That's your function.\"\n\"Stop talking and just think about your miserable life,\" Victor said\nmeanly. \"Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't make\nany new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of your\nuselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's that\nfor boredom, for passiveness?\"\n\"That's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Manet said irritably, his social\nmanners rusty. \"I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your\npurpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every\nfoot of the way. Don't you see?

He is an overseer, to prepare the atmosphere for colonization. One day, Manet thinks he sees a spaceship land near his station. He puts on his pressure suit and heads out to see what it is. As he walks towards it, he finds himself in a rustic log cabin, where a lean, tall man stands, waiting for him. The man calls himself \"Trader Tom\", and offers him a very interesting service. He tells Manet that he will give him a special credit card that will allow him to purchase anything he can think of. Manet's estate would cover the cost, and when Manet asks the man what would happen if he had no estate, Trader Tom simply says that this is a risk that he, and his business, take. Trader Tom asks what would Manet like, to which he replies: to not be alone. Manet signs some paperwork and is given the credit card. \nManet is given a box, it is called \"LIFO, the socialisation kit\". The box contains various items from a person's lifetime. On top is a book entitled \"The Making Of Friends and Others''. It orders the user to find the modifier, which Manet cannot locate.

He goes out to meet the spaceship, and the other man introduces himself as Trader Tom. He says that he serves the wants of spacemen and represents free enterprise. When Manet is suspicious, Tom explains that his businessmen have gone back to the barter system. Furthermore, Manet can also apply for the Trader Tom\u2019s Credit Card and have charges deducted from his estate as payment. He tells Tom that he wants to be alone, and Tom lets him sign a card.

When Victor is created, he immediately leaps inside the box, smashing up something Manet thinks to be a flesh sprayer. When it is destroyed, Manet finally realises that it is in fact, the Modifier. Victor explains the modifier's purpose. The modifier is used to change the artificial beings. They are created based on the creator's likes and dislikes.

There is no definitive answer as to how he gets onto the ship, or who or what Trader Tom works for. When Manet finishes the glass of whiskey, it becomes instantly clean, like he had never drank from it. His ship is also very strange, with a fireplace in it. We can later see Manet's madness in his violent outbursts. We first see him beat up Ronald, and then Veronica.

BADE\nIllustrated by L. WOROMAY\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nTo the men of the future, the scientific\ngoals of today were as incomprehensible\nas the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\nThere was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\nWhat had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\nSomething moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\nThis time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\nThis wasn't his room!\nThe lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\nShock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\nNow\nhe remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\nWhere was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\nHe thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\nHe pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in\nthe details, he had the impression that there was something wrong\nabout it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no\nstraight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in\nfeatureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal,\nhalf ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table,\nbuilt apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression\nof arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish\ndesign, something about the room still was not right.\nHis eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer\none. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this\none, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He\npressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at\nthe disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.\nThere was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of\ncausing it to open.\nBaffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window\u2014and\nrealized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.\nIt did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....\nStriding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently\nbanged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then\nreached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff\nso transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass!\nGlass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he\nhadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.\nHe looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character\nof the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became\naware that he was hungry.\nWhere the devil could this place be? And\u2014muscles tightened about his\nempty stomach\u2014what was in store for him here?\nHe stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless,\nuntil a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew\nhis attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his\neyes to see what it was.\nA man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they\nhad been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his\nneck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.\nMaitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he\ndidn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time\nof year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look\nScandinavian....\nAs they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans\nand showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained\nfor years with weights. They vanished below his field of view,\npresumably into the building.\nHe sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor.\nAbout half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the\nwall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and\nsandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood\nup and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he\nmade an unimpressive figure.\nThe fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed\nwere the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.\nThe dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from\nswimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.\nThis man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of\nhimself.\nSomehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head\nof a thinker, the body of a trained athlete\u2014an unusual combination.\nImpassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where\nyou are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but\notherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth\nto protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the\nguessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.\n\"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have\nthree meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to\nleave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in\nany way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that\nwe want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart\njumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I\nwant to give you some psychological tests....\"\n\"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this\nmoment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll\nadmit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here\u2014but it\nseems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give\nyour tests to.\"\nBriefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now,\ncome with me.\"\nAfter that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather\ncommonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and\na bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple\nof them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal\ncomplement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran\nacross the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the\ncenter of the room.\n\"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,\n\"Understand one thing\u2014the more you cooperate, the easier things will\nbe for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results\nagainst your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make\nme.\"\n\"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\"\nSwarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an\nanswer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie\ndetector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I\ngive you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\"\nMaitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed\nmuscles. \"Make me.\"\nIf Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\"\nhe said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if\nyou'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\"\nMaitland shook his head stubbornly.\n\"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\"\nHe moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the\nsolar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.\nHe felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on\nthe cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across\nhis chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a\nclamp that held his head immovable.\nPresently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and\nto other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to\nthe skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung\nfrom the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around\nhis left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box\nclamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined\nthe others.\nSo\u2014Maitland thought\u2014Swarts could record changes in his skin\npotential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of\nthe body to stimuli.\nThe question was, what were the stimuli to be?\n\"Your name,\" said Swarts, \"is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four\nyears old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly\nas applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to\nquestion you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is\nMadison, Wisconsin....\"\n\"You seem to know everything about me,\" Maitland said defiantly,\nlooking up into the hanging forest of cabling. \"Why this recital?\"\n\"I do not know everything about you\u2014yet. And I'm testing the\nequipment, calibrating it to your reactions.\" He went on, \"Your\nfavorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science\nfiction. Maitland,\nhow would you like to go to the Moon\n?\"\nSomething eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and\nhe tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. \"What do\nyou mean?\"\nSwarts was chuckling. \"I really hit a semantic push-button there,\ndidn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants\nto go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out\nwhy\n.\"\nIn the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid\naside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for\nseveral seconds.\nShe had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that\nglowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of\nblonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless\nblouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her\nbody, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what\nseemed to be white wool.\nShe was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like\nexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down\nself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.\nShe smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak\nbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed\ndoor for a minute after she was gone.\nLater, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded\ncarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his\nstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset\nand to think.\nThere were three questions for which he required answers before he\ncould formulate any plan or policy.\nWhere was he?\nWho was Swarts?\nWhat was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given?\nIt was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme\nfor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the\ncontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the\nappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been\nnothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from\nforeign intelligence officers.\nIt might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at\nthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to\nthink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there\nwas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be\ncultivated, not allowed to go to grass.\nThis might be somewhere in Africa....\nHe shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued\nglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get\nhold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.\nAfter a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,\na backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,\nMaitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of\npeace and an undefinable longing.\nVenus, the most beautiful of the planets.\nMaitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the\nconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he\nhad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,\nits transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the\nhorizon, and loved it equally in its\nalter ego\nof morning star. Venus\nwas an old friend. An old friend....\nSomething icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and\ndiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists\nclenched, forgetting to breathe.\nLast night Venus hadn't been there.\nVenus was a morning star just now....\nJust now!\nHe realized the truth in that moment.\nLater, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\nOnly one question of importance remained:\nWhat year was this?\nHe grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\nfuture\n! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\nSomewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\nAnd\nhe\nhad a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n\"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\nIf\u2014\nSuddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\nAfter a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\nHe woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He\nrolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the\nevening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\nAs he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\nShe turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n\"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n\"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n\"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\nStartlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her\nshoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n\"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\nShe shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n\"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\nShe grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\nSwarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned\noffensive.\n\"What year is this?\"\nSwarts' steely eyes locked with his. \"You know what the date is,\" he\nstated.\n\"No, I don't. Not since yesterday.\"\n\"Come on,\" Swarts said patiently, \"let's get going. We have a lot to\nget through this morning.\"\n\"I\nknow\nthis isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.\nVenus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an\nevening star.\"\n\"Never mind that. Come.\"\nWordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the\nlaboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach\nthe instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started\nsaying a list of words\u2014doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction\ntest\u2014Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc\n  3\n  x dx\" in his head.\nIt was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent\ntracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts\nhad stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man\nstanding over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.\n\"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.\n\"We'll try another series of tests.\"\nIt took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He\nlowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks\nof a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at\nthe ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's\neyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.\n\"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can\nblink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down\nagainst the tension.\"\nHe inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears\u2014\nAnd then the show began.\nHe was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were\nfootsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,\nand outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a\ntwelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you\nwife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.\nThere was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless\npowder\u2014then blackness.\nWith a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to\nslow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test\u2014what was the\ncountermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them\ndeclared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.\nNow he was looking at a girl. She....\nMaitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.\nHe thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day\nafter school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had\nall the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no\nmore. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of\nSwarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this\nnew world.\nWithin a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened\nagainst the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his\nforehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....\nThe scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.\nThere was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and\nswollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.\nThe scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his\neyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at\nhim for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was\nstarting to ache from the effort of blinking.\n\"What year is this?\" he asked.\n\"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"\nMaitland's smile became a grin.\n\"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said\na while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.\nIf you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"'\n\"Ching?\"\n\"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\"\nMaitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\nThat evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\nHe forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\nFinally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n\"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\nMaitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\nShe shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n\"How do you mean\u2014\" Maitland wrinkled his brow\u2014\"adapt to modern\nculture? Don't tell me\nyou're\nfrom another time!\"\n\"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head\nof a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much\nbehind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old\ntongue.\"\nHe looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\nHis fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\nMaitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n\"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n\"So many? How?\"\n\"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n\"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.\"\n\"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\nShe shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n\"Rebellion?\"\n\"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\nThey were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n\"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n\"Inter-what?\"\n\"Have men visited the stars?\"\nShe shook her head, bewildered.\n\"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\nHe waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\nAfter several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\nShe frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\nHe was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n\"A\nship\n? Oh, you mean something like a\nvliegvlotter\n. Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\nHe was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\nShe nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\nHe sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\nThe cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders\nand fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes\nand looked at her. \"I just don't understand,\" he said. \"It seemed\nobvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd\ndo it.\"\nHer pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he\nwas facing her. \"I've got to understand. I've got to know\nwhy\n. What\nhappened? Why don't men want the planets any more?\"\n\"Honestly,\" she said, \"I did not know they ever had.\" She hesitated.\n\"Maybe you are asking the wrong question.\"\nHe furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.\n\"I mean,\" she explained, \"maybe you should ask why people in the 20th\nCentury\ndid\nwant to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.\"\nMaitland felt his face become hot. \"Men can go anywhere, if they want\nto bad enough.\"\n\"But\nwhy\n?\"\nDespite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick\nto logic. \"Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to\nthe population problem....\"\n\"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that\nthe key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic\nsystem was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we\nhave held the number at that.\"\n\"Birth control,\" Maitland scoffed. \"How do you make it work\u2014secret\npolice?\"\n\"No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we\ncherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those\ntwo are the best children we could possibly produce....\"\nShe broke off, looking a little self-conscious. \"You understand, what\nI have been saying applies to\nmost\nof the world. In some places like\nAresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I\nbelong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of\nthem.\"\n\"Even,\" he said, \"granting that you have solved the population problem,\nthere's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must\nbe men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in\nyour blood, the idea of going to Mars\u2014just to go there and see what's\nthere and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested\nin finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of\nVenus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance\nof only two hundred thousand miles?\" His hands were trembling as he\nstopped.\nShe shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"Go into the past\u2014yes! But go out\nthere? I still cannot see why.\"\n\"Has the spirit of adventure\nevaporated\nfrom the human race, or\nwhat\n?\"\nShe smiled. \"In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts\nkilled the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time\ntraveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the\nway I feel. Listen, Bob.\" She laid a hand on his arm. \"You grew up in\nthe Age of Technology. Everybody was terribly excited about what could\nbe done with machines\u2014machines to blow up a city all at once, or fly\naround the world, or take a man to Mars. We have had our fill of\u2014what\nis the word?\u2014gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they\nfunction right, we are satisfied to forget about them.\n\"Because this is the Age of\nMan\n.

As Maitland wonders helplessly, a man by the name of Swarts enters his room. Swarts tells Maitland that he is here to participate in a series of psychological tests, assuring him that he is not interested in any secret intelligence related to his career. Swarts leads Maitland to his laboratory, where a cot stands in the center of the room under a ceiling of electric cables. Maitland resists initially, wary of the extent Swarts would go to in order for him to comply; however, Swarts manages to get Maitland onto the cot by force. He then reveals his main objective, which is figuring out why Maitland has a passion and longing to go to the Moon. Later that evening, Maitland meets a girl, later referred to as Ingrid Ching, who silently brings him a meal. He stares outside his window, trying to piece together where he could be, when he notices the presence of Venus in the sky as an evening star and comes to the realization that he has traveled to the future. Bewildered, Maitland is eager to learn more about the advancements of society, namely the status of man's trip to space. He asks Ching, who refuses to answer, and is then brought back to Swarts' lab. Maitland, determined to have his questions answered, rebels against Swarts' following tests through mental resistance. Becoming frustrated, Swarts tells Maitland that they are in the year A.D 2634, and that Ching would answer remaining questions if he complied with the tests. Agreeing, Ching visits Maitland that evening, and indulges him in the history of the human race up to this point, including stories of the Afrikanders, who dominated technological advancements and ruled the global empire, and how the world eventually transformed into one race. Maitland asks Ching whether humans have been able to go to space yet, and she is perplexed. She tells him that though she doesn't think it would be impossible, it has not been done, and she wonders why such a thing would be desired. Ching explains that the world is no longer in an age of technology, but an age of understanding humans and cultures within their world. Maitland is defeated; he cannot comprehend how there is no interest in traveling to space, realizing that his lifelong goal has become unattainable.

Three more\nshelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\nhe would be among the living again.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Summer 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nHe heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws\ngroping into space, and then the star-port closed.\nThere was another dead man aboard the\nConstellation\n.\nSam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and\nquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;\nmachines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see\nanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of\nthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,\nkeeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\nBurnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical\ngown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all\ntight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.\nOpening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor\nwarrior's body out of the void.\nHe didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and\nforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back\nfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,\nwho just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a\ndecent burial.\n\"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice\nfrom the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,\nninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight\nsurgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded\ndeep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\nRice said:\n\"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day\ndrunk!\"\nBurnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them\ninto a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and\nshoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one\nanother in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,\nsalvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\nTwo men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred\nother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\nTen years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots\ninside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the\nhusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved\nfor action.\nThis would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\"Sam!\"\nBurnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative\nlab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator\nshelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to\nlife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\nBurnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was\nworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred\nthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood\ncooling in it.\nShaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed\nup into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed\nwithout making any noise on the rungs.\nHe kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget.\nYou never catch up with the war.\nAll the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across\nstars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the\ntitanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited\nglory are always a million miles ahead.\nHe bit his teeth together.\nYou never catch up with the war.\nYou come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped\ntrembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the\ndark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of\nits original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see\nit; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your\nribs.\nYou see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by\ngrinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over\nfeet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space\nsuits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred\nbillion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you\nextended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\nThat was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering\nsilence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up\nall too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\nYou wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.\nAfter ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing\nyour job with mechanical hands.\nBut even a machine breaks down....\n\"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.\nRed and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy\nofficial. \"Take a look at this!\"\nBurnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong\nwith the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it\nwas.\nMaybe it was because the body looked a little\ntoo\ndead.\nBurnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,\nstood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as\ndelicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly\nblue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed\nclose to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a\ncluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed\ncompletely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\nBurnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\nRice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and\nblack. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\nBurnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\nBurnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That\nright?\"\n\"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in\nspace, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\nBurnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.\nWhat the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone\nelse.\nRice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!\nKriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That\nmeans Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\nSam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.\n\"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the\nVenus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the\nday you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick\nof it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling\nthrough the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good\ngreen Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution\nis taken to protect that one.\"\n\"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a\nbattle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\"We'll radio for help?\"\n\"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred\nthousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has\nswept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\nRice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw\nhard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His\nfingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,\n\"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\nBurnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's\nbarrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and\ndays and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads\nbloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who\nstart out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\nBurnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.\nHe stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,\nhearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own\nheart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't\ncare much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?\nLethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine\nbeside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\nRice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\nLethla was alive.\nHe rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.\nHe didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the\nnecessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what\nlanguage it would use if it had to.\nBurnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he\nknew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a\npale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it\nlike a dead cold star.\nRice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From\nthe corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,\nbiting lines into his sharp face.\nRice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.\n\"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\nA crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head.\nYou\nnever catch up with the war!\nBut what if the war catches up with you?\nWhat in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?\nLethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the\nchugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick\nfingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the\nhalves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off\nof his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been\ninserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\nHe spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,\nEarthman.\"\n\"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\nLethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to\nan unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the\nhead. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed\nas you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible\nat all.\"\nPrickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and\nthe Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and\nquick.\nBurnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came\naboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\nLethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's\nyour radio?\"\n\"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.\n\"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock\nis safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the\nladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and\ncoils. The radio.\nBurnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his\nfeet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by\nthe new bitterness in it.\nLethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\nHe smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\nRice said it, slow:\n\"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead\nmen belong here.\"\nLethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead\nmen there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\nBurnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes\nlidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.\nLethla's voice came next:\n\"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus\nat an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these\nair-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked\nunexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the\nlife-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing\ntheir lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the\nEarth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.\nWe were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture\nwas certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a\nsmall time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our\nchrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to\ntrick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too\nlate and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for\nbrief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\nRice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the\nprotection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe\nto Venus.\"\nLethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing\nsafe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be\npicked up\u2014\nnow!\n\"\nRice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time\nin years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\nBurnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on\nboard the\nConstellation\nin half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\"Follow me up the ladder.\"\nLethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\nBurnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.\nRice grumbled and cursed after him.\nOn the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like\na white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never\nknew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number\nninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\nThere were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And\nwhat more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he\nchewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo\nwouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you\nnever knew who it would be.\nHe came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over\nthe hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that\nwas one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.\nChronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a\nslow pace.\nBurnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?\nSee him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be\nhard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out\nalive; if they cooperated.\nBut there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves\nin the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were\nstirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored.\nYou may never catch up with the war again.\nThe last trip!\nYes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what\nridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\nTwo muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his\nbody vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,\nwet thin lips.\n\"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\nLethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\"Very,\" said Burnett.\nHe was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies\nbeing ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of\nhating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it\nwould all be over.\nBurnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like\nfluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,\nhe squinted.\n\"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good\ntrick.\"\n\"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\"\nBurnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,\neyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to\nLethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last\ntime anybody would ever board the\nConstellation\nalive. His stomach\nwent flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\nIf Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end\nof shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind\nsearching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\nKriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like\na smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,\nwater-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy\njet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be\neliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored\nbecause of his gun.\nKriere would make odds impossible.\nSomething had to be done before Kriere came in.\nLethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,\nfooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\nBurnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade\nwhere Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,\nartery\u2014heart.\nThere was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and\nthis would be the last trip.\nSweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there\nwas too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in\nthe center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the\nstar-port.\"\nBurnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.\nBurnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back\nkept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet\nsings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,\nwhy\u2014\nKriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of\nstars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the\nConstellation\n. Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about\nto be rescued.\nBurnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he\nwas about to end a ten-years' war.\nThere was only\none\nway of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be\nfast.\nBurnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as\nit had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a\ngood sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered\ndirections, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies\nfrom space.\nLethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,\ntoo.\nThe claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its\nslowness.\nIt reached Kriere.\nBurnett inhaled a deep breath.\nThe metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.\nLethla watched.\nHe watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You\nknow, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the\nConstellation\n. I believe it.\"\nAnd the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all\naround Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There\nwas blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the\nhead, which was carefully preserved for identification.\nThat was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\nBurnett spun about and leaped.\nThe horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\nRice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot\nramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back\nlike a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\nFists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and\nscreaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the\nroom swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and\nstarted laughing.\nHe didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever\nclaws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\nOut of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's\nyoung face over him. Burnett groaned.\nRice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.\nSomething wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last\ntrip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never\nhave to come aboard the\nConstellation\n, though, Rice.\" His voice\ntrailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll\nbe next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\nSomething happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his\nmouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of\nthem out:\n\"Rice?\"\n\"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling\nthe shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is\nLethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling\nthis rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who\nwant to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back\nany way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\nHis voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen\nwarriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and\nBurnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a\nmillion miles.\n\"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\nThen everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to\ndissolve.\nNinety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\nHe could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing\nout and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,\nthick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf\nat the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\nAnd then he said softly:\n\"\nOne hundred.\n\"\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "6026b7dd8d0a41ea927c257ff208c0a6", "response_text": "Sam Burnett hears the familiar sounds that indicate another dead body has been retrieved and collected onto the Morgue ship where he works.

Yet, Rice is excited for the possibility of a high enemy official being dead and the possibility of the war coming to an end; Sam is still jaded. \n\nLethla moves and they realize that he is not dead.  Lethla was able to survive in the void of space with the usage of a well-hidden face mask made of glassite. Lethla threatens the two to not make any moves and communicates his intent to control the ship. Rice tells Lethla to leave because it is against Interplanetary law to mess with a morgue ship. Lethla rebuffs that defense. All the while, Sam is observing the two interact. Lethla lets the two know that Kriere is still alive and is also wearing the same mask that Lethla had worn. He explains that they were attacked near Mars while they were on their way to Venus. They were running out of supplies and decided to trick the morgue ship to continue their trip to Venus. After Lethla explains why and how he got to the morgue ship, he commands them to go pick up Kriere. Sam smiles and complies with Lethla\u2019s orders. \n\nSam thinks over his options and considers getting Lethla and Kriere to Venus so that he can peacefully return to Earth. They spot Kriere in space floating as if he is dead. Sam continues thinking about his options to overpower both Kriere and Lethla and experiences some fear over the possible success of his plan. He begins to sweat nervously but becomes more confident as he puts the plan into action. Sam activates the ship\u2019s claw mechanism to pick up Kriere\u2019s body. As Lethla watches him he mentions a saying about how the ship is meant for dead men and then unexpectedly begins to crush Kriere\u2019s body with the claw, killing Kriere. Lethla is caught off guard but manages to fire his gun at Sam before Rice attacks him. Lethla screams in horror for a time while Burnett uncontrollably laughs. Rice expresses how he doesn\u2019t believe Sam should have killed Kriere. Sam argues that it didn\u2019t matter as long as it was his last trip somehow. Sam dies and becomes the 100 body on the ship, filling it and allowing the ship to return back to Earth fulfilling Sam\u2019s last desire. \n"}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "68dc832c181b4efebf338588ab1fab70", "response_text": "Sam Burnett works on the morgue ship called the Constellation.

Rice calls him over and explains that the body they just brought in is Lethla, Kriere\u2019s majordomo. Burnett is not very interested, but Rice takes this as a sign that Kriere must be somewhere near too. Rice talks about radioing for help if there is a warship, but Burnett does not care because he is tired of seeing all these bodies. Just before they can continue arguing, it turns out that Lethla is actually alive and reveals that he survived through the use of a face-moulded mask of glassite. Lethla knows they are weaponless and finds the radio, which upsets Rice because only dead men are supposed to be on their ship. Lethla reveals that Kriere is out there too, and he plans to use the morgue ship to rescue him. Rice does not move, but Burnett agrees to the request and goes up to drive the ship. He ponders his plan, thinking how cooperating with Venusians will help him and Rice survive. He also thinks about capturing Kriere and ending the war. They find Kriere floating in space, and Burnett drives the ship up to him. However, he knows that with both Lethla and Kriere on board, they have no chance of overpowering them. Burnett tells Rice to take the controls as he moves to the star-port, and he begins to feel the spot on his back where a bullet will hit him. Kriere is outside, reaching towards the Constellation and smiling. The claw lever is extended and retrieves Kriere, while Burnett tells Lethla that only dead men come aboard the ship. The claw crushes Kriere, leaving only his head preserved for identification. Lethla fires the gun that hits Burnett, but he and Rice retaliate. Soon, Lethla is dead too.

One day, Burnett and Rice collect a soldier from the void, who they identify as Lethla, the right hand man of Kriere, the head enemy. Rice is excited, noting that Lethla's death indicates an end to the war, but Burnett remains unfazed, when Lethla's body suddenly jumps to life. Lethla had faked his death after an accident in order to board the morgue ship, and he takes Burnett and Rice hostage in an effort to rescue Kriere and go to Venus. Burnett agrees while Rice hesitates; he sees this as an opportunity to catch up with the war and end the trip once and for all. The Constellation reaches Kriere, and Burnett catches Lethla off guard by crushing Kriere with the claw, killing him. Burnett and Rice then fight off Lethla, eventually killing him too.

Sam and Rice have a short argument then: Rice wants to take advantage of Kriere, the enemy's leader, being on their territory. Sam argues that they should stay away as they are not a battle-cruiser, he is tired of his job, sentimental about the young warriors and willing to go back to Earth. The dispute stops when it turns out that Lethla is alive and aims his gun. Rice is shocked - no one can live in the void, but Lethla did with the help of glassite. The intruder breaks the radio and announces the purpose of his visit: to rescue Kriere. Turns out their ship was attacked and the two escaped in the same life- boat, wearing chrysali-helmets, and headed towards the morgue ship, the only thing nearby, knowing they would be taken in and considered dead. The morgue rocket was the best cover possible to get safely to Venus, but Kriere was still in the void, while Lethla was picked up. \"Constellation\" starts searching for Kriere as Lethla orders with Sam feeling finally alive and happily agreeing. He has a plan for the two to fill the empty shelves in his morgue. Various plans on how to kill the two enemies and end the war keep appearing in Sam's head while he picks up the body.

T. HAGGERT\nIllustrated by WOOD\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Magazine August 1959.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nNothing in the world could be happier and\nmere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but\nwhat happens when it loves him back?\nKeep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve\nhas to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\nand eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\nClay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\nappointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't\nknow what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\nsent him.\"\nThe interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\nbetray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\nand studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\nlarge for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\nsightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\nhe ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\nHe turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\nthe building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\nmore ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\nordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\nThere had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\nnone at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\nthe electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\nThey jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\nas they should have been for a plant this size.\nSomething else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\nwhat it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\nchanging shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\nstreet, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to\nhandle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\nstairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\nemployees' entrance was on the third side.\nIt wasn't.\nStaring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\nhe had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\nset to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\nopened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\na soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.\nManners?\"\n\"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\"You\nare\nMr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\nHe nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\nmicrophone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down\nthe hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\nfor him.\nHe went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\ngrip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\nbefore and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\nhis calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\nPeter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\njust short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\nall the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\ninterview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to\nunnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\nHe let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\nstraightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\nfor a position should.\n\"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\nHe was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\nfront of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\nHe did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\nThe room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\na high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\nmassive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\npaintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\nflowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\ninto Hollywood's idea of an office.\nHis eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\nfor another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of\nframe supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and\ndrawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\nBut then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\nto the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\ncomplexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\nthis was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly.\nPeter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\njolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\nreply that would cost him this job.\n\"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\nhave any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\nthings like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the\nbasics\nof how\nwe live.\"\n\"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\nPeter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions\nthey're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\nout of you.\"\n\"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After\nI got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\nan electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\ncompany\u2014\"\n\"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\nPeter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.\n\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\nwith money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\ntheir products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\ncalculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\naren't you?\"\n\"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter\nadmitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\ncalculus.\"\n\"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\nengineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\nbe useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\ngetting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\nthese birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\nget a job with someone else?\"\nPeter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\nsent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\nseen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been\neasy.\"\n\"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\nprocedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\nyou'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\nscared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\nsomething you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\nout of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\nany wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\ndegree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\"\nIt made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\nthis straight all the way. He nodded.\n\"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\nbasis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\nPeter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\nbeen, yes.\"\n\"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?\nSo youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a\nhighly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this\nstockpiling outfit?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there\nis\na shortage! And the\nstockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\nhell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have\nto, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\nsolution?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Peter said.\nLexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\nWhat makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\nschool. I have, haven't I?\"\n\"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.\nRight?\"\nPeter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and\nwhether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\nLooking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,\nPeter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\"Then what am I after?\"\n\"Suppose you tell me.\"\nSo suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out\nof the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible\ntiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\nbe made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\nillusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\ncynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\nor cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\nThose were the important things. The background data I got from the\nAssociation on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\nI think you are. Am I right?\"\n\"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if\nthat answers the question.\"\n\"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\nIn precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\nat sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\nthe lack of employees' entrances.\n\"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic\ndoors. Anything else?\"\n\"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\"I'm the only one there is.\"\nPeter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\nthey all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\nproducts or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\nwater-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\ngoods.\n\"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show\nyou.\"\nThe office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\nantiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\nthe manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\ndisorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\noverhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\nof their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\nof illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\nreached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\nloading door he had seen from outside.\nLexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\nwith raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set\nof automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\nexactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\nmaterials handling machines.\"\nPeter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\nmachines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\nformation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\nThey gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\ntwo arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\nfashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\nrelaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\nLexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,\nthese machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\nplant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\na single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\nthe toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\nuseful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\nLexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\nof the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\ntugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\nand before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\nto attend to mysterious duties of their own.\nPeter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\nfrustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\nreplaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\na large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\nother materials were stored.\n\"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\nshortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the\ntrace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,\nit's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\nplant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\nmaterials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\npackage the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\nsent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\nsent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\nthe withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\npurchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\nyou through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\nthey're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\"\nPeter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\neach one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\nor carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\nsomething to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\neverywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\nexact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\ndoing it.\nHe wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\naisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\nonrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\nspeeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\nthat was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\nexit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\nwhere they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\ngo by.\nBack in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\nroom where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard\nbusiness machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\nthat room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\ntypewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\nkeyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\nthis one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\nthere's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\nbookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"\nasked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\nhad engulfed him.\n\"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\nevery week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\nThe shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\nwhen they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\nlooked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\nsagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\nsilence remain unbroken.\nFinally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run\narticles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\ntwenty years in the future.\"\n\"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\n\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\nidiotic notions about specialization.\"\nLexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\nApparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\nalthough it hadn't been strenuous.\nHe leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\nin contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\narrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\nbusiness twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\nthrough university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\ngot so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\nThey bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\ndetermined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\nabsorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\ntheory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\ntried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\none of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\nway I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\nLexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\nspoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\nbecause I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\nAfter three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\nsuppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\na strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\nwife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\nwas killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\nmade me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\nmade things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\nto spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I\nremember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\ngirl.\n\"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\nemployees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\ndesign the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\nmyself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\nwasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\nplant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\nbusiness I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\nLexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\nmulti-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\nordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\nyou, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\nand from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\nknowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\nbut I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\ncompare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\nof course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\ndrums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\nEverest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\nwork for me.\n\"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\npredetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\nin units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\nthe logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\nway they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\nelectrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\nand once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\ncompete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\ndo only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\nthe back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\nwould be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\nme free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\nnumbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\nmoney.\"\n\"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked.\nLexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\nthis plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one\nstarted working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought\nthe old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my\nassets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it\nwasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\nimpossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\ncontrol section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\na comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\nnevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\nfigured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\nthey could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\naction with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\nwould be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\nactivity that I'd already established.\"\nHere Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\nand did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\nthen I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\nsort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\nwas still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\nprime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\nonly be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\nTV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\nevery order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\npressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\nlogic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\nbutton. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\ngoing well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\nor maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\nof time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\nPretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\nof the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\ntried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\nat first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\ndiscover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\norder was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\nconvincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\nexplanation.\n\"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\ncopied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\nconsole keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\nof the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\nkeyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\nkicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure\ncenter in an animal's brain, isn't it?\"\nWhen Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\nman was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\nmight mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I\nhad altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\nme pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\nactivated.\n\"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\nwas learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\ncould watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\nto increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\nrewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\nit for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\nalmost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\nAt this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\nsilently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\nhad taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\nThen the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How\ndo you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\nPeter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\nreplied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\nA square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\nin an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\nrose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\non it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\ndo, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\nstopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\nLexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\nabout something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\noffice, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\nPeter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\nornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\nbe matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\ntime, the gold leaf comes off!\"\nPeter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\nso he kept silent.\nLexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\nhe continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\ndidn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\nproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\nI hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\nalso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\nmachine couldn't fix for itself.\"\nHandling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\na gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\nword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\nIt was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\nvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\nreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\nsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\nYou might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\nthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\nwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\nbut how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\nthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\nmachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\nI threw might be imitated.\"\n\"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\ndo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\nwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that\nthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\ncontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\nsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\nobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\nout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\nstiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\ncould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\nelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\nand to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\nnothing to do.\"\n\"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\nsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\na long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\nand a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\nI went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\never sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\nseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX\nINDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM\nPLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE\nPLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY\nUSED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

L. HALEY\nThere's a place for every man and a man for\nevery place, but on robot-harried Mars the\nsituation was just a little different.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nHarper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed\ntwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He\nclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner\nfrom jumping.\n\"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and\nlet go of everything.\"\nHarper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And\ngently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated\ntenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\nFor all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge\nhe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously\nstationary sofa.\n\"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.\nFranz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a\ntrial?\"\nHarper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That\nprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for\nweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like\na four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling\nbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely\noutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you\nlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run\nthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's\ncausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd\ncrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\nHarper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n\"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook\nafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged\nman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving\nme to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,\nreasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the\nidiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the\nnew colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.\n\"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk\ntwenty years ago?\"\nHarper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he\nrasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells\nspewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\"\nScribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain\nwere the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and\nscheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's\nnervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere\nwith the harmony of his home.\n\"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know\nthat those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs\never discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built\nthe largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that\npeople are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,\nyou missed a bet!\"\nLeaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from\nScribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped\nstructure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock\nof Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular\nskyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,\nother domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the\ndrawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went\ntwo years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came\nback in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\nDutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian\nsprings had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,\nHarp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas\nthey use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of\nfloats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And\nyou can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not\nonly that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking\nbrother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an\nenzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil\ninto its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a\nfortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns\nto process the stuff!\"\nScribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The\nmagazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and\ncalculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he\nacknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\nRaising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that\nwas when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed\nentirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that\npoint? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll\ndisfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing\nabout it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,\nwhy don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a\ntantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out\nfor myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual\nlope.\n\"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn\nthat happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\"\nThe trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the\nsoporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the\nfirst time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy\nlethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the\ninterval.\nIt seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping\nthemselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper\nwas waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of\nthe hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by\npneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\nAppreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,\ngreen-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian\ncopper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a\ndozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\nHe could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high\nstate of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without\nhis knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,\nhe watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in\nwheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial\nduties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\nHarper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the\nexpense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and\nproneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained\noffice staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities\nof these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into\nthe field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly\nhe went over to the desk.\nHe was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy\nthat was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.\nWonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the\ndesk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a\nrobot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the\nstress of the argument.\n\"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what\nyou charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want\none! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you\nhear?\"\nNo one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.\nThe clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know\nthe hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,\nreally, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.\nAdmit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he\nsmiled at the enraged woman.\n\"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is\ntoo\ngood.\nI might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want\nsomeone to\nhear\nwhat I say! I want to be able to change my mind once\nin awhile!\"\nHarper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone\nshe can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he\nstepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,\nplease.\" He turned back to the woman.\nBut she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil\nenough to wait your turn!\"\nHarper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,\nare always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a\nnormal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned\nauthoritatively to the clerk.\n\"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a\nrest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing\nyour\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\nThe clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was\nHarper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's\nimplacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his\nforehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to\ndeposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow\nand another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the\nknees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist\nbanged the counter.\nThe clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.\nAbsently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the\nirate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a\npallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a\nsilent and efficient robot.\nThe room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear\nwindows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of\nthe Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were\nbusy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and\nhis associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how\nto extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid\nand almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;\nmere details....\nLeaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up\nto the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with\nconsomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue\nsky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase\nwhile Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.\nLeaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim\ncigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney\nhad certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the\nbell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of\nwell-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\nHarper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that\nthey were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no\nfurther opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated\nmovements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo\ninto his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him\nout.\nHarper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.\n\"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\nHe struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.\nInexorably it pushed him flat.\n\"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo\nbegan to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as\nhe drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,\nat that.\nThere was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper\nbleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for\nthe opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the\ndesk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots\naround here, have you?\"\nHarper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what\nthey did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here\nwhile I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed\nin months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The\nonly meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his\nfist and contemplated the outrage.\n\"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with\nthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You\ntry it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I\nhad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready\nto staff my offices with the things!\"\nThe big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and\ngroaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use\nsome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I\nate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You\nmean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm\nsuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's\nEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth\nmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.\nFactory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they\ncould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in\nfact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,\nhe's about out of business.\"\nHarper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.\nBut just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a\nhorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third\nrobot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing\nwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!\nTake it away!\"\nThe robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and\nruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither\nbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his\nebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\nThe robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to\nJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take\nme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the\ntreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\nStolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped\nhim down and marched out with him.\nDejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver\nof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,\nmechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.\nThere was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.\nSomething that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it\nout.\nFor five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that\nmade him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,\nsince he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking\nmud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he\nwas sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he\ngagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then\nstood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and\nexercised him.\nWhenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.\nThere was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the\nphone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two\nweeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned\nhis back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look\nflesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become\naccustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for\nhours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an\nappetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they\nsent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he\ncould wake up enough to be.\nHe hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,\nstill moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily\ninformed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.\nAfter I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't\nfind any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the\nelevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a\nman or he's stuck.\"\n\"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait\nany longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been\nthinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when\nthat assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled\nand gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room\nand I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what\nhappens?\"\n\"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll\nget my clothes.\"\nHarp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\nHarp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?\nI'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have\nto go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\nJake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe\nyou could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's\nokay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in\nthat fancy lobby.\"\nHarper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots\nwill be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm\nsure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't\nworry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\nHarper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room\nhe watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for\nhis first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's\nclothing.\nThe result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's\nclothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking\nup on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was\nshoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number\ntwelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from\nhis image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.\n\"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for\nme. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\nHe'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the\nrobot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to\nthe elevator.\nOnly the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge\nsuave lobby.\nHe was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the\nother visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the\nelevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island\nin a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the\noversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots\nshared his self control.\nThe clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.\nFrantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.\nWith a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving\ninexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he\nordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he\ncircled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things\nat the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.\nEspecially, card indexes.\n\"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get\nit straight again! Stop it!\"\n\"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your\nswitchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\nWith one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an\nelectric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became\noddly inanimate.\n\"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the\ncollar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across\nthe width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond\nspeech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and\nreturned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at\nthe same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\nBrushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper\nflapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who\nwas busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal\ndesk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good\nman\u2014\" he began.\n\"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the\nmanager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could\nstretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper\nS. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I\nhaven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way\ndownstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?\nBecause that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those\ndamnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,\nHarper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a\nsheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\nHayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic\npattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.\nWith a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \"\nMy\nrobots!\" he muttered.\n\"As if I invented the damned things!\"\nDespondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you\ndon't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,\nat the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my\nresignation.\"\nAgain he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool\nrobots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix\nthe two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with\nrobots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.\nWe\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.\nAnd it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.\nSo\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\nListening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he\nhooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and\nreached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I\ndon't know,\" he said mildly.\nHayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What\ndo you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,\naren't you?\"\nMeticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that\nthese robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even\nmake a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a\nreasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at\nyour establishment.\"\nHayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots\nafter what you've seen and experienced?\"\nPlacidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take\ninto consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And\nthere's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm\nwilling to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\nWith hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his\nhead. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll\nback you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.\nBreen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of\nthe hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny\nhand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but\nacross the lobby to the elevator.\nHarper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the\ntreatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders\ninside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready\nfor the second step of his private Operation Robot.\nBack on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown\nto the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,\nwaited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered\nfrom deceleration.\n\"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally\nopening.\"\nThey watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They\nwatched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,\nit's amazing! Look at him!\nAnd indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit\nand years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the\nfirst pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it\nagain!\"\nHarper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out\nHagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got\nboth of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they\ndidn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit\nfor that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to\nyou. All right?\"\n\"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human\nafter all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of\nthose robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\nHarper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.\n\"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for\nweeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they\nbelong!\"\nHe glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,\nwaiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He\nturned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of\nstock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,\nhoney?\"\n\"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left\nthe port.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "106", "uid": "e771011d17e94e22b8f860305f70a41c", "response_text": "Harper Breen is exhausted.

SMITH\nIllustrated by DILLON\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSnaddra had but one choice in its fight\nto afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly\npretend theirs was an aboveboard society!\n\"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.\n\"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru\nprotested.\n\"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she\nexclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem\nto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.\nIt's forever.\"\n\"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to\nkeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\nBbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way\nLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when\nshe said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and\napprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other\nagain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you\nmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\nSkkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.\n\"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\nThere was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere\nregret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had\nalways felt about the girl.\n\"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.\nThis is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are\nadopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on\nliving at all.\"\n\"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but\nthe welfare of our planet comes first.\"\nShe had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the\nlibrary, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran\ninfluence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\nNo longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple\nsomersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she\nthe high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n\"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this\nbefore, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed\nby impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could\ncarry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\nBbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses\nwere not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra\nwas now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.\nHowever, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he\nwas forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the\nsmooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high\npriest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here\nqualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in\nthese arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have\nthe right to question them.\"\n\"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,\nwhirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages\nwhich were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of\nthis planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to\nutilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of\nall and now\u2014\"\n\"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break\nup things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some\ntime.\"\nSkkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke\nhim into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of\nthe chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and\nBbulas had been thoroughly terranized.\nI hate Terrestrials\n, Skkiru said to himself.\nI hate Terra.\nThe\nquiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling\nin his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were\nto break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final\nhumiliation.\n\"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her\nfiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused\nall such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the\nplanet, had received her education at the local university. Although\nsound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor\nin the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had\nsome sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are\nbehaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a\npatience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no\nidea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It\nis, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\"\nHe adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished\nfour-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber.\nKismet\n, Skkiru muttered to himself,\nand a little sleight of hand.\nBut he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of\nSnaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I\nsuppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the\nground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n\"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh,\npooh\n, POOH!\"\nLarhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at\nSkkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have\nanother drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\"But I can't work metal!\"\n\"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other\noutcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a\ntrade.\"\n\"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd\nbetter give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering\nbauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any\nlonger, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru\nyelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not\nthink I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.\nAre there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if\nyou keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a\ntrait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly\nwith the high priestess's robes.\"\nLarhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart\nfrom mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,\neven though my heart will be breaking.\"\nIt was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the\nwhole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's\nproblem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered\ndown from overhead. It was too late.\n\"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.\n\"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\nExcept the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had\nmade him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\"Hurry up, Skkiru.\"\nBbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already\ngilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked\npretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his\nown appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight\nromantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most\nhardened sadist.\n\"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of\nthe city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was\nwrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\nThat was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it\nanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate\nhis mind that school-days were long since over.\n\"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like\nthe Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected\nweariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;\nit is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the\nother\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty\nchoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they\nwant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look\nhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart\nin a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed\nto indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain\nessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than\nin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial\ninfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been\nsuch a nice girl, too.\n\"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a\nlong, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering\ntoes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and\nI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with\nBbulas.\"\n\"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the\nfield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal\nhabits and customs, and I'll even\nbeg\n. But I don't have to like doing\nit, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\nAll three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,\nSkkiru,\" she said brokenly.\nBbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a\ntriple silence.\n\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans\ndescended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a\nprocession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,\nand singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less\ninspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just\nin case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a\nsmattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to\nnavigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.\nHis teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been\ncustom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,\nof course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and\nthe wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the\ndemolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the\nplanet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when\ntaking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,\nhaving previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and\nself-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently\nprimitive.\nThe outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly\nin the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter\nseason. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals\nworn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much\ngood, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the\nprivileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their\ncostumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case\nof the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be\nhumanoid.\nAs the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once\ngotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had\nalways planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the\nweather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more\ncomfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure\nhours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which\nhe'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the\nmatter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,\nand get it.\nBbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in\nhis toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land\ntransport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked\nso well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the\nEarth ship long before the official greeters had reached it.\nThe newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly\npasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae\ndistinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much\nas the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\nIn fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,\nentirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow\nexpected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had\nfrequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those\ncould be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had\nalways understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving\nbeyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which\nthe Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to\nunderstand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable\nthird language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen\none since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on\nthat little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,\nthat's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more\nthan a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to\namass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried\nto eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully\nthat it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How\nhorrible!\"\n\"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another\nspecies entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it\nwas quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral\nconsiderations seemed less important to us than self-preservation\njust then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the\nmissionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,\nwell, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with\na polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming\nprocession\u2014\ncreatures indeed\n! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.\n\"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would\nbe indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially\nsince this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the\nshoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\nEither he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of\nBbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which\nhad always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent\nlife-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it\nwasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with\nan appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the\nprocessional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some\nslight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three\neyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my\nfavorite color.\"\nIf they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn\nbright yellow.\nHis own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal\nhealthy emerald to a sickly celadon.\nCyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion\nof his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere.\nMaybe the\nlittle one's a robot!\nHowever, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better\nconstructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport\nwith the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\nCyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap\nsomething for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of\nexchange here?\"\nMoney\n, Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this\npiece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.\n\"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be\na universal one.\"\n\"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\nSkkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs\nof gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the\nplanet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate\nwere to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift\nto contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his\nrocker.\nTo make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,\nSkkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's\nresistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much\nweather all at once.\nOn Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they\noften sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem\nof birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed\nno such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was\ndwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the\nchocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than\nto descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival.\nBeing a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,\nmomentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.\nFor one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously\nupon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle\naffair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the\nofficial reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,\nbecause of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from\novershooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at\nhim\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both\nsides, too.\nNonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no\nmatter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he\nwasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand\nsegregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic\nthought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars\nwere often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since\nmetal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the\nplanet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the\neasy way out.\nSkkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high\npriest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were\nvolcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the\nwind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the\nsnug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were\nmetal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially\nvisible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the\nplanet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the\nSnaddrath depended upon imports.\nAs the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas\nat the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although\nSkkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made\nthe emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing\nthere, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers\nwelcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by\nBbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,\nfor there was no end to the man's conceit.\nThe difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable\nrags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf\nthat had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short\nlife, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so\nlovely and so remote.\n\"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was\nsaying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our\nhearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and\nwith love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here\nas you did on Nemeth....\"\nCyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in\ncontemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much\nattention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of\nthe Galaxy.\"\nShe had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we\nwere honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and\nwe are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\nThe crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,\napparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and\nprofit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive\nanalysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study\nyour society, not to tamper with it in any way.\"\nHa, ha\n, Skkiru said to himself.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of\nthe corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've\nestablished rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\nBbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts\nto feel sorry for the man.\n\"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with\ngreat self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small\nbut unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We\nhope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the\nthroat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,\nbut the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he\nadded hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not\nattractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,\nsuch aroma!\"\nCyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing\nas mud....\"\nThe smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable\nTerrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a\ndance to bring on rain. It is a dance to\nstop\nrain.\"\nHe was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,\nthat was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.\nIn the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for\nthe improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than\nthis high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned\nthe various roles so that each person would be making a definite\ncontribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,\nlike the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\nWhat kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing\naround begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?\nOnly the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw\nthemselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried\naway that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been\naccustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.\nUnfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled\nhim both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been\nso drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.\nIt gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,\nalthough, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have\nto arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's\npatriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die\nfor his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the\nresult of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\nAll the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off\nto the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for\none of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist\nmiserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The\ncapital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow\nsuit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep\nthe Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\nHe could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of\nthem, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing\nthe game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\nAs if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which\nstruck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed\nto help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that\nthemselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put\nout centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired\nfrom a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far\ntoo high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and\nmuch more cheaply.\nIt wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had\nbeen forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.\nWhat resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from\nminerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All\nlife-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and\nrice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a\nTerran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the\nother planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of\nthe direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist\nbusiness.\nSomething definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay\naltogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.\nThe traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service\njob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to\nthe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general\ngloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring\nsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,\nwas where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test\nwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\nThe winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran\nLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No\nindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how\ngreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so\nimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason\nwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at\nthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the\npopulation.\nThe Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve\nthe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former\nPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the\nfact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,\nafter considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method\nof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,\nhad come up with this program.\nIt was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he\nfelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the\nBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,\nlargely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,\nas a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the\nstatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of\nthe planet, there was no choice.\nBut all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his\nanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one\nprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was\nnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies\nwhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in\nlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive\nsociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru\nshould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy\nof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran\nprimitive tradition of romance.\n\"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were\nout of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are\nthose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\nSkkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some\nold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of\ncollecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\nBbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think.

Smith details the tale of a race on the brink of extinction and their strange attempt to save themselves. Snaddra is a rainy planet with a mud surface. Due to the harsh weather, the Snaddrath chose to build their cities underground. Their civilized culture allowed for excellence in the metal industry and architecture, however, their isolation caused for poor education and expensive trade deals. In the face of crisis, the Bbulas Plan emerged, a plot to move their capital aboveground to convince visiting Terrans of their primitive nature and need for help. \nIt begins with Skirru, an architect-turned-beggar, arguing with his former fiance, Larhgan, who is now the High Priestess. Their new jobs forbid marriage between the two, so Larhgan returns his grimpatch with regret. Bbulas, the new High Priest, watches gleefully, as he was in love with Larhgan all along. After much fighting, they levitate to the surface of the planet and wait for the Terrans to arrive. Now covered with huts, the new caste system emerges. Skirru is upset about his current position and feels ill. The woven metal clothes he was given to wear did not shield him from the light, so his green skin starts fading to yellow. \nThe Terrans arrive, Raoul and Cyril, to analyze the planet. Skirru begs in front of them, and they give him a chocolate bar, a delicacy on Snaddra. He eats it quickly, grateful for the treat as it restores health to sick Snaddrath. He remembers a pair of shoes he once got and dashes belowground to get them, returning with booted feet. Able to walk easier now, he follows the Terrans to the temple, where Bbulas and Larhgan are waiting. \nRaoul eyes the female Snaddrath hungrily. Cyril reminds him that they are there to investigate, not fraternize with the natives. Once there, Larhgan welcomes them with a long speech Bbulas wrote. Bbulas invites the Terrans to a rain dance, which they laugh at seeing as the planet is covered in mud. Bbulas recovers quickly and claims it\u2019s a ceremony to stop the rain. Already, his plot to save his planet is falling apart. Raoul quickly notices that the beggar, Skkiru, is wearing mudshoes, which makes no sense. \nBbulas changes the subject and points them towards their hut, evidently the nicest one on Snaddra.

The interest of the Terrans is extremely important because the planet\u2019s population and natural resources are wasting away; they need the attention and resources that an anthropological study can provide. Bbulas, the Planetary Diletantte went to a Terran university on another planet after being selected for his highest intelligence score in the group tested with him. As Diletantte, he has been called upon to help solve the planet\u2019s dilemma of saving itself. His plan, accepted because there were no better plans, involves restructuring the society and culture of the planet into one that he says the Terran anthropologists will find more intriguing than their real culture. He explains that this is because Terrans are most interested in societies that are different from their own, rather than like their own as Snaddrath really society is. He uses lots to assign roles in the society and ends up as the high priest, and the high priestess is Larhgan, a female he has been interested in for a long time but who was engaged to Skkiru. Skkiru has drawn the lot of a beggar and can no longer be engaged to Larhgan, and at the beginning of the story, he finds out that the changes Bbulas has instituted are actually going to be permanent. Bbulas threatens to make Skkiru a metal worker, the lowest position in the social hierarchy, if he doesn\u2019t cooperate. Larhgan is sad that she will not be able to marry Skkiru and says she will not marry anyone at all but just devote her life to religion. \n\tWhen the Earth ship arrives with the Terrans, everyone goes to the surface to welcome them even though it is cold and raining. There is a reminder for everyone except beggars to wear shoes. They hold a welcoming ceremony, and the Terrans notice Skkiru, the beggar, so he begs from them. They aren\u2019t sure what to give him, so they give him chocolate which is a real treat because Bbulas has closed all the chocolate shops. One Terran, Raoul, notices how beautiful Larhgan is, and the other, Cyril, reminds him they cannot establish friendships with the native females because it would prevent them from being objective. The Terrans thank the Shadds for their welcome and tell them they hope their stay will be pleasant and profitable. They intend to study the Shadds without doing anything to disturb their culture.\n\tThe Shadds desperately need the Terrans\u2019 interest. The Shadds\u2019 natural resources are nearly depleted, and their population is decreasing. The culture is getting close to being unsustainable.

Bbulas has given out roles to each citizen of Snaddra, and the entire planet is depending on the scheme. Two anthropologists from Terran (Earth) have been invited to research the fake society in hopes that their attention will bring good fortune.

Skkiru had been engaged to Larhgan, who would now serve as high priestess, but this difference in social status meant they could no longer be affiliated. They discuss some of the confusion and issues surrounding the plan, and all head outside when they hear the announcement that the Earthmen had arrived. It turned out that the Snaddrath lived in underground cities, but built some buildings above-ground where they would convince the Earthmen they actually lived. When they got to the surface, they saw the procession greeting the visitors, and started trying to navigate the huge amounts of mud on the surface. The Snaddrath could self-levitate, but didn't want to give this ability away so they made slow progress walking. Skkiru ran off to find his mud-shoes, and met everyone else at the ship. The Earthmen (the cultural ruling race) were talking about previous situations on other planets, not knowing that the Snaddrath could actually understand them. They offer Skkiru some chocolate, which he takes (it increases the body's resistance to weather, and was a delicacy). As this continues, Skkiru reflected on the rapid loss of population and resources on the planet and how the Terran visit has affected his planet. For instance, metal-working was the largest industry, so Bbulas made them the lowest caste when reorganizing the society, which Skkiru thought was an easy way out of a chance to be more creative. Eventually interacting with Larhgan, the Terrans express gratitude for the welcome they have received and expresses interest in learning from the Snaddrath, enjoying their stay, and to not affect the society as much as possible. Skkiru found humor in this, as the presence of the Earthmen is the only reason their society is structured the way it is currently. The Terrans are invited to a raindance, which confuses them, until Bbulas catches himself and says it's to stop the rain, not to get more. Skkiru continued to reflect: he hadn\u2019t been able to live well and to save, so he didn't have savings. He was willing to play this game to avoid discovery of the truth by the Earthmen, with the careful systems of tabus to keep the visitors from discovering the underground cities, in part because he didn't want to leave Larhgan.

Instead of being thankful for their hardest and most important workers, they treat them very poorly. \n\nWhen Raoul offers Skkiru a chocolate bar, he happily accepts the gift. This is because chocolate is only available in very expensive shops, and Skkiru has had very few opportunities to taste the delicacy. \n\nThe surface of Snaddra is virtually untouched because all of society lives in underground cities. When the citizens embark on their new mission to convince the Terran that they live primitive lives on the surface, they are wholly unprepared to deal with the rainy and windy weather. The nonstop precipitation means that everyone is standing in mud, and their costumes do not adequately protect them from the harsh conditions. \n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "d1c82b4035d34c2599b020ba887772d0", "response_text": "Snaddra is a muddy and rainy planet with limited natural resources, and a race of people who live in underground cities. There is so much mud that neither the Terrans nor the Snaddrath can move very quickly on the surface. The depleting resources of the planet means that there are only a few things that can grow on the surface, rice and fish. Rice is itself an import from Earth, and a lot of resources are acquired through trade.

This Terran League University was far too expensive for any Snaddrath to afford, not only due to tuition costs. The travel expenses alone were outrageous. And so, only one student per generation would receive funds to attend. Since Bbulas was schooled there, he has more Terran tendencies than his brethren, such as his ability to not show emotions or keep from whirling when upset. \nAfter attending university, he was selected to work as the Planetary Dilettante. This selection process involves testing Snaddrath in a variety of subjects. Evidently, Bbulas\u2019 scores were the highest, so when President Luccar declared a state of emergency, he chose Bbulas to fix the situation at hand. \nBbulas designed the Bbulas Plan to solve Snaddra\u2019s economic downfall. His ultimate goal was to entice Terrans to come to Snaddra and support the planet with foreign trade. In order to do so, he decided to completely redesign their entire culture and move their capital aboveground. Bbulas believes that Terrans will be more likely to help if Snaddra is primitive in nature. \nThe story begins with an argument between Skkiru, Larhgan, and Bbulas. Bbulas elected himself High Priest in the new world, and the lots elected Larhgan to be the High Priestess. Skkiru, her fiance, was to be a beggar, sot hey could no longer be together, much to Bbulas\u2019 delight. \nAfter passively threatening Skkiru, the three rise to the surface and ready themselves for the Terrans\u2019 arrival. \nBbulas welcomes the Terrans at the temple and invites them to a stop-the-rain ceremony. He sends the Terrans to their hut and then becomes upset at Skkiru for wearing mud shoes when he is supposed to be a beggar. \n"}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "967c41320d6b4b8e8235818f8b182c8b", "response_text": "Bbulas is the Planetary Diletantte who has just overhauled the Snaddran society in preparation for the Terrans\u2019 study. He has done away with the president and parliament, replacing them with himself as high priest and a female high priestess. He has created elaborate rules and a new social hierarchy with all the roles assigned by lots, although some Snadds doubt the fairness of the lot-drawing. He has also made the Snadds move from underground to above ground even though the surface of the planet is covered with thick mud from the constant rain. Bbulas considers himself superior due to his education and thinks he is talented in multiple ways, including speechwriting and even building shelters. He anticipated the Terrans\u2019 interests and makes sure the females are scantily clad and rewrites the words to their popular songs to make them less suggestive in case the Terrans have learned any Snadd. The majority of the Snaddrath voted to adopt Bbulas\u2019s plan because no one else had come up with a better one. \n"}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "b77eb6c7abdf47d6916fc2d0274fab91", "response_text": "Bbulas is a pompous and conceited man, and he fancies himself very important.

Not a single citizen can afford the expenses associated with interplanetary travel, so Bbulas\u2019s opportunity is looked at as once-in-a-lifetime. \n\nBbulas takes advantage of his position as an elite. Although he claims that in the program he created, each individual\u2019s position was selected randomly, he openly acknowledges that he was the only person who could possibly pose as the high priest. When Skkiru complains about having to pose as a beggar when he was once a successful architect, Bbulas immediately threatens to turn him into a metal-worker, a member of the lowest caste system, instead. He is completely unconcerned about the breakup of Skkiru and Lahgran\u2019s relationship and simply reminds Skkiru that he must make sacrifices for the good of the planet. Skkiru knows that Bbulas has had his eyes on his fiance for quite some time, so it\u2019s no surprise that Bbulas have given her a role where he will get to spend loads of time with her. \n\nSkkiru definitely doesn\u2019t approve of Bbulas as the Planetary Dilettante and believes he passed the examination because the exam itself was deeply flawed.

He has a particular role in the society as the Planetary Dilettante, which means he is the one person in his generation who was afforded an off-world education where he could learn from the Terran style system, which focuses more on emotional regulation than the native training. He was educated on Gambrell, a nearby planet which has a Terran League University. The government can only afford to send one person per generation to receive this kind of schooling so it is considered a high honor. The Dilettante is the one on standby for when there are emergencies, and the President decided that the arrival of the Earthmen was such an emergency. In order to prepare for the arrival of the Terrans, he set up everything necessary to fool the Terrans into thinking the Snaddrath were more primitive than they actually were. He was the one who restructured society so that the metal workers were the lower class, as they were the most populous group of people, and assigned Skkiru the role of a beggar which forced him to break off his engagement with Larhgan as she was assigned the high priestess role. This is especially angering to Skkiru because Bbulas assigned himself the high priest role. Skkiru is frustrated with Bbulas for making him a beggar and also disappointed because he thinks he could have been more creative in his set-up of a new society, especially being as intelligent as he was. He used blueprints from a Terrestrial magazine to build some of the above-ground features, instead of designing his own, for instance. At the beginning of the story, he is bickering with Skkiru about the fact that Skkiru is now a beggar, and all of the issues that come for Skkiru with that. He eventually led Skkiru and Larhgan to the surface of the planet when they received notice that the Earthmen had arrived, and focused on greeting these visitors. After a procession is completed, at the end of this excerpt of the story, he is yelling at Skkiru in an attempt to show his power over him, insisting that Skkiru not think for himself and just abide by the guidelines Bbulas puts forth. \n"}]}]}

GUNN\nIllustrated by ASHMAN\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nThis little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could\nhe\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?\nThe flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the\nold, orange sun.\nIt was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The\nflivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat\ncylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been\nslapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,\nfully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\nAs it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,\nat the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\nA moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass\nand knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that\nmade the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver\nrocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\nThen all was quiet\u2014outside.\nInside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the\nair. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing\npractically whipped, too!\"\nGrampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round\nor two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of\nlapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once\ncalled Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had\nbegun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\"\nJunior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable\nof exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult\nreflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his\nknees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,\nFred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter\nless than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as\nEarth.\"\nGrampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from\nthe navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,\nJunior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data\ninto Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that\nthe second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,\n'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\nThose were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking\nremarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled\nuntil Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'\nIt sounds disrespectful.\"\nReba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a\nred-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That\nJunior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever\nnoticed about the boy.\n\"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred\nis Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\"That's different,\" Reba said.\nGrampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The\npircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender\nopenings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing\nmade me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother\nand Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but\nsomehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure\nhe did the best he could.\"\n\"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,\n\"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,\nJunior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the\ncurving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred\nyears ago.\"\n\"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work\nto do.\"\nGrampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last\nbutton on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to\ndo, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth\nshare.\"\n\"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money\nbought it?\"\n\"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space\nflivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the\nrest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and\nlongevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to\ngo searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly\ngalaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be\nsorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just\nbefore we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that\nLife-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?\nWell, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a\nbutton. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\nFour stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the\ncomputer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from\nEarth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\nGrampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense\nconcentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,\ntaking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player\nwho makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is\nto\u2014\"\n\"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask\nfor it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted\nindignantly.\nFour shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.\nWithin it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the\npicture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland\nand plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the\nflivver's stern.\n\"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has\nfauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per\ncent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms\nviable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone\nalready. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.\n\"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should\nhave friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\nBut Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart\nroom. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,\nhe asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You\nsee, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer\nquit.\"\n\"Quit!\"\n\"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it\nwon't budge!\"\nThe thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry\ngelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.\nIt opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?\nFweep?\"\nJoyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her\nface. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\"\n\"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand\nimpatiently. \"Get it out!\"\nFour's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with\naliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't\nlike to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\nJoyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes\nme sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly\nat Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept\ngrandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that\nopened out from it.\n\"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\nSwiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a\nnarrow path of sparkling clean tile.\nGrampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely\nclosed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"\nhe said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never\nhad the nerve.\"\n\"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior\nwould have had competition!\"\n\"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned\nover confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever\nmarried a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\nReba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw\nsomething in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been\nsubmerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you\nand to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I\nthought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\"\nGrampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring\nintently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said\nabsently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then\nslowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building\nme a pircuit?\"\n\"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the\nprinciple. The player who moved second could always win if he used the\nright strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of\nfour each\u2014\"\n\"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing\nthe other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\nGrampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\nInside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible\nfree-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"\nhe said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he\nlifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he\nsighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put\nthe bottle away.\n\"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely\nbrides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger\nrowboat?\"\n\"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\nFour thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three\nmissionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one\nof the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had\npaused at Grampa's feet.\nGrampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared\ninto Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path\nseemed crooked.\nIts gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said.\nAs if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously\ntoward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the\npolarizer turned on.\"\nThe airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,\nfollowed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,\nscintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at\nonce. Joyce!\"\nThe door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was\nregal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:\n\"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a\nfew low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\nJunior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is\nas good as anybody's.\"\n\"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.\nShe turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy\nrich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like\nbillionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this\ncramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She\nglared venomously at Grampa.\n\"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As\nreal estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the\nend of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our\nlives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\nJoyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either\nit's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that\njust won't polarize.\"\n\"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were\nany good.\"\nThe land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and\nrose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable\nspaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that\nthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\nGrampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I\nwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.\nIf\nwe get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.\nAll over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the\npolarizer will polarize it.\"\n\"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it\nisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\nGrampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a\nfew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know\nthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water\nrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,\nanyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle\nof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?\nBefore we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more\nabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\nGrampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't\nbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept\nwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,\nwhat's the theory behind polarization?\"\nGrampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the\njeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know\nhow light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"\nHe cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light\nthe vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When\nlight is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or\nrefraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are\nstill perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles\nor ellipses.\"\nThe faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of\nmatter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle\naround itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of\nspaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity\ninto a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue\naccelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\nThe faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no\nlonger. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.\nHe's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.\nHe doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe\nI didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the\nscientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the\nblamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near\nas I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else\nworry over 'why.'\"\n\"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.\n\"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool\nperpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any\nmoron would know they were impossible.\"\nGrampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity\npolarizer before I invented it.\"\n\"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with\nsome coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,\ndragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out\nnear the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound\nit.\"\n\"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded\nironically.\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\"\n\"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can\ndo is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we\nlook at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.\nEarth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's\nthe resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By\nthen, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here\nwe won't have to stop with one child.

Behind Four, like a round,\nraspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\"Not now,\" said Four.\n\"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate\nits center of gravity.\"\n\"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\"It shifts.\"\n\"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following\nme.\"\n\"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear\npolarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet\nso heavy. He's why we can't leave.\"\nThe land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered\nthe nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,\nFour,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes\nover a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing\ncannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making\nthe grand tour of the cabin.\nThe raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,\nabsorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\nJoyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no\nenzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use\nwhat he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\nJunior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the\npickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum\nrose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\nJunior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not\nmuch, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few\ndeposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said\nunbelievingly.\nFour nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for\nskin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several\nfeet of lead.\"\nFred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough\nenriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it\nmight be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the\nthought.\nJoyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do\nsomething with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here\nat the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what\nhe's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends\nthe space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't\nknow. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the\nflivver won't move.\"\n\"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it\nstopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,\nwe'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and\nyou can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so\nyou can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'\neverything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.\nRight now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower\nhis radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.\nEither way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around\nand wait for that thing to die?\"\n\"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his\nkind on this planet.\"\n\"Well?\"\n\"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.\nReproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal\ncreatures.\"\n\"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or\nsomething. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger\nthan when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"\nFred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its\nwater, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\"\nReba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,\nanyway.\"\n\"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by\nmaking us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go\nimmediately\n!\"\nFred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!\nAnd if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making\nhim do it!\"\nJoyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,\nshocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\nGrampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to\nFred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\nFred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he\nmuttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\nFred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room\ncame the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like\nsome reedy folk music.\n\"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.\n\"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a\nFweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity\nin circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the\npolarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep\nus from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or\nwhere it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like\nlinear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's\nwhen we dropped.\"\n\"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.\n\"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the\ncabin for dust and lint?\"\n\"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's\nlonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,\nexcitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\nBehind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to\nit, I mean?\"\n\"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well? What did it say?\"\n\"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\nAt the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into\nFour's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.\n\"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no\nproblem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\nIn a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite\na sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually\nmean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to\nsuggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently.\nThe land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in\nfront of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard\nswearing in a steady monotone.\n\"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\nJunior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing\nwon't work.\"\n\"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't\nexpect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,\nit would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.\nFour is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.\nIt's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this\nplanet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\nGrampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,\nI apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you\ngot the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\nJunior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his\nhand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer\ncan work on.\"\n\"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with\nthis problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's\na simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about\nthe cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because\nFweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work\nbecause he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,\nand he don't want Four to leave him.\n\"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't\nunderstand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's\ngot Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor\nto Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we\nain't gonna do.\n\"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use\nmaking a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer\nwith the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've\nalready solved the problem.

But he invested much of his earnings in perpetual motion machines and longevity pills. Now, the Peppergrass family travels to different planets, searching for radioactive metals that they can exploit to make themselves a fortune. The family consists of four generations of men and their spouses. Apparently, Grandpa, who is 90-years-old, is a widower. His son, Fred, is 60 and married to Joyce. Their son Junior, 35, is married to Reba; they are parents of an eight-year-old genius son known as Four.\n\tThe flivver they travel in was purchased by Grampa, who gave \u2159 ownership to each of the family members. The flivver\u2019s landing is unusually bumpy because the gravity polarizer failed. Through the view screen, they see that the planet has meadows, woodlands, plains, and lakes, and Four announces that it also has fauna before he rushes out the air lock to check it out. The ship has already ascertained that the air is almost like that on Earth, and there are no micro-organisms. When Four returns to the flivver accompanied by the native fauna, Fweep, he announces they are friends. The creature looks like a transparent blob and likes to sweep. Four is curious about what Fweep does with the sweepings since the outer inch or so of his body turns cloudy but clears afterward. \n\tAfter Fred and Junior use their scintillation counters to search for heavy metals, they return to the flivver to report there aren\u2019t any, just low-grade iron. The group mulls over what could be making the planet so heavy if it doesn\u2019t have heavy metals, but no one has the answer. \nJunior and Fred tell the rest of the family that the gravity polarizer isn\u2019t working and that without it, they will not be able to lift off. Reba looks on the bright side and says they can have more children instead of stopping at one child, as is currently the dictated number on Earth. In the meantime, Four returns from an excursion searching for the center of gravity for the planet and announces that it changes because of Fweep\u2019s presence. The little guy is a circular polarizer, making the planet heavy and preventing their gravity polarizer from working. Fweep is also radioactive and has impervious skin. Joyce is furious that Fweep is making them stay there, and when Grampa jokingly, or as a test, suggests leaving Four behind with Fweep, she immediately goes along with it. Four offers to stay behind with Fweep, who is lonely and likes having a friend so much it doesn\u2019t want to lose Four. Grampa announces that the problem isn\u2019t one that their computer can solve; instead, it\u2019s a logic problem like the ones Four told him earlier.   \n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "15aade80ad164151be0557954a2f30a0", "response_text": "A small, weird spaceship crashes into a meadow with four generations of the Peppergrass family inside. The men are Grampa, (Young) Fred, Junior, and Four. There are two women: Four's mom Reba, and Junior's mom Joyce. There is bickering, as Joyce doesn't think Grampa has spent his money well, and they argue about the role of gravity in their crash, which happened on a search for heavy metals to bring back to Earth. \nThe air should be safe to breathe, and they spot both plants and animals, so Four wants to rush outside. Junior pulls Fred into a private conversation explaining that something went wrong and their ship now won\u2019t move. When Four gets back, he brings with him a creature named Fweep: a gelatin-like orb about two feet in diameter that is raspberry in color. When he moves across the tile, he cleans it, picking up what he passes over. Joyce is appalled but Reba insists Four should be able to have a friend, so Four focuses on learning how Fweep's ability works. The ship shook when Grampa patted Fweep, and the family discussed a plan. The polarizer on the ship is broken so they might not be able to go anywhere. Grampa insists it can\u2019t be broken, Junior responds that polarization doesn\u2019t work here, so Fred insists on an explanation from Grampa about how gravity polarization works. Joyce insists Grampa doesn't actually know, and expresses her frustration that they aren't just getting rich from finding uranium. They figure they could build a community on the planet, but having more than one child per family is against their laws. As they argue about options, Four uses another contraption to try to find the planet\u2019s center of gravity. The center of gravity shifts when Fweep leaves - he is a circular polarizer, making the planet heavy, conflicting with the linear polarizer of the spaceship, which is why it can't move. Joyce tries to poison Fweep with rat poison but it can\u2019t hurt him, he doesn\u2019t consume what he picks up but rather uses matter to create radioactive substance: this means he has a lot of mass, and it was him their equipment picked up on, not uranium. They talk about how to turn off his gravity, but they don\u2019t know how, and figure he might be immortal. Fred tries to calm Joyce down but she suggest that they appeal to Fweep to let them go.

Junior is found yelling at a computer and doesn\u2019t want Four to stay behind, he refuses to leave his son on a strange planet. Grampa insists that Junior\u2019s computer work won\u2019t help them because it is not a scientific issue, but rather a moral and logical one.

He is a gelatin-like orb about two feet in diameter that is raspberry in color, and has something resembling a mouth. However, he has an interesting ability in which he picks up particulates on the ground by rolling around. He calls this sweeping, and we find out later in the story that he is able to convert the materials in what he picks up to create radioactive matter. Because of this ability, he has a very high mass which the Peppergrass family misinterpreted as heavy metals as they were scanning the planet, which is what drew them to the planet in the first place. Fweep is also responsible for the ship's crashing: because of his mass, Fweep is a circular polarizer, which conflicted with the linear polarizer of the spaceship. Fweep and Four become instant friends when they meet, which adds another layer of complication to the relationship that the family has with Fweep. He could let the family return home, which they can't do under his gravitational pull, but Fweep does not want to let the family go if that means that Four would leave him, and Four is his only friend.

Four seems to understand the creatures when he talks, and can interpret his requests. Four is a curious child, and wants to solve the problem of why the ship can't go anywhere after it crash landed, so he took Fweep on an adventure to find the center of gravity of the planet. It is Four who discovers that Fweep is the center of gravity, and it is the fact that this point shifts that makes the gravity (and thus, the polarization) so unpredictable. It is also Four who aims to learn more about the planet outside of the ship, and not just about the problems on the ship itself, and it is this perspective that drives any progress they made. Besides learning about the moving center of gravity, he learns about the way Fweep picks things up as he rolls over them, and investigates how he converts matter and what his outer shell might be contributing to the distribution of energy. After discovering that Fweep is responsible for the gravity of the planet, things get more complicated. Four is at the center of a moral conundrum at the end of the story: if the family wants to return home, they have to appeal to Fweep, who controls the polarization on the planet.

She presents as a spoiled, self-centered woman who only wants lots of money. Grampa\u2019s inventions made him a multimillionaire, but she accuses him of wasting the money on new inventions and making it so that they had to travel the galaxy searching for uranium and other habitable worlds.

When Four brings Fweep aboard the flivver, she is thoroughly disgusted and insists he take it back out; when Reba stands up for Four and Fweep and calls Joyce Grammy, Joyce is furious and goes into her private room.

WESTLAKE\nIllustrated by WEST\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Magazine October 1961.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nHe was dangerously insane. He threatened\nto destroy everything that was noble and\ndecent\u2014including my date with my girl!\nWhen the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken\negg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window\nsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry\nlist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put\nthe roof on the city, as they say.\nIt was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're\nlucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\nBut of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been\nbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my\nmind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this\nmorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her\nplace. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the\nphone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten\no'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\nDon't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a\nharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a\nfixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,\nof course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,\nwere invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one\nwaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other\nProject and had blown itself up.\nWell, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three\nyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,\nshortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five\nminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been\nkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from\narriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had\nhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four\ndays.\nAnd then the elevator didn't come.\nUntil then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from\nruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very\nwell throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment\nand I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that\ngaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories\nstraight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal\nspeeches, trying to select the most effective one.\nI had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little\nNon-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a\nRomantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.\nTemporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life\nwith you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a\nStraightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at\nleast a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend\nthat time with than you.\"\nActually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less\nto anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we\nboth had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that\nLinda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract\nfor any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\nSo I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time\ncame I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more\nthan a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and\nmalfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment\nat five minutes to ten.\nLinda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.\nIt never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I\nwas giving myself plenty of time.\nBut then the elevator didn't come.\nI pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't\nunderstand it.\nThe elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of\nthe button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator\nthat traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred\nsixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for\neither the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than\ntwenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\nI pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my\nwatch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If\nit didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\nIt didn't arrive.\nI vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator\nwould come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to\ngive her advance warning that I would be late?\nTen more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second\nalternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my\napartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white\nletters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\nOf course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted\nto say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to\nkeep us from being interrupted.\nFrantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the\nelevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if\nthe elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute\nlate.\nNo matter. It didn't arrive.\nI would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility\npiled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day\nwas just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door\nthree times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was\nhurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the\ndoor behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of\nthe Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud\nthey'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\nI got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.\nIt took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female\nreceptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the\nhundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she\nwere growing very used to saying it.\nIt only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean\ndisconnected? Elevators don't\nget\ndisconnected!\" I told her.\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing\nwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\nI changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,\ngiving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as\nrationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me\nwhy\nthe elevator is disconnected?\"\n\"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her\nlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly\nat her screen and parroted her responses.\nBut now she was actually looking at\nme\n.\nI took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I\nwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just\nwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have\nruined my life.\"\nShe blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly\nthan before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom\nI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you\nunderstand me?\"\nShe nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too\npreoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,\na fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten\no'clock.\nI'm late!\n\" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize\nwhat you've\ndone\n, disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she\nmarry me, she won't even\nspeak\nto me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\"I'm not shouting!\"\n\"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\"You\nunderstand\n?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\nShe looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,\nrevealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay\nany attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,\nsir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll\nunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it\nhad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"\nshe leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\"\nII\nIt was my turn to be stunned.\nI just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and\nmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He\njammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think\nof to get him out.\"\n\"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from\noutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims\nthe elevator at them.\"\nThat sounded impossible. \"He\naims\nthe elevator?\"\n\"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush\nanybody who goes after him.\"\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\nShe leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could\nhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're\nafraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\"Oh, no!\"\nShe nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she\nglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\nFor a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been\ntold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all\nthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\nWhat in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting\nthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many\nmore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\nUntil that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had\nno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and\ncompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our\nroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present\nthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other\npeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't\nreturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the\nbuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny\nradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and\nbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might\nbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And\nwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers\nmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external\ndangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.\nKilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\nDr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years\nold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.\nThere was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as\nWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.\nThe rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of\nmany many factors, but two of the most important were the population\nexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,\nmeant that there was continuously more and more people but never any\nmore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one\ncentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to\nvertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in\ntiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,\neverybody\nlived in\nProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make\nthese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,\nshopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of\nother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely\nself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,\nseparate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot\nore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the\nProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,\nthe population explosion.\nAnd the Treaty of Oslo.\nIt seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing\nnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of\nvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty\nof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added\nthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only\ntactical\natomic\nweapons could be used. No\nstrategic\natomic weapons. (A tactical\nweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is\nsomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody\ndid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which\nmeant that no Projects were bombed.\nOf course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical\natomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole\nworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or\nat least those of them which had in time installed the force screens\nwhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected\nradioactive particles.\nHowever, what with all of the\nother\ntreaties which were broken during\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody\nwas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there\non the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since\nthey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to\nask.\nAnd so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking\nOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\nwas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it\ngo at that.\nBut now there was a spy in the elevator.\nWhen I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how\nmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls\nwere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the\nother side of them.\nI sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\nI leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.\nI dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the\nelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda\nwould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient\nreason for me to be late.\nHe was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\nI sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the\ndoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\nI hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs\nexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and\ndown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of\nstairs since I was twelve years old.\nActually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,\ndidn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was\nthe use of stairs?\nWell, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary\ninformation), the Project had been built when there still had been such\nthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which\nwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government\nhad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which\nrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the\ncity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\nAnd now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after\nall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a\nflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\nCould I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.\nIf the door would open.\nIt would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since\nlast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and\nfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,\ntook a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight\nsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\nOn the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a\nsmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one\ntime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked\naway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered\nthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with\ndifficulty.\nI read them. They said:\nEMERGENCY ENTRANCE\nELEVATOR SHAFT\nAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\nONLY\nKEEP LOCKED\nI frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly\nguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible\nanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply\nhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed\nshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.\nSomebody in authority might simply have goofed.\nAs I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and\nthe spy came out, waving a gun.\nIII\nHe couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first\nplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,\nin the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the\nelevator shaft.\nLooking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we\ncame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.\nUnfortunately, he recovered first.\nHe closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun\nstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't\nmove!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\nI did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.\nWhich left me quite free to study him.\nHe was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony\nhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He\nwore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked\nexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he\ndidn't\nlook like a\nspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he\nreminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to\nmy parents' apartment.\nHis gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand\nat the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\nI had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I\nsaid.\n\"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from\nperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the\nopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending\nboots. The Army!\nBut if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He\nsaid, \"Where do you live?\"\n\"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.\nI knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions\npromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to\neither escape or capture him.\n\"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\nAnd so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at\nthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,\nand grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one\nfalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're\nfriends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\nI nodded.\n\"All right. Let's go.\"\nWe went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as\nit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one\nemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I\nthumbed the door open and we went inside.\nOnce the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against\nthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile\nplaying across his lips.\nI looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could\nleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have\nread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He\nsaid, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill\nanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until\nthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able\nto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any\nsilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got\nany chico coffee?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with\nboiling water.\"\n\"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two\ncups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\"\nAnd now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which\nreminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't\never\ngoing to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me\nand might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\nAs I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,\n\"What do you do for a living?\"\nI thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,\nof course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda\nto be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about\nit.\nActually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included\nwrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him\nin my own fashion, when the time came.\nHe was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the\nore-sleds?\"\nI had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?\nDon't you people ever test them?\"\n\"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's\ninformation to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and\ntheir cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them\nbefore de-radiating them?\"\n\"No. Why should we?\"\n\"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\"For what? Who cares about that?\"\nHe frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself\nthan to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into\nyour caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\nI looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told\nhim.\n\"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with\na fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\nIncredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of\ncourse not!\"\n\"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same\nstupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out\nof the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,\nbefore he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it\ntook for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He\nstarted pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion\nas he talked. \"Is this the\nnatural\nlife of man? It is not. Is this\neven a\ndesirable\nlife for man? It is\ndefinitely\nnot.\" He spun back\nto face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed\nit as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.\n\"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was\ngrowing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all\nthe time. He was planning to tackle\nspace\n! The moon first, and then\nthe planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,\nwaiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching\nout for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it.\nI decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,\nhe was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded\npolitely.\n\"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.\n\"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first\ngiant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little\nhotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned\naround and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his\ntail between his legs.\nThat's\nwhat he did!\"\nTo say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme\nunderstatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by\nsaying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac\nto watchful spy.\nI put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the\nroom and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and\nsuddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\"Of course,\" I said.\nHe grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn\nfools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\nHe asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to\nanswer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't\nknow, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\"Military equipment?\nWhat\nmilitary equipment? Your Army is supplied\nwith uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the\nrocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what\nother defenses are there? None.\"\n\"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had\nadequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy\nspy.\n\"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\"Well, of course.\"\n\"And what are\nthey\nsupposed to spy on?\"\n\"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even\nanswer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by\none of the other projects.\"\n\"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified\ninformation.\"\n\"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's\nwhat\nyour\nspies are doing, and if\nI'm\na spy, then it follows that\nI'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for\nindications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\nI shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\nHe got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's\nnot\nmy\njob, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I\nwere\na spy,\nthen\nthat would be my job!\"\nThe maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.\n\"All right, whatever you say.\"\nHe glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped\nback into the chair.\nHe breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then\nlooked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that\nI\nhad\nfound indications that you people were planning to attack my\nProject?\"\nI stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to\nattack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger\nagain. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for\nthis Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should\nyou think\nthey\nmight see some advantage in attacking\nyou\n?\"\nI shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I\nsaid. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like\nall the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You\nthink I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That\nfathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm\nnot\na spy, and I'm\ngoing to tell you what I am.\"\nI waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.\nI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to\nprotect me.\"\nThe maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the\nviolence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as\nlow as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been\nthat low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He\nleaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there\nnow. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building\nthe dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has\nthe horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the\npitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\nAnd that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I\ndidn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked\non the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the\nradiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly\nhow much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted\nto test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed\npublic safety, but I knew better.

He can tell by her smile on the phone. In preparation for the proposal, Linda has set her phone to PRIVACY DISCONNECTION to prevent their proposal from being interrupted, but this also means that Edmund cannot reach her to let her know he is running late and why. Edmund is convinced that she won\u2019t speak to him again after being late for the proposal and certainly will not accept his proposal. In a last-ditch effort to reach Linda, Edmund decides he can take 208 stairs to reach her, even though he hasn\u2019t taken the stairs since he was 12 years old. This decision, of course, puts him in the path to run into the spy.\n\tFinally, Linda\u2019s job helps Edmund believe he can overtake the spy if he can catch him off guard.

But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\nTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\non that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\nKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\nwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be\nsettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\nFaster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently\nefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en\u2014and that would mean, in\nthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\nPlanets.\nAn invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\nKorvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which\nwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of\nisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\nmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\nno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't\nunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the\nprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat\nsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\nmagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\nto the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\nHe could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\nthat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\neven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to\nall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd\nhave been better than nothing.\nIn any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\nwould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en\nKorvin was all alone.\nTrue, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\nlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\nout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\ndiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\nnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\nat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any\nimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\nHe wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a\nfull stock of food concentrates.\nBut he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\nanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\nAs he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\nup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\nThe Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\nHe looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid\u2014that is, if you\ndon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\nbe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't\nknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\nbut none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\nreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\nThe Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are\nKorvin,\" he said.\nIt was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he\nreplied. The green being nodded.\n\"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\nslightly\u2014but no more than slightly\u2014and came into the cell, closing\nthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided\nquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\nhis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\ntranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a\nsmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\nthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n\"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech\u2014apparently\nthere was only one language on the planet\u2014was stiff and slightly\nawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\nmost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\nacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd\ndealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\ncarefully constructed than even those marvels.\n\"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the\ndoor-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\nKorvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As\nconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\nthan solitude.\n\"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist\napproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\nto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\nsecond.\n\"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\nDidyak beamed at him.

The Ruler wishes to talk with\nyou.\"\nIt wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,\nand Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information\nfrom, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future\nreference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n\"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are\nto go to him. Such is his command.\"\nKorvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the\ncommand of the Ruler,\" he said\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\ncommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to\ntry.\nBut Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the\ncommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014and remove the Tr'en threat from\nthe rest of the galaxy forever.\nThat, after all, was his job.\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\nwalls were dark-brown, the furnishings\u2014a single great chair, several\nkneeling-benches and a small table near the chair\u2014were light-brown,\nof some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\nKorvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\ncontrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\nThe Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\nbroad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\ntable near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\neither side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\nsix and a half feet high.\nKorvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\nHe wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\nThe Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\nThe Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex\u2014if\nany\u2014and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\nKorvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\nam,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n\"Within what limits?\"\nKorvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\nunder four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\ndidn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\nwere at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\nwent on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\nusually less than that\u2014approximately nine or ten inches. We call\nthese\nchildren\n,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n\"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\nsaid. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\nKorvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\nsaid apologetically.\n\"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n\"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\nfor you.\"\n\"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\npaused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\nwent on. \"Why?\"\n\"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\nprove that beyond any doubt.\"\n\"True,\" Korvin said.\n\"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\nKorvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\nhave tests for such matters?\"\n\"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\nmachine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\nIt will be attached to you.\"\nKorvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\ntechnicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\ndials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\nstraps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector\u2014and Korvin felt\nhimself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\nmatch their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\nhypnop\u00e6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\nwonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\nnecessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\nThe Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\naddition to the Comity of Nations.\nBeing what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\nKorvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\nHe hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\nhim telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\njob\u2014not to mention the strongest personal inclinations\u2014demanded most\nstrongly that he stay alive.\nHe swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\nseat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\nelastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\nscrews, he made no resistance.\n\"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n\"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n\"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n\"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n\"Are you a\nchulad\n?\" the Ruler asked. A\nchulad\nwas a small native\npet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\nbeetle.\n\"I am not,\" he said.\nThe Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\nreceiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\nstanding or sitting?\"\n\"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\nThe technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\nKorvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\nthe training.\nHe hoped they were right.\nThe Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n\"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\nThe Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\nwasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\nshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\nKorvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\nThe Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\nship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\nended\n, nor did it\nmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n\"No,\" he said.\n\"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\nKorvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\nThe Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n\"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n\"But it is not\u2014not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\nKorvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n\"I\u2014\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\nlogic\"\u2014the Tr'en word seemed to mean\nright-saying\n\u2014\"who will advise\nthe Ruler. They will be called.\"\nKorvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\nthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\ngestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\nThe Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\nus,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"\u2014\nchulad-like\nKorvin\ntranslated\u2014\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\nKorvin devoutly hoped so.\nThe experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\nwas given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\nanybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,\nthe secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\nthe tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\nwere so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated\nmathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\nKorvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\nBut that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\nconfused by such means.\"\n\"Good,\" Korvin said.\nThe experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said.\n\"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\nThe expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\nbest not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you\ncall this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\nfrom the one we are occupied with.\"\n\"True,\" Korvin said.\nThere was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\nindicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\"\nhe said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\n\"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said.\nThe silence this time was even longer.\n\"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last,\nin a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\nYou must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\nto aid us.\"\nKorvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the\nonly logical deduction.\nBut it happened to be wrong.\n\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n\"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n\"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n\"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n\"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n\"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n\"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n\"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\nThere was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n\"I can,\" Korvin said.\n\"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n\"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n\"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\nKorvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\nA short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\nVery sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n\"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n\"It is,\" Korvin said.\n\"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\nThe key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n\"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n\"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n\"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n\"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n\"True,\" Korvin said.\n\"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n\"True,\" Korvin said again.\nThe ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\nKorvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\nThe Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n\"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n\"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n\"I will not,\" Korvin said.\nIt was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\nThe plan was taking hold.\nThe Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\nKorvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n\"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n\"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\nThe Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\nKorvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\nThe Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n\"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\nKorvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\nThe Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n\"None,\" Korvin said.\n\"But you are governed?\"\nKorvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n\"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n\"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n\"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n\"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n\"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n\"Do you act against your own interests?\"\nKorvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n\"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n\"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\nThe Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n\"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n\"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n\"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n\"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n\"We call our form of government\ndemocracy\n,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\nOne of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n\"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n\"You are lying,\" the expert said.\nOne of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n\"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\nKorvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\nIt took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\nSome of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\nOn the third day Korvin escaped.\nIt wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\nBecause that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\nwas\ninsoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\nKorvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\nBut, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\nThe same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\nHe set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\nMission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\nWith one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\nBut\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\nI'm bored absolutely stiff!\nTHE END\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "8", "uid": "88b4e190c150413cb74b0321488233f5", "response_text": "Korvin sits in a cell after crash-landing on the planet of the Tr'en, which is populated by an extremely logical and intelligent humanoid race. Due to the speed of their scientific and technological advancements, the Comity of Planets will soon extend them an invitation, but Korvin believes they will not accept their offer. As a representative of Earth Central, he has been sent to Tr'en in order to find a way to prevent its people from marauding and settling other planets. In the days since Korvin's crash, the prison guards provide him with food and teach him the local language through drug hypnosis. He describes the language as \"stiff and slightly awkward\" but acknowledges its logical, meticulous construction. After several days imprisoned, a Tr'en named Didyak visits Korvin and informs him that he will be brought to The Ruler. When Korvin meets The Ruler--a massive, formidable Tr'en--he answers his questions to the best of his ability with respect to the logical constructions of the language. Korvin describes the physical appearance of adult humans as well as children, and The Ruler appears confused by the variations in height. The Ruler keeps emphasizing the importance of speaking with exactitude when communicating with the Tr'en. When Korvin claims his purpose on the planet was to crash-land his ship, The Ruler scoffs and orders him connected to a lie-detector machine for the duration of the questioning. After adjusting the lie-detector machine to Korvin's physiology, The Ruler continues his interrogation of Korvin, attempting to determine the true purpose of his mission on Tr'en. Adopting the Tr'en mode of providing extremely logical answers, Korvin claims his mission is to \"stay alive\", which frustrates The Ruler; he claims Korvin is trying to confuse him, so he calls upon his experts to help determine if the machine is faulty and analyze Korvin's responses. As the Tr'en broach the subject of Earth, they start to ask questions about its name, location, and finally, governance. Because the Tr'en receive and obey orders from one Ruler, they are completely perplexed by the concept of democracy where conflicting interests may contribute to a system of self-governance. In fact, they are so stumped by Korvin's responses that they continue this line of questioning for three days and are unsatisfied by what they consider to be his illogical, but truthful answers.

Korvin had learned some of the Tr'en language under drug hypnosis but was frustrated with how literally Didyak took everything, so it took some time to determine that The Ruler had summoned Korvin for a conversation. This was what he wanted, though: Korvin had been sent to eliminate the threat the the Tr'en posed to the Comity of Planets and the rest of the galaxy because of how quickly their technology was developing. When he got to the Room of the Ruler, Korvin met The Ruler who was over seven feet tall, which was tall even for the Tr'en. The Ruler started with questions about how typical of a human Korvin was, and Korvin found himself apologizing for his race's inclination towards approximation over precision. They don't believe Korvin when he says that his job required he be on this planet, and the Tr'en brought out a lie detector that they built. Korvin was worried about the calibration of the machine, because he knew one misstep would mean death. After the machine was calibrated, the questioning continued, and the Tr'en had to accept that Korvin crashed his ship on purpose. Korvin's truth was not the truth that the Tr'en wanted, which Korvin used against the logic-led race. Experts in logic were called into the room, and Korvin quickly learned that logical paradoxes would not trick the Tr'en. He gave them just enough information for them to logically conclude, incorrectly, that Korvin was there to get help invading Earth. They discussed their respective forms of government, and when The Ruler asked who is in charge on Earth, Korvin refused to give away that information. This causes frustration, and the seed of confusion had been planted. Korvin asked them about their government, which has one being ruling everyone else. Korvin tried to explain that there is no one governor, and that everyone governs, which made no sense to the Tr'en. They did not understand how there was not a single ruler to make decisions; democracy seemed impossible to them. One of the experts insisted that Korvin was lying and that something must be wrong with the machine; they took a three-day break from questioning to investigate the issue only to conclude that nothing was wrong. On this third day, Korvin escaped. He knew the Tr'en couldn't conclude that it was an impossible problem, so their subconsciouses would prepare Korvin for an escape so that their conscious selves wouldn't have to admit that they did not have the answer.

When Didyak uses the word \u201ctalk\u201d that means to \u201cgain information from, by peaceful and vocal means,\u201d Korvin realizes that he will be able to save himself and his mission by communicating with the Tr\u2019ens in a way that literally answers their questions without giving away his true mission of stopping the Tr\u2019en\u2019s advancement into the galaxy. \n     When the Ruler tries to find out Korvin\u2019s purpose for intentionally crashing his ship and if he has other intentions, Korvin\u2019s responses are forthright in a literal sense: yes, he crashed his ship on purpose, no his job isn\u2019t ended, now his job is to stay alive.       \n     Completely flummoxed, the Ruler calls in his experts in logic to question Korvin further, and based on his answers, they logically conclude that he is a traitor to Earth and is there to help the Tr\u2019ens overthrow Earth.

Imagine Fawkes'\nterrible predicament; plenty of food\u2014and\ntwenty seven beautiful girls for companions.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nJonathan Fawkes opened his eyes. He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n\"You're not dead?\"\n\"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n\"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n\"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\nShe pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n\"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\nHe shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling\ninto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\nThe girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\nThe girl shrugged her shoulders.\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n\"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n\"We?\" he looked back at her.\n\"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n\"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\nShe nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n\"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n\"We hit this asteroid.\"\n\"But that was three years ago.\"\n\"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her\neyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self\nconscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw\nyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a\nheap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n\"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about\nfour miles,\" she said.\n\"I think so,\" he said.\nJonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space\nship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They\nwere the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he\nrealized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown\nof concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.\nOn the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward\nthem.\nShe said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her\nstomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared\nafter her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice.\nHe let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like\nhe was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled\nafter the girl. \"What's wrong?\"\nThe girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I\ndidn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which\nleads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach\nthe hills we'll be safe.\"\n\"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\"\n\"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was\nwrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head\nforemost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom,\nwinced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the\nhills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.\n\"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted.\n\"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could\nget around in the hills.\"\nThe gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a\ngorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon\nof sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the\ncrevices and floor of the canyon.\nThey flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped\naway, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her\narm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied\nit to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded\nhim. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year\n3372; not the time of ancient Greece.\nThe canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more\nprecipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the\nuniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.\n\"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette\npackage, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.\n\"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope.\nThe girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we\nwere here.\"\nJonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.\n\"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm.\nHe said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the\nfreighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\"\n\"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her\ngrip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said.\n\"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship.\nI don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley\ntobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on\nGanymede.\"\n\"No!\"\nHe lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly\ndetached her hand.\nThe girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.\n\"We are going to the camp,\" she said.\nJonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from\nunder her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.\nA voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\"\nHe paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward\nthem from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was\nbarefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around\nher sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her\nbrown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table\ncloth at one time in its history.\n\"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a\nman!\"\n\"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann.\n\"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\"\nA third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off\nwarily.\nAnn Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\"\nJonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way\nhe had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the\ncanyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the\nbend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.\nJonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer\nweight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up\nbodily, started up the canyon chanting: \"\nHe was a rocket riding daddy\nfrom Mars.\n\" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.\nJonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the\nspaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had\nbeen broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of\nhis left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy,\ntough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from\nmortification.\nHe said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\"\n\"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann.\n\"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being\nheld aloft by four barbarous young women.\n\"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a\nbreak.\"\nJonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between\ntwo husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease\nwith which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light\nweight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the\nplains. He wished he was a centaur.\nThe trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan\npicked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised\none of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\"\n\"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow\nledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from\nunder him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment\nhe thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck,\nhauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a\nrope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top\nlike a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.\nThe trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking\nthe prairie.\n\"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge.\nA half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first,\nJonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up\nthey resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to\nhis own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.\n\"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.\nThe girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who\nreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they\nhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly\nlike the neighing of horses.\nAmazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem\nof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred\nto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's\nmoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to\nthe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty\ntimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.\nAt length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults\nback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls\nresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.\nThe brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.\n\"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome\nfellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.\nThey climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep\nvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees\nalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of\nthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.\nThey started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind\na promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming\nordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew\nthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp\nlike a bag of meal.\nThe trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner\nreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded\nand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded\nhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He\nlooked away hastily.\nSomeone hailed them from the space ship.\n\"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors.\nA flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.\n\"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She\nhad green eyes. \"We're rescued!\"\n\"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\"\n\"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus.\n\"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\"\n\"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could\nlook so good?\"\n\"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered\nlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt\nlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.\nA big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,\n\"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of\nthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him\nappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him\ninto the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\"\nHe was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the\nwrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of\nthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His\nfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the\nThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.\nWith a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang\nforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be\nseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like\na captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar\nsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan\nFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild\nwomen.\nAs the meal boisterously progressed, he regained sufficient courage\nto glance timidly around. Directly across the table sat a striking,\ngrey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She\nlooked to him like a stenographer. He watched horrified as she seized\na whole roast fowl, tore it apart with her fingers, gnawed a leg. She\ncaught him staring at her and rolled her eyes at him. He returned his\ngaze to his plate.\nOlga said: \"Hey, Sultan.\"\nHe shuddered, but looked up questioningly.\nShe said, \"How's the fish?\"\n\"Good,\" he mumbled between a mouthful. \"Where did you get it?\"\n\"Caught it,\" said Olga. \"The stream's full of 'em. I'll take you\nfishing tomorrow.\" She winked at him so brazenly that he choked on a\nbone.\n\"Heaven forbid,\" he said.\n\"How about coming with me to gather fruit?\" cried the green-eyed\nblonde; \"you great big handsome man.\"\n\"Or me?\" cried another. And the table was in an uproar.\nThe rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table\nuntil the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was\ncalled Billy.\n\"Quiet!\" She shrieked in her loud strident voice. \"Let him be. He can't\ngo anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs\nrest.\" She turned to Jonathan who had shrunk down in his chair. \"How\nabout some roast?\" she said.\n\"No.\" He pushed back his plate with a sigh. \"If I only had a smoke.\"\nOlga gave her unruly black hair a flirt. \"Isn't that just like a man?\"\n\"I wouldn't know,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"I've forgotten what\nthey're like.\"\nBilly said, \"How badly wrecked is your ship?\"\n\"It's strewn all over the landscape,\" he replied sleepily.\n\"Is there any chance of patching it up?\"\nHe considered the question. More than anything else, he decided, he\nwanted to sleep. \"What?\" he said.\n\"Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?\" repeated Billy.\n\"Not outside the space docks.\"\nThey expelled their breath, but not for an instant did they relax\nthe barrage of their eyes. He shifted position in embarrassment. The\nmovement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering\nlassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes.\n\"You look exhausted,\" said Ann.\nJonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. \"Just tired,\" he\nmumbled. \"Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars.\" Indeed\nit was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His\neyelids drooped lower and lower.\n\"First it's tobacco,\" said Olga; \"now he wants to sleep. Twenty-seven\ngirls and he wants to sleep.\"\n\"He is asleep,\" said the green-eyed blonde.\nJonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in his\narms.\n\"Catch a hold,\" said Billy, pushing back from the table. A dozen girls\nvolunteered with a rush. \"Hoist!\" said Billy. They lifted him like a\nsleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom,\nwhere they deposited him on the bed.\nAnn said to Olga; \"Help me with these boots.\" But they resisted every\ntug. \"It's no use,\" groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her bright\nyellow hair back from her eyes. \"His feet have swollen. We'll have to\ncut them off.\"\nAt these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.\n\"\nCut off whose feet?\n\" he cried in alarm.\n\"Not your feet, silly,\" said Ann. \"Your boots.\"\n\"Lay a hand on those boots,\" he scowled; \"and I'll make me another pair\nout of your hides. They set me back a week's salary.\" Having delivered\nhimself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.\nOlga clapped her hand to her forehead. \"And this,\" she cried \"is what\nwe've been praying for during the last three years.\"\nThe next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a\ncane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced\nall around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he\npresumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits\nand berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He\nwalked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be\nhanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.\nHe sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by\ntwenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it\noff in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the\nshade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be\nyears before they were rescued.\nAs a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join\nthe centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plains\non the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde was\nambling toward him.\n\"How's the invalid?\" she said, seating herself beside him.\n\"Hot, isn't it?\" he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed the\nflat of her hand on his chest and shoved. \"\nOoof!\n\" he grunted. He sat\ndown rather more forcibly than he had risen.\n\"Don't get up because of me,\" she informed him. \"It's my turn to cook,\nbut I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do\nyou know that you are irresistible?\" She seized his shoulders, stared\ninto his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a\nhungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his brow\nwith his sleeve.\n\"Suppose the rest should come,\" he said in an embarrassed voice.\n\"They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Your\neyes,\" she said, \"are like deep mysterious pools.\"\n\"Sure enough?\" said Jonathan with involuntary interest. He began to\nrecover his nerve.\nShe said, \"You're the best looking thing.\" She rumpled his hair. \"I\ncan't keep my eyes off you.\"\nJonathan put his arm around her gingerly. \"Ouch!\" He winced. He had\nforgotten his sore muscles.\n\"I forgot,\" said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.\n\"You're hurt.\"\nHe pulled her back down. \"Not so you could notice it,\" he grinned.\n\"Well!\" came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. \"We're\nall\nglad to hear that!\"\nJonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerked\naround. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their\nfeatures were grim. He said: \"I don't feel so well after all.\"\n\"It don't wash,\" said Billy. \"It's time for a showdown.\"\nJonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take\nher stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a\nmenacing angle. She said in an angry voice: \"He's mine. I found him.\nLeave him alone.\"\n\"Where do you get that stuff?\" cried Olga. \"Share and share alike, say\nI.\"\n\"We could draw straws for him,\" suggested the green-eyed blonde.\n\"Look here,\" Jonathan broke in. \"I've got some say in the matter.\"\n\"You have not,\" snapped Billy. \"You'll do just as we say.\" She took a\nstep toward him.\nJonathan edged away in consternation.\n\"He's going to run!\" Olga shouted.\nJonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the\nplain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothing\nrelaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettes\nat the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.\nAt the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs,\nhe scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his space\nship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted and\ntore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside the\nwreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscription\nin silver letters: \"INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.\"\nTwo men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced in\nsurprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon Ray\nRifle in his hand.\n\"I'm Jonathan Fawkes,\" said the castaway as he panted up, \"pilot for\nUniversal. I was wrecked.\"\nA tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed\nmustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a\nyellow composition holder. He said, \"I'm Doctor Boynton.\" He had a\nrich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. \"We are members of the\nInterstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a\ncursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr.\nFawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning\nwhen we sighted the wreck.\"\n\"I say,\" said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim,\nenergetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun\ngingerly, respectfully. \"We're a week overdue now,\" he said. \"If you\nhave any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd\nbest be getting them aboard.\"\nJonathan's face broke into a grin. He said, \"Do any of you know how to\ngrow tobacco?\"\nThey glanced at each other in perplexity.\n\"I like it here,\" continued Jonathan. \"I'm not going back.\"\n\"What?\" cried the three explorers in one breath.\n\"I'm going to stay,\" he repeated. \"I only came back here after the\ncigarettes.\"\n\"But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it back\nin the space lanes,\" said Doctor Boynton. \"You don't possibly expect to\nbe picked up before then!\"\nJonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobacco\nseed, and cigarettes.\n\"Odd.\" Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. \"Though if\nI remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits during\nthe medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to the\nwilderness to escape the temptation of\nwomen\n.\"\nJonathan laughed outright.\n\"You are sure you won't return, young man?\"\nHe shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant.\nHe said, \"You might report my accident to Universal. Tell them to stop\none of their Jupiter-bound freighters here when the asteroid swings\nback in the space ways. I'll have a load for them.\"\nInside the ship, Doctor Boynton moved over to a round transparent port\nhole. \"What a strange fellow,\" he murmured.

Snithian was a bald eagle of a man, dark-eyed, pot-bellied,\nwith the large, expressive hands of a rug merchant. Round-shouldered\nin a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane's\ntravel-stained six foot one.\n\"Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me.\" He nodded toward\nthe florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like something\nthat needed oiling. \"Something about important information regarding\nsafeguarding my paintings.\"\n\"That's right, Mr. Snithian,\" Dan said. \"I believe I can be of great\nhelp to you.\"\n\"Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me....\" The red eyes bored\ninto Dan like hot pokers.\n\"Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guards\nhere\u2014the papers are full of it\u2014\"\n\"Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press,\nI'd have no concern for my paintings today!\"\n\"Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been left\nunguarded.\"\n\"Now, wait a minute\u2014\" Kelly started.\n\"What's that?\" Snithian cut in.\n\"You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds day\nand night\u2014\"\n\"Two hundred and twenty-five,\" Kelly snapped.\n\"\u2014but no one at all in the vault with the paintings,\" Slane finished.\n\"Of course not,\" Snithian shrilled. \"Why should I post a man in the\nvault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.\"\n\"The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault,\" Dan said.\n\"There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.\"\n\"By the saints, he's right,\" Kelly exclaimed. \"Maybe we ought to have a\nman in that vault.\"\n\"Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,\" Snithian snapped. \"I've\nmade you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more\nnonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!\" Snithian turned and stalked\naway, his cloak flapping at his knees.\n\"I'll work cheap,\" Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. \"I'm an\nart lover.\"\n\"Never mind that,\" Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He\nturned in at an office and closed the door.\n\"Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If\nthose pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad.\nJust how cheap would you work?\"\n\"A hundred dollars a week,\" Dan said promptly. \"Plus expenses,\" he\nadded.\nKelly nodded. \"I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. If\nyou're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.\"\nDan looked around at the gray walls, with shelves stacked to the low\nceiling with wrapped paintings. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs shed a\nwhite glare over the tile floor, a neat white refrigerator, a bunk,\nan arm-chair, a bookshelf and a small table set with paper plates,\nplastic utensils and a portable radio\u2014all hastily installed at Kelly's\norder. Dan opened the refrigerator, looked over the stock of salami,\nliverwurst, cheese and beer. He opened a loaf of bread, built up a\nwell-filled sandwich, keyed open a can of beer.\nIt wasn't fancy, but it would do. Phase one of the plan had gone off\nwithout a hitch.\nBasically, his idea was simple. Art collections had been disappearing\nfrom closely guarded galleries and homes all over the world. It was\nobvious that no one could enter a locked vault, remove a stack of large\ncanvases and leave, unnoticed by watchful guards\u2014and leaving the locks\nundamaged.\nYet the paintings were gone. Someone had been in those vaults\u2014someone\nwho hadn't entered in the usual way.\nTheory failed at that point; that left the experimental method. The\nSnithian collection was the largest west of the Mississippi. With\nsuch a target, the thieves were bound to show up. If Dan sat in the\nvault\u2014day and night\u2014waiting\u2014he would see for himself how they\noperated.\nHe finished his sandwich, went to the shelves and pulled down one of\nthe brown-paper bundles. Loosening the string binding the package, he\nslid a painting into view. It was a gaily colored view of an open-air\ncafe, with a group of men and women in gay-ninetyish costumes gathered\nat a table. He seemed to remember reading something about it in a\nmagazine. It was a cheerful scene; Dan liked it. Still, it hardly\nseemed worth all the effort....\nHe went to the wall switch and turned off the lights. The orange glow\nof the filaments died, leaving only a faint illumination from the\nnight-light over the door. When the thieves arrived, it might give him\na momentary advantage if his eyes were adjusted to the dark. He groped\nhis way to the bunk.\nSo far, so good, he reflected, stretching out. When they showed up,\nhe'd have to handle everything just right. If he scared them off\nthere'd be no second chance. He would have lost his crack at\u2014whatever\nhis discovery might mean to him.\nBut he was ready. Let them come.\nEight hours, three sandwiches and six beers later, Dan roused suddenly\nfrom a light doze and sat up on the cot. Between him and the crowded\nshelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air.\nThe apparition was an open-work cage\u2014about the size and shape of an\nout-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures\nwere visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs.\nThey glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework.\nA faint sound cut into the stillness\u2014a descending whine. The cage\nmoved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped,\ncrackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage\nsettled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly\nswitches....\nThe glow died.\nDan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth\nwas dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it\nwas here\u2014\nNever mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had\nprepared for the occasion:\nGreeting, visitors from the Future....\nHopelessly corny. What about:\nWelcome to the Twentieth Century....\nNo good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to\nDan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now\nlooked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with\na cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves\nlooked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and\nbalding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed\nDan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the\ntable, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at\nthe stacked shelves.\n\"Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,\" the shorter man said.\n\"Fathead's gonna be pleased.\"\n\"A very gratifying consignment,\" his companion said. \"However, we'd\nbest hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?\"\n\"Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.\"\nThe thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting.\n\"Ah, magnificent. Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.\"\nManny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack.\n\"Like always,\" he grumbled. \"No nood dames. I like nood dames.\"\n\"Look at this, Manny! The textures alone\u2014\"\nManny looked. \"Yeah, nice use of values,\" he conceded. \"But I still\nprefer nood dames, Fiorello.\"\n\"And this!\" Fiorello lifted the next painting. \"Look at that gay play\nof rich browns!\"\n\"I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,\" Manny said. \"They was\npopular with the sparrows.\"\n\"Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations\u2014\"\n\"Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.\" Manny, turning to place a painting\nin the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting\nclattered to the floor. Dan stood, cleared his throat. \"Uh....\"\n\"Oh-oh,\" Manny said. \"A double-cross.\"\n\"I've\u2014ah\u2014been expecting you gentlemen,\" Dan said. \"I\u2014\"\n\"I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,\"\nManny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow,\nFiorello.\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty\u2014\"\n\"Don't start nothing, Buster,\" Manny said cautiously. \"We're plenty\ntough guys when aroused.\"\n\"I want to talk to you,\" Dan insisted. \"You see, these paintings\u2014\"\n\"Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake. Like, we figured this was the\ngent's room\u2014\"\n\"Never mind, Manny,\" Fiorello cut in. \"It appears there's been a leak.\"\nDan shook his head. \"No leak. I simply deduced\u2014\"\n\"Look, Fiorello,\" Manny said. \"You chin if you want to; I'm doing a\nfast fade.\"\n\"Don't act hastily, Manny. You know where you'll end.\"\n\"Wait a minute!\" Dan shouted. \"I'd like to make a deal with you\nfellows.\"\n\"Ah-hah!\" Kelly's voice blared from somewhere. \"I knew it! Slane, you\ncrook!\"\nDan looked about wildly. The voice seemed to be issuing from a speaker.\nIt appeared Kelly hedged his bets.\n\"Mr. Kelly, I can explain everything!\" Dan called. He turned back to\nFiorello. \"Listen, I figured out\u2014\"\n\"Pretty clever!\" Kelly's voice barked. \"Inside job. But it takes more\nthan the likes of you to out-fox an old-timer like Eddie Kelly.\"\n\"Perhaps you were right, Manny,\" Fiorello said. \"Complications are\narising. We'd best depart with all deliberate haste.\" He edged toward\nthe cage.\n\"What about this ginzo?\" Manny jerked a thumb toward Dan. \"He's on to\nus.\"\n\"Can't be helped.\"\n\"Look\u2014I want to go with you!\" Dan shouted.\n\"I'll bet you do!\" Kelly's voice roared. \"One more minute and I'll have\nthe door open and collar the lot of you! Came up through a tunnel, did\nyou?\"\n\"You can't go, my dear fellow,\" Fiorello said. \"Room for two, no more.\"\nDan whirled to the cot, grabbed up the pistol Kelly had supplied. He\naimed it at Manny. \"You stay here, Manny! I'm going with Fiorello in\nthe time machine.\"\n\"Are you nuts?\" Manny demanded.\n\"I'm flattered, dear boy,\" Fiorello said, \"but\u2014\"\n\"Let's get moving. Kelly will have that lock open in a minute.\"\n\"You can't leave me here!\" Manny spluttered, watching Dan crowd into\nthe cage beside Fiorello.\n\"We'll send for you,\" Dan said. \"Let's go, Fiorello.\"\nThe balding man snatched suddenly for the gun. Dan wrestled with him.\nThe pistol fell, bounced on the floor of the cage, skidded into the\nfar corner of the vault. Manny charged, reaching for Dan as he twisted\naside; Fiorello's elbow caught him in the mouth. Manny staggered back\ninto the arms of Kelly, bursting red-faced into the vault.\n\"Manny!\" Fiorello released his grip on Dan, lunged to aid his\ncompanion. Kelly passed Manny to one of three cops crowding in on his\nheels. Dan clung to the framework as Fiorello grappled with Kelly. A\ncop pushed past them, spotted Dan, moved in briskly for the pinch. Dan\ngrabbed a lever at random and pulled.\nSudden silence fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral\nKelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan\nswallowed hard and nudged a second lever. The cage sank like an\nelevator into the floor, vivid blue washing up its sides.\nHastily he reversed the control. Operating a time machine was tricky\nbusiness. One little slip, and the Slane molecules would be squeezing\nin among brick and mortar particles....\nBut this was no time to be cautious. Things hadn't turned out just the\nway he'd planned, but after all, this was what he'd wanted\u2014in a way.\nThe time machine was his to command. And if he gave up now and crawled\nback into the vault, Kelly would gather him in and pin every art theft\nof the past decade on him.\nIt couldn't be\ntoo\nhard. He'd take it slowly, figure out the\ncontrols....\nDan took a deep breath and tried another lever. The cage rose gently,\nin eerie silence. It reached the ceiling and kept going. Dan gritted\nhis teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage.\nThen he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A blue-haloed cook\nwaddled to a luminous refrigerator, caught sight of Dan rising slowly\nfrom the floor, stumbled back, mouth open. The cage rose, penetrated a\nsecond ceiling. Dan looked around at a carpeted hall.\nCautiously he neutralized the control lever. The cage came to rest an\ninch above the floor. As far as Dan could tell, he hadn't traveled so\nmuch as a minute into the past or future.\nHe looked over the controls. There should be one labeled \"Forward\"\nand another labeled \"Back\", but all the levers were plain, unadorned\nblack. They looked, Dan decided, like ordinary circuit-breaker type\nknife-switches. In fact, the whole apparatus had the appearance of\nsomething thrown together hastily from common materials. Still, it\nworked. So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in the\nusual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be here\nsomewhere....\nDan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.\nA girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. In\nanother second she would see him, and give the alarm\u2014and Dan needed\na few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls.\nHe moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced through\nthe wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the lever\nback. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a\nfour-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table\u2014\nThe door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Not\nover eighteen, Dan thought\u2014as nearly as he could tell with the blue\nlight playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon,\nand long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennis\nracquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan and\nthe cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple,\nand began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.\nDan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another;\nhe rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid the\nzipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot toward\nthe outer wall as the girl reached behind her back....\nDan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hovering\ntwenty feet above a clipped lawn.\nHe looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved the\ncage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man stepped\nout on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his face\nup\u2014\nDan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall. He was in a\nplain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planter\nfilled with glowing blue plants\u2014\nThe door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as she\ntook a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-square\nsunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside,\nseemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled\u2014\nWith a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, the\ncage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off with\nan acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for the\ncontrols, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushed\non, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town,\napproaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared up\nfifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it\u2014\nHe covered his ears, braced himself\u2014\nWith an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of the\ncage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop.\nDan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud\nclick!\nand the glow faded.\nWith a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around at\na simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through\nelaborate venetian blinds. There were posters on the wall, a potted\nplant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the far\nside of the room a desk. And behind the desk\u2014Something.\nII\nDan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like a\nhundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him from\npoints eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfolded\nand reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss three\npeanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened just\nabove the brown eyes.\n\"Who're you?\" a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor.\n\"I'm ... I'm ... Dan Slane ... your honor.\"\n\"What happened to Manny and Fiorello?\"\n\"They\u2014I\u2014There was this cop. Kelly\u2014\"\n\"Oh-oh.\" The brown eyes blinked deliberately. The many-fingered hands\nclosed the peanut carton and tucked it into a drawer.\n\"Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted,\" the basso voice said. \"A\npity to terminate so happy an enterprise. Still....\" A noise like an\namplified Bronx cheer issued from the wide mouth.\n\"How ... what...?\"\n\"The carrier returns here automatically when the charge drops below a\ncritical value,\" the voice said. \"A necessary measure to discourage\nbig ideas on the part of wisenheimers in my employ. May I ask how you\nhappen to be aboard the carrier, by the way?\"\n\"I just wanted\u2014I mean, after I figured out\u2014that is, the police ... I\nwent for help,\" Dan finished lamely.\n\"Help? Out of the picture, unfortunately. One must maintain one's\nanonymity, you'll appreciate. My operation here is under wraps at\npresent. Ah, I don't suppose you brought any paintings?\"\nDan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes,\naccustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make out\nthe vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headed\ngiraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a face\nsimilar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles painted\naround the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fire\ninto a black sky.\n\"Too bad.\" The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted,\ncaught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked up\nto catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busily\nat work studying the ceiling.\n\"I hope,\" the voice said, \"that you ain't harboring no reactionary\nracial prejudices.\"\n\"Gosh, no,\" Dan reassured the eye. \"I'm crazy about\u2014uh\u2014\"\n\"Vorplischers,\" the voice said. \"From Vorplisch, or Vega, as you call\nit.\" The Bronx cheer sounded again. \"How I long to glimpse once more my\nnative fens! Wherever one wanders, there's no pad like home.\"\n\"That reminds me,\" Dan said. \"I have to be running along now.\" He\nsidled toward the door.\n\"Stick around, Dan,\" the voice rumbled. \"How about a drink? I can\noffer you Chateau Neuf du Pape, '59, Romance Conte, '32, goat's milk,\nPepsi\u2014\"\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\"If you don't mind, I believe I'll have a Big Orange.\" The Vorplischer\nswiveled to a small refrigerator, removed an immense bottle fitted with\na nipple and turned back to Dan. \"Now, I got a proposition which may be\nof some interest to you. The loss of Manny and Fiorello is a serious\nblow, but we may yet recoup the situation. You made the scene at a most\nopportune time. What I got in mind is, with those two clowns out of the\npicture, a vacancy exists on my staff, which you might well fill. How\ndoes that grab you?\"\n\"You mean you want me to take over operating the time machine?\"\n\"Time machine?\" The brown eyes blinked alternately. \"I fear some\nconfusion exists. I don't quite dig the significance of the term.\"\n\"That thing,\" Dan jabbed a thumb toward the cage. \"The machine I came\nhere in. You want me\u2014\"\n\"Time machine,\" the voice repeated. \"Some sort of chronometer, perhaps?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I pride myself on my command of the local idiom, yet I confess the\nimplied concept snows me.\" The nine-fingered hands folded on the desk.\nThe beachball head leaned forward interestedly. \"Clue me, Dan. What's a\ntime machine?\"\n\"Well, it's what you use to travel through time.\"\nThe brown eyes blinked in agitated alternation. \"Apparently I've loused\nup my investigation of the local cultural background. I had no idea\nyou were capable of that sort of thing.\" The immense head leaned back,\nthe wide mouth opening and closing rapidly. \"And to think I've been\nspinning my wheels collecting primitive 2-D art!\"\n\"But\u2014don't you have a time machine? I mean, isn't that one?\"\n\"That? That's merely a carrier. Now tell me more about your time\nmachines. A fascinating concept! My superiors will be delighted at\nthis development\u2014and astonished as well. They regard this planet as\nEndsville.\"\n\"Your superiors?\" Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he\ncould reach the machine and try a getaway\u2014\n\"I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,\" the beachball said,\nfollowing Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch\nyellow cylinder lying on the desk. \"Until the carrier is fueled, I'm\nafraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best\nintroduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth\nClass, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop\nnew sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire\nSecondary Quadrant.\"\n\"But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That\nhas\nto be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just\nmaterialize out of thin air like that.\"\n\"You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,\" Blote said. \"You\nshouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel,\nthat everyone has. Now\u2014\" Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper\u2014\"I'll\nmake a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good\ncondition for me. And in return\u2014\"\n\"\nI'm\nsupposed to supply\nyou\nwith a time machine?\"\nBlote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. \"I dislike pointing it out,\nDan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal\nentry, illegal possession of property, trespass\u2014then doubtless some\nembarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr.\nKelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would\ndeal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.\"\nThe Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the\ndesk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.\n\"Whereas, on the other hand,\" Blote's bass voice went on, \"you and me\ngot the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up\nwith an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I\nshould say. What about it, Dan?\"\n\"Ah, let me see,\" Dan temporized. \"Time machine. Time machine\u2014\"\n\"Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,\" Blote rumbled ominously.\n\"I'd better look in the phone book,\" Dan suggested.\nSilently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.\n\"Time, time. Let's see....\" He brightened. \"Time, Incorporated; local\nbranch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.\"\n\"A sales center?\" Blote inquired. \"Or a manufacturing complex?\"\n\"Both,\" Dan said. \"I'll just nip over and\u2014\"\n\"That won't be necessary, Dan,\" Blote said. \"I'll accompany you.\" He\ntook the directory, studied it.\n\"Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice\nit. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a\nlarge.\" He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel\ncells. \"Now, off to gather in the time machine.\" He took his place in\nthe carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. \"Come, Dan.\nGet a wiggle on.\"\nHesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a\npoint\u2014but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat.\nBlote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct\nme, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you\nsaid.\"\n\"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that\nway.\"\nBlote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky.\nFaint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan\nlooked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.\n\"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped\nsmoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.\n\"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to\nget us to the right place.\"\n\"Very well, Dan.\"\nDan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly\nseen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage\ngrew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained.\nThe cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying\nlandmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely\nvisible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers\nalong both sides of the passage at once.\n\"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines\nemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n\"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where\nthey do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered\nleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous\nfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed\nwrong\u2014\nThe scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.\nBlote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete\nwalls, the barred door and\u2014\n\"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n\"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\nBlote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt\nto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a\nlever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures\nas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\nIII\nDan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the\nclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was no\ntelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide\nthe carrier, then\u2014\nA low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.\nDan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\nThe sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of\nmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous\nlandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the\ndeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.\nIf the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked\nthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\nThe noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought\nthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few\ninches and cut the switch.\nAs the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\nDan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise\nwas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians\nin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why\nhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no\nsound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a\nsecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,\nreached for the controls\u2014\nThere was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials\nbefore him frosted over. There was a loud\npop!\nlike a flashbulb\nexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle\nwhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded\nto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a\ntight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\nDan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,\nthe long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly\nred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat\npillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set\nyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in\na smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n\"\nAlors, monsieur\n,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in\na quick bow. \"\nVous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?\n\"\n\"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n\"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.\nPermit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class\nfive, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n\"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\"\nDzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to\nstop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n\"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n\"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n\"Inter-what?\"\n\"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our\nlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n\"What do you want with me?\"\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "101", "uid": "5dd4584b64cd4013a05f1a25d0fb5c3b", "response_text": "Dan Slane is in Clyde Snithian's office; he proposes that, in response to a recent slew of art thefts, he guard Snithian's art vault overnight in addition to the external security he has.
