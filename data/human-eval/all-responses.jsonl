They are on a Mapping Command sent from Earth to explore new planets, assess them for life-forms and evaluate the ability of human colonization.\nThis planet is peculiar because it contains stone building structures that are over 15,000 years old. Steffens and Ball discuss the profound realization that to be that old, the alien race that erected them must be quite advanced, with interstellar travel while humans were still throwing spears around. They conclude there were castaways stranded on the planet that were then evacuated since they could find no other traces of civilization besides the structures.\nThey begin mystery-solving, wondering if the race evacuated to a different planet. The readings from the system indicate that there are moons, and the Third planet has a suitable temperature range for life, but has a CO2 atmosphere. They take their ship down to cruising altitude on the Third planet and find cities that have all been obliterated into black craters at least three miles in diameter and very deep. They are shaken, and then Steffens spots the most perfect robots he has ever seen. They are black plastic, expertly crafted, have hanging arms and legs and move with a gliding motion. \nHe is forbidden by League Law from contacting planet-bound races. He is not clear if robots are a race (sentient robots are banned on Earth) and thinks that he could be in trouble whether he contacts them or not. Contacting them if they are a race would be bad, and also he would be dismissed for not fulfilling his mapping duties if they aren\u2019t a race. As he wonders, the robots contact the humans telepathically, urging them to land since their only desire is to serve and sending a visual of a robot extending a handshake.\nSteffens decides not to reach out to the Alien Contact branch, and makes contact and lands on the planet. The robots are disappointed when the humans land, but show examples of caring for them like cleaning up the radiation so that the humans can feel more comfortable, and spreading their robot bodies out across the planet because they themselves are radioactive.\nThe humans spend three weeks gathering knowledge of the planet. Steffens begins to inquire about their origins and finds they were constructed by \u201cMakers\u201d who are no longer on the planet, but that the robots believe will return. They were disappointed when the humans landed because they did not communicate telepathically and so could not be the makers. The robots also have Factories on the planet where they are constructed.

Jorj is a forty year old Thinker, a class of individuals who work with the US government on various projects, such as monthly rockets to Mars and a super-intelligent computer Maizie. As Jorj prepares for his day, he receives a call from the President, who is waiting to see Maizie. \nMaizie, a large computer with large panels, controls, indicators, and terminals occupies a two-story room in the Thinkers\u2019 Foundation, in which the President and members of his cabinet are waiting. It is described as many times more intelligent than humans, and was built by the Thinkers despite the skepticism of cyberneticists and scientists. The president, his secretary, two generals, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Space regard Maizie with reverence, speaking in hushed tones for fear that it could overhear them despite the knowledge that it only receives input from the ticker tape fed to it. Jorj enters onto the tape questions from the officials, before noticing an errant question, which he learns is from Morton Opperly\u2019s group of physicists. He feeds the tape to Maizie, which begins to emit a noise indicative of the start of its processes.\nAs they await Maizie\u2019s answers, Jorj directs their attention to a television screen broadcasting the launch of a rocket to Mars. We learn that Martians have imparted profound wisdom through the Thinkers to the world, which still suffers from the effects of the third world war. In response to the President\u2019s wish that Martians be brought to Earth to directly share their mental science, Jorj reminds him that only the Thinkers\u2019 minds can safely interact with the Martians\u2019. \nThe narrator reveals that inside Maizie is, rather than complicated machinery etching the edges of molecules to store information, a man who manually answers the input questions. He pauses when he reaches the question from Opperly\u2019s group, which asks if Maizie stands for Maelzel. He types out a response in the negative and continues. It is also revealed that the rocket launched for Mars only travels acutely beyond the ionosphere, rather than to its advertised destination. The astronaut, who is accompanied by his cat, reads about the knowledge which he would pass off as Martian wisdom upon his descent to Earth. \nMaizie has returned the output tape, and the Secretary of Space wonders aloud who Maelzel is. One of the generals recalls that it is from a story about a chess automaton inside which was actually a man. They dismiss Opperly\u2019s group as confused. \nIn Opperly\u2019s residence however, Opperly and Willard Farquar discuss the Thinkers\u2019 deception. Though Farquar aims to reveal the sham, Opperly is unsure he will succeed, citing that people want to be told what they wish were true.

The place is crowded with many men because Dynamopolis is experiencing a power shortage, and they would freeze outside. Burshis, the owner of the bar, gives Ryd a free drink and explains that a ship from Mars just brought power back. He is expecting there to be a big boom in the economy soon, which will lead to jobs for people like Ryd. Ryd is not easily convinced of this good news. \nThe ugly and tall man sitting next to Ryd recognizes him. Once outside, Mury introduces himself and asks Ryd if he wants to make some money. He explains that he can offer Ryd a comeback. Ryd has been jobless for ten years, but before that he was a helio operator. Since then, Mars has become fully independent, and all the work moved there. Mury says that he is working for the hundreds of men who have been put out by the corrupt government on Mars. Although Ryd and all the other Earthmen have been told that the new power cylinder being installed will create jobs and bring back the power, Mury argues that isn\u2019t truly the case. He insists that Earthmen are essentially slaves to Mars\u2019s landowners, and in order to stop that from happening, they must stop the power cylinder from landing on Earth. \nThe two men arrive at Pi Mesa, and Mury kills a guard. Ryd steals his clothing and his flame pistol so that they can get on the ship unnoticed. Ryd must pretend to be a guard escorting Mury, the Poligerent of Dynamopolis aboard the Shahrazad. The two men sneak into the controlled area through a metal door, make it to the Communications Tower, and speak with a guard. Mury offers to show his credentials as Poligerent, and surprises the guard with a punch to the gut. Mury takes the officer\u2019s gun, points it at him, and demands he accompany them. \n\nRyd nervously points his flame pistol at the guard and drops his weapon. The weapon goes off and its flame hits some machinery. This gives the pilot pause, and Mury hurries to the control room and takes over the situation. There are three workers there who become his hostages. He explains to the men that he\u2019s taking Shahrazad into space to meet the power shell. \n\nWhen the ship takes off, Ryd passes out from the pressure of the acceleration. When he wakes, Mury assures him that they are on the right path, somewhere near the orbit of the Moon.

The city is flooded with searchlights, although there is very little power to go around. The Terrestrials must gather at the local bar, Stumble Inn, if they do not want to freeze to death. At one point, Dynamopolis was a wealthy city, known as the Port of Ten Thousand Ships. About ten years ago, the Power Company of North America and the Triplanet Freighting Company were shut down, and the majority of the Terrestrials lost their jobs. The only people with political power are the Poligerents, and unless a Terrestrial knows one of them, he or she is likely left without a way to make ends meet. The Terrestrials were recently told that the power will be restored once the power shell is put on Earth. The air is thin, but the Terrestrials have become accustomed to it.\n\nPi Mesa is the spaceport that hovers over the city. There are still unused ships hovering there from the days where it was an important port with lots of action. Just outside of Pi Mesa there are hundreds of low buildings that are abandoned because they are no longer useful. They contain fuel pumps and servicing equipment, and they serve as a constant reminder of the life the Terrestrials once lived. \n\nWhen Ryd and Mury break into the land patrolled by the guards in blue in the spaceport, they find narrow passages, spiral staircases, and cool metal walls covered in dust. The Communications Tower is nearby, and it is guarded by signal-men.  The soldier robots that are on patrol are about as tall as the average Terrestrial, and they are scarlet colored. They are unarmed and are mostly there to scare intruders away. \n\nMury and Ryd aim to get on a ship called Shahrazad, which rests on the Number Two Runway, waiting for takeoff. When they enter the ship, they find that the cabin is very hot and full of dials and needles. There is a curved control panel in front, and the ship makes a humming sound because of all of the air-purifiers onboard. \n\nMars is an important setting in the story, although the characters do not actually travel there. Mars is almost airless, so it is very easy to run a helio-dynamic engine. On Mars, they use robots for labor, and due to a law that has been passed, Terrestrials are forced to stay on Earth. \n", "reviews": [{"annotations": [{"annotation": ["This whole summary did a great job of cohesively explaining all key settings in the story and provides an excellent level of detail."], "selection": "The story takes place in Dynamopolis,"}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "8", "correctness-rating": 100, "selection-rating": 100, "overall-rating": 100, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}, {"annotations": [{"annotation": ["comma"], "selection": "l m"}, {"annotation": ["hyphen"], "selection": "et co"}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "6", "correctness-rating": 90, "selection-rating": 100, "overall-rating": 97, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}, {"annotations": [{"annotation": [], "selection": "Power Company of North America and the Triplanet Freighting Company"}, {"annotation": ["Incorrect\n"], "selection": "The air is thin, but the Terrestrials have become accustomed to it."}, {"annotation": ["Dressed in scarlet-colored uniforms."], "selection": "are scarlet colored"}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "2", "correctness-rating": 96, "selection-rating": 97, "overall-rating": 98, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}], "overall": {"correctness-rating": 95.33333333333333, "selection-rating": 99.0, "overall-rating": 98.33333333333333, "correctness-ranking": 1, "selection-ranking": 1, "overall-ranking": 1}}}, "2": {"bart": {"response": "M, and the crew of the ship from Mars.

He mentions that he has found a lot of interesting artifacts, including a set of spheroid towers, a set with a spheropod, and a set made of metal. He finds a metal door that is half filled with dust and cobwebs, and he uses it to crawl out of the rubble. He sees a man with webbed feet, who he assumes is the original owner of the ruins. He asks the man to leave, but the man refuses. He says that he is the only one who knows what the city is like, and that he will tell him if he ever returns. He then tells Michaelson that he must leave, because the city has been here for half a century. He tells him that the people of the old city are not actually native, and are not able to leave. He also tells him about the people who live there, and how they are not happy with the state of the planet. He explains that they are a people from the fifth planet of the system, and they have been here to gather information about the new planet that will be built on the planet of Alpha Centauri II. He shows the native the ruins, and tells him to leave the city. The native is angry, and says that the city was a perfect place for them to live. He wants to return to, but he is afraid of the unknown. He leaves the city and goes to the bar, where he meets a man named Karsh, who tells him he is a native. He informs him that he was the last man to see the city alive, and the man is a foreigner. He has been there for a long time, and has no idea why he is still alive.

He is approached by a short, gray-haired native with webbed bare feet (aka webfoot or Maota) that he spotted in a doorway, who introduces himself as the keeper of the city and implores him to leave because he angers the gods. Michaelson brushes aside that spirits exist, but notes that he must keep an eye on this intelligent native.\nAs Michaelson continues to explore the city and disobey what he was told, the native again demands he leave, calling him \u201cMr. Earthgod.\u201d Michaelson learns his name is Maota, and tries to negotiate to preserve the artifacts and build a museum. Maota does not succumb to Michaelson\u2019s tactics, and whacks him unconscious with a metal book.\nMichaelson awakes and teleports to a creek 500 miles away to clean his wound, then returns and opens the book to find voices talking to him. He is mystified that the civilization here said to have disappeared half a million years ago was communicating with him. In his wonder, he picks up another clock-like artifact he has been curious about, and is shocked to feel it is radiating heat.\nThe next day, Michaelson awakes in the dead city to find Maota pointing a gun-like weapon at him - apologizing for causing him pain instead of killing him. Maota reads from the talking poetry book, at Michaelson\u2019s request. It moves them both, Michaelson feeling the humanity of the civilization, and Maota feeling the gentle spirits. Maota becomes furious that Michaelson wants to move things into a museum and begins to fire the weapon.

Michaelson tries to bury him, but has the sense that his soul is elsewhere. Michaelson desperately studies the artifacts to understand the clock, then radically decides to just press the button too. Afterwards, he sees his dead body below him and communicates with Maota\u2019s consciousness in a spiritual dimension.

His mother forces him to stay, and he reluctantly begins shakily sponging the wound of a victim missing half of their face with water. He accidentally drops the sponge and plunges his fingers into the wound, disgusting him greatly. His mother notices immediately that Kevin has healed the wounds completely without scarring. This is the first discovery of Kevin\u2019s psi-power of healing, and he is the only person on Earth to have this ability.

An intelligent implanted machine able to detect and interpret physiological data of nearby individuals, which Cassal calls Dimanche, tells him that the man likely intends to murder him. Dimanche gathers that the assassin's motivation is connected to Cassal\u2019s being stranded on Godolph; Cassal had initially meant to stay in Godolph for only a couple days before continuing his journey to Tunney 21, but has been stuck there for several weeks. \nCassal moves closer to the man in order for Dimanche to better analyze him; Dimanche reveals that the man wields a concealed knife. Instructing Cassal to turn into an alley, Dimanche learns that the man expressed regret about having to kill Cassal, saying that one of them had to die.

Dimanche guides Cassal, whose eyes are unable to see in the dim Godolphian light, in a fight against the man, and Cassal seemingly dispatches the man.

Through a screen, he speaks with Murra Foray, who asks that he complete an onboarding questionnaire. He answers all the required questions, except for one which asks for his purpose in traveling to Tunney. We learn that Cassal aims to persuade a Tunnesian scientist to come to Earth in order to develop instantaneous radio, which would make them very wealthy. \n\tMurra reveals that the transport for which Cassal had been waiting had departed that morning, and that a man named Denton Cassal had been aboard it. Cassal concludes that his assailant from the previous night had stolen his identification tab with the intention of traveling to Tunney 21.

However, Cassal is wary of Murra\u2019s line of questioning and reveals nothing. \n\tAs Cassal leaves the counseling room, he runs into the old man changing the signs, who reveals that Murra has recently assumed control of the Bureau.

Meanwhile, he wonders about the source of the energy for the Barden Beam, as Garrett doesn\u2019t have power plants on the planet, nor is there running water to generate hydroelectric power. Suddenly, Star notices one of Garrett\u2019s soldiers and ambushes him. \nStar Blade, who has earned the nickname Death Star for his fighting prowess, dispatches his fist adversary, and soon after notices another: a beautiful, dark-haired woman. She confronts him, calling him a pirate. He dismisses this accusation, and asserts his identity, but she does not believe him. A brief fight ensues, but is quickly settled when Star is struck by another combatant.\nAs Star wakes in a cell, he is confronted by Devil Garrett\u2019s face, Garrett\u2019s underlings, and the dark-haired woman. Garrett, who has assumed Star Blade\u2019s identity in order to trick the woman whom he calls Miss Hinton, announces that he will shortly execute Blade, whom he has tricked Hinton into believing is himself. \nStar is brought before a transmitter which only transmits images.

Anne tells Star that Garrett has discovered a method of electrolyzing water into its elemental constituents, which Star speculates to be a potential source of energy. \nSuddenly, Garrett enters the room and leads Anne and Star to a cavernous room at gunpoint. The room is full of vats and machinery, which Star concludes are the reaction vessels in which water is electrolyzed and the energy generated. Garrett reveals that his plan is to use his technology to construct many Barden Beams in order to take over the planet. \nStar removes an obscured weapon, and dispatches Devil Garrett. He quickly takes out two more pirates, before two more surrender. Commander Weddel appears, and Star reveals that his damaging the transmitter resulted in a distress signal being sent out.\nThe story concludes with Anna asking how soon the technology discovered by Garrett can be used to bring life to Alpha Centauri III, and her asking him if it would be a good place to honeymoon. \n", "reviews": [{"annotations": [{"annotation": [], "selection": "has"}, {"annotation": [], "selection": "deep stagnant"}, {"annotation": [], "selection": "ry,"}, {"annotation": [], "selection": "on, a"}, {"annotation": ["repeat"], "selection": "in order to trick the woman whom he calls Miss Hinton, announces that he will shortly execute Blade, whom he has tricked Hinton into believing is himself."}, {"annotation": [], "selection": "Garrett"}, {"annotation": [], "selection": "on,"}, {"annotation": [], "selection": "nna"}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "6", "correctness-rating": 90, "selection-rating": 90, "overall-rating": 95, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}, {"annotations": [{"annotation": ["Incorrect"], "selection": "which only transmits images"}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "2", "correctness-rating": 98, "selection-rating": 71, "overall-rating": 86, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}, {"annotations": [{"annotation": [], "selection": "fist"}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "8", "correctness-rating": 100, "selection-rating": 100, "overall-rating": 100, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}], "overall": {"correctness-rating": 96.0, "selection-rating": 87.0, "overall-rating": 93.66666666666667, "correctness-ranking": 1, "selection-ranking": 1, "overall-ranking": 1}}}, "1": {"bart": {"response": "Garrett is the leader of the space pirates, and the most feared in the universe.

The Space room is where the performers of the Marsport local orchestra play, and the bar is where they meet the new member of their orchestra, a man named Ke-teeli. The story begins with Ke-tteeli, the Marsports boss, coming to see his bass man, who is out of town. He is upset because he has called the Mars port local for another man, and he is worried that the new man won't be able to come because the man is not yet hired. The man, named Keel, is a foreigner, and his job is to play the bass for the orchestra. The group of spacemen are playing for the new guy, and they are nervous about him. They are playing a piece called \"Holes and John Smith\" and it is a slow song, but the man, Keel is singing it anyway. The music is beautiful, and it seems that the man who is playing it is famous, but he is not. The other man, a Martian named Don, is playing the tuba, and Keel asks him to play it for them. The two men are nervous because they have never played together before, and are unfamiliar with each other. The new man, the man named Skaw, is tall, thin, and tall, and skinny.

Now that a member is missing and the replacement player has not yet arrived, the boss starts to doubt that the three members of the band can perform good music. He doesn\u2019t think that the customers will be satisfied. The band\u2019s contract with the boss ends this week, and the boss does not seem to want to continue the contract. Finally, the temporary bass fiddle player arrives with his instrument. He introduces himself as John Smith and tells them that he is late because he was working on his plan. At first, Jimmie doubt that the ancient bass fiddle can make any beautiful sound. But he becomes very surprised once he hears the beautiful music. The audiences are focused and intrigued by the music. Even the boss becomes delight after hearing the music. Later, John begins to notice the holes on the clarinet and the piano, which seems quite odd to the band. Noting his talents in music and the facial expression on the boss\u2019 face, Jimmie asks John to play for the long term. But John rejects stating that he needs to work on his plan. John mentions that there are many holes in the universe, but he cannot find the right one to go back to prove a point to the University. Believing that Jimmie understands him, he decides to play with the band. The boss agrees to give them the contract if John stays. For the next few days, John becomes popular and then a reporter come to interview him. After telling the reporter about the holes, the reporter decides to leave. Then John tells the band that he will stay until tomorrow. The next day, John is gone. The band searched everywhere, but is not able to find him.

Herbert despises the way his wife looks at him, and he imagines her denigrating him as a gold-digger with nothing to offer a woman, so he privately purchases a telporter suit--a thin, mesh body cover that can be worn under one's clothes and is used to transport the wearer's \"shadowy self\" to a receiver previously set in secret. While he believes his wife is watching a sex-opera using her telovis (a 3-D imaging device), Herbert engages the telporter and transports himself to a cabin situated between a highway and a river. There, he changes clothes and walks to the Riverside Club (a place where owners of telporter suits can gather to escape their dreary outer lives) where he plans to meet a girl he had met the previous night. Because telporting oneself is illegal, rooms at the club are very expensive in order to cover the costs of police protection and Herbert cannot afford a private room there with the allowance his wife gives him. The club is colorful and full of costumed, masked partyers, dancing together and drinking champagne. Herbert purchases a bottle of whiskey because he cannot afford the expensive champagne. As Herbert drinks, he becomes more relaxed and confident, and he watches a woman dressed in a Persian costume dancing with a man dressed as a bullfighter. Soon after, the bullfighter disappears, and Herbert is reminded that sometimes people at the club vanish suddenly when there is a threat they will be discovered in their outer lives. He also notices a scar on his hand and is reminded that when someone's shadow self is injured, their outer husk retains the feeling of pain but not the scar. Herbert dances with the Persian-costumed woman and becomes steadily more intoxicated by drink and by the atmosphere of revelry. Eventually, he finds the girl he had met the night before, recognizing her by her long, stockinged legs. She wears a platinum wig, a white mask, and green contact lenses, and they dance together and kiss. The drunker Herbert becomes, the more insecure he feels about his ability to satisfy the woman, and he begins lashing out at her, accidentally revealing his plans to kill his wife in order to take her money so he can start a new life with the mysterious woman. The woman laughs at him, and she withdraws a gun from her purse and shoots Herbert twice--once in the heart and then in the head. The woman is actually Mrs. Herbert Hyrel, and she has been using her own telporter suit to expose Herbert and dispose of him herself. Because Herbert\u2019s gunshot wounds do not transfer with his shadowy self back to his outer body, it appears as if Herbert simply died.

He is approached by a girl named Tako, who introduces herself as a friend and asks him to kill a man, Gurn, who he thinks is the renegade leader of the bandits. He tells her that he is a renegade from the planet Sarna and that he killed a man called Gurn last night. He then tells her about his mission to destroy the people of the moon and their planet, and she asks him why he is on the moon. He explains that he has been exiled from his home planet, Earth, and is now a fugitive from the authorities. He asks her to kill Gurn and the other men, and he tells her he is writing a novel about his experience. He also tells her the story of the time he was captured by the bandits and brought to the moon, and how he was given a new identity as a hunter. He says he is the only one who knows how to hunt and kills, and that the other people on the planet are afraid of him. He wants to destroy them all, and the only way he can do that is to write his novel. He begins to write the story in the language of the people on this moon, which is the language that he speaks to the girl, and then switches to the language he speaks in the jungle, which he calls the \"Vasad\". He tells the girl that he was exiled from Earth, but that he now speaks the language spoken by the people, and they are afraid to speak to him. The girl asks him questions, and Noork replies that he does not speak to them, but he does speak to the woman, who asks him if he is human. He replies that no, but is a fugitive. He goes to the headquarters of the supervising council, where he meets Tholon, who tells him that he will be the new governor of the new moon. Noork is pleased to hear this news, and asks Tholon to appoint him governor. He meets the woman who is the wife of the leader of a nearby planet, who informs him that the planet is inhabited by humans, and has been for the past ten thousand years. He informs her that the people who live on the new planet are called the \"vans\", and that they are the people that killed the last man on the old planet, Gurs, and are now trying to destroy it. He reveals that he had been exiled to the new world because he killed the man who killed Gurs and the woman he was with, and now he is trying to find a way to destroy all of them.

The story then goes to the location of the Temple of the Skull, a large, domed structure with a central raised altar and an inscription that reads \"Sacred to the Most Powerful of All Gods\" in gold and silver embroidery. There are three distinct levels of the structure, each with its own priest and high priest. The upper levels are forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island, and the lower levels are where the prisoners are kept. The lower levels have a door that leads to a wide stone-slabbed entry within the jagged jaw of the bowl of the Lake of Uzdon, and there is an opening at the top of the opening that leads into a wide, slabbed landing area. The landing area is filled with thick jungle with jagged lowlands that extend upward to a thousand feet in the distance. The trees that line the edge of the lowlands are thickets. The jagged fringe of the jungle extend up to a high, rocky cliff that is topped with a thin, jagged peak. The peaks are topped with petrified logs.", "reviews": [{"annotations": [{"annotation": ["the second moon of a planet, I think - Luna should be the first moon"], "selection": "the small moon of the planet of Luna"}, {"annotation": ["This isn't what happened, but also, he *is* the young American pilot"], "selection": "He is then taken to the nearby city of Grath, where he meets the Doctor and the young American pilot."}, {"annotation": ["Not sure where this quotation came from"], "selection": "Sacred to the Most Powerful of All Gods\" in gold and silver embroidery."}, {"annotation": ["Not sure where this detail came from"], "selection": "The peaks are topped with petrified logs."}], "system": "bart-dpr", "worker_id": "3", "correctness-rating": 75, "selection-rating": 75, "overall-rating": 75, "correctness-rank": 2, "selection-rank": 2, "overall-rank": 2}, {"annotations": [{"annotation": ["repeat"], "selection": "jagged,"}, {"annotation": ["how can a valley be dotted with valleys?

Some trees are over forty feet tall; Noork uses these trees to surveil the area around him. Several groups live on Sekk in different villages, and there are dangerous wild animals called spotted narls. There is a mysterious group of beings, believed to be demons, called the Misty Ones because they are invisible. They live on an island in the middle of a lake and have a huge skull that represents their god, Uzdon. Female slaves are held captive in a pit beneath the skull. The story takes place after World War II, when the Allies were searching for Nazi officers to stand trial for their war crimes. Dr. Karl Von Mark is one of the Nazi officials, and he makes his way to Africa, pursued by the American Stephen Dietrich.

He calls Jeff Mr. Elliot although Jeff has not given the stranger his name. This gives Jeff the slightest sense of hesitation, but Ann is eager to go with Snader.\n\nAnn and Jeff follow Snader to the station, which turns out to be a reasonably-sized home in a residential neighborhood.

They step into a screen and jump out a few moments later. When they walk through the same door they entered, the surroundings are different, and Jeff\u2019s car has been replaced by a limousine.

The ship is headed to Venus and Earth, and the captain has ordered all passengers to board at their own risk. The captain explains that the ship is a suicide run, a coffin ship, which is illegal, and there is no way for the passengers to get off the ship. Shano agrees to board the ship at the earliest possible moment, and he is told that he is to stay on the ship for ten minutes, and then he will be escorted to the emergency oxygen room. The story then moves to the control room, where Shano is informed that the captain is hurt, and they have to find a way to get him back to Earth. They go to the engine room, and Shano notices that the air quality is very bad. The room is very hot, but cool, so he uses a lighter to cool down the room. Inside, he sees an indistinct figure with a beard, and it turns out to be the ship's engineer, Taggart. He tells Shano that he has been working on this ship for a long time, and has a reputation for being a daredevil.   Shano tries to escape the room, but the room is locked, so the ship has to be towed back to the airlock. He uses a knife to cut through the door, but it doesn't work. He is able to get through, and escapes the room with his hands. He finds himself in the emergency airlock, but he is unable to breathe. He hears a scream from the other side of the door. He tries to run, but his hands get burned by the heat, and his body is freezing cold. He realizes that he must have been in the room for a while, and runs out of air. He wakes up in a hospital bed, where he finds a doctor, who tells him that he had been in a fight with the enemy. The doctor also tells him about the rumors about the man who cut himself, and sold himself to the Uranians. The man died of lung-rot, and had to be buried alive.

Many guests leave after hearing the danger signal, but Shano sticks his ticket into the scanner and moves to get on the liner. Shano chooses to step in anyways despite the dangers, and the Stardust takes off into space again. Captain Menthlo informs him of the Uranian enemy fleets and the high possibility of running into danger with one of them. When the captain realizes Shano's role as a laborer, he makes him sign a waiver because of the possible danger his life will be when they shut off the ship and mechanical device to avoid the enemies.

Later, as Shano smokes in his cabin, he tries to remember the specific saying for people with nicked jaws. Later, the ship announces that it will now maintain dead silence mode to avoid the Uranian fleets. Shano leaves his room to follow one of the young ensign, who walks by with a blaster. He then realizes that he cannot go back to his room. However, he sees an indistinguishable figure enter the engine room and notices a grey box with switches. Not soon after, the ship enters an offensive attack mode because the Uranian fleets have noticed them. Shano suddenly remembers the rumors to watch out for a man with a nicked jaw because he sells out information to Uranus. He knows that nobody will believe him about a traitor on the ship, so he faces Rourke himself. Shano digs his cigarette into the other man's body and clings to his body. He then twists Rourke's neck with his hands and kills the traitor. The frantic yelling of the other members catches his attention again, and the Stardust informs everybody on board that the ship is midway to Venus. However, there is toxic gas in the engine room now, and nobody on board can withstand the fumes to fix the engines. Although Shano continues to smoke, he does go into the engine room through the emergency exit to fix the space liner. The other crew on the ship are confused by how the liner continues to fly towards Venus. They realize that Shano is working the valve rods in the engine room. Shano thinks about how the Uranian fleet will come into the area and expect to find the Starliner but only find nothing. The fact that this escape is because of him makes him laugh and cough more.

Shano\u2019s bravery is also shown when he braves the toxic gas to save the liner. He knows that he can last for up to 12 hours at most and that he will most likely die on the trip home. However, this does not deter him if he can get the ship safely to Venus. While Shano\u2019s occupation in the story is not regarded highly, his actions show that he should not be underestimated.

He also tells Retief that he is not allowed to interfere with the Fuhs\u2019 affairs because he has no diplomatic immunity. Retieve is upset and tries to explain to Magnan that he has a better idea than the one he was given. Magnan is skeptical and says that he does not want to hear Retief out.

Magnan specifically suggests that Retief sponsor the group SCARS (Sexual, Cultural and Athletic Recreational Society), and warns Retief that the rival Groaci may fill any void. Retief suggests researching the youth groups before giving them money. Magnan is dismissive. Retief is still not interested, and leaves to go look at plans for a new passenger liner being built by the Fustians. \nRetief takes a flat-car to the ship yard and meets Whonk, who is a shipyard clerk. He asks to see the blueprints, which he photographs. He and Whonk chat about the attitude of the youth, and Whonk blames it on their new leader, Slock, who hangs around with Yith, a member of the Groaci embassy.\nLater, while Retief is on his way home to dress for a dinner and press event organized by Magnan, two Fustian youths threaten him on the bus. Retief realizes that they were after his photos, which showed that the ship under construction was a battle cruiser, not a passenger liner. He also realizes that Whonk may be in danger. Retief escapes the youths and races back to the shipyard to find that Whonk has been dragged off and tied up in a warehouse. From the Fustian\u2019s wounds, Retief realized that they had tried to kill him.\nRetief figures out that the Fustian youths have taken some titanite, an explosive, over to a ship called the Moss Rock, which would be full of dignitaries later. He and Whonk race over there and encounter more Fustians, and win a fight with them, effectively breaking up the Groaci-backed plot to blow up the ship. \nRetief arrives at the banquet a little late, and exchanges a few words with Magnan, who proceeds to make the Fustians miserable with his cultural insensitivity. A few minutes later, the SCARS leader, Slock, arrives. Retief reveals Slock\u2019s plan: Slock, backed by the Groaci, was planning to take over Fust. The Groaci tried to frame the Terrestrial Embassy for the plot.\nSlock escaped. Retief went back toward the Moss Rock, where Whonk tackled Slock, and Retief accosted Yith. Whonk wanted to take revenge on Yith for attacking him earlier, but Retief instead negotiated a deal in which Yith, who had mastered removing the Fustian carapace surgically, which would be a great relief to Whonk and other elders, would agree to do so in return for not being ritually dismembered. Just as this agreement was completed, Slock tried to escape again, but Whonk dumped him on the Moss Rock, and set the autopilot for Groaci, still full of titanite. It blew up on the way there.\nMagnan wrested what he could, diplomatically speaking, from the wreckage of the youth sponsorship program and moved on to plans to sponsor Senior Citizens Groups.\n", "reviews": [{"annotations": [], "system": "human", "worker_id": "2", "correctness-rating": 51, "selection-rating": 5, "overall-rating": 7, "correctness-rank": 2, "selection-rank": 2, "overall-rank": 2}, {"annotations": [], "system": "human", "worker_id": "8", "correctness-rating": 100, "selection-rating": 95, "overall-rating": 100, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}, {"annotations": [{"annotation": ["would be clearer if we were reminded who this was"], "selection": "Yith."}, {"annotation": ["could discuss retief's role here too and his plans with whonk"], "selection": "moved on to plans to sponsor Senior Citizens Groups."}], "system": "human", "worker_id": "3", "correctness-rating": 100, "selection-rating": 100, "overall-rating": 100, "correctness-rank": 1, "selection-rank": 1, "overall-rank": 1}], "overall": {"correctness-rating": 83.66666666666667, "selection-rating": 66.66666666666667, "overall-rating": 69.0, "correctness-ranking": 1, "selection-ranking": 1, "overall-ranking": 1}}}, "1": {"bart": {"response": "The Fustians are a long-lived people, which is reflected in their culture and their physical appearance.

We know there must be oceans, because the warehouse where Wonk was tied up and left was full of bales of kelp, a sea product. The city of the story is also near a sea, whose breezes make it a bit cool at certain times of day.\nThe city where all the action takes place is an important city, perhaps the capitol. It is full of diplomatic missions from all planets, and is apparently a place of some Fustian learning and culture, given that it has musicians for hire. There is a space ship building operation right outside the city, which can be reached by public transport that consists of flat open wagons. This is practical for the unwieldy shape of the adult Fustian, if not too comfortable for a human.\nOne of the most interesting things about Fust, and the hardest for an outsider to understand, is their assorted suns and moons. Fust is lit by a blue sun called Alpha and a yellow sun known as Beta, and three moons orbit Fust.
