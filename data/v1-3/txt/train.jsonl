I\nfancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the\nwisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two\nweeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n \n  \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of\nweeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure\nto bear.\"\n \n  \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even\nyou to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may\nbe the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more\ncultivated channels.\"\n \n  \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,\nglancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n \n  Magnan nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military\ncampaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of\nthe Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that\nprecedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\"\n \n  \"Breaking and entering,\" Retief said. \"You may have something there.\nBut I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial\nworld of the poor but honest variety.\"\n \n  \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"\nMagnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together. See\nthat you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will\nbe an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic\nrestraint—not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\n \n  A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n \n  \"That—bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk\nscreen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n \n  \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"\nMagnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here\nat Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n \n  \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n \n  Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's\nbutton.\n \n  \"Send the bucolic person in.\"\nA tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers\nof heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,\nstepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at\nsight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held\nout his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face\nto face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n \n  Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n \n  \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his\nhand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I\nstarted it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n \n  \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n \n  \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were\nall ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.\nWhat I wanted to see you about was—\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,\nout on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just\nabout ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't\nknow if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n \n  \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.\nArapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,\npuffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,\nthe vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.\nWe like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.\nApples the size of a melon—and sweet—\"\n \n  \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and\nEducation Division come in?\"\n \n  Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks\ncan't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the\nland area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable\nforest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.\nRetief.\"\n \n  \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what—\"\n \n  \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our\nyear's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric\norbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly\npainting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.\nLots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for\nwoodworkers. Our furniture—\"\n \n  \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n \n  Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil\nand those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then\ncomes the Monsoon. Rain—it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting\ncloser. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?\nThat's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay\ninside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach\non Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.\nThe theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have\nthe music and the surf and the bonfires and stars—we're close to the\ncenter of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n \n  \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n \n  \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the\nordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't\ntake long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new\nplaces ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a\nlot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this\nyear's different. This is Wine Year.\"\nArapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine\ncrop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going.\nBut this year....\"\n \n  \"The crop isn't panning out?\"\n \n  \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only\ntwenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's\nnot the crop.\"\n \n  \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the\nCommercial—\"\n \n  \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever\nsettled for anything else!\"\n \n  \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have\nto try them some time.\"\n \n  Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No\ntime like the present,\" he said.\n \n  Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both\ndusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\n \n  \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said.\n \n  \"This isn't\ndrinking\n. It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire\nretainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the\nair. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.\n\"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked.\n \n  Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come\nto think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint\nnative customs.\"\n \n  Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep\nrust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked\nat Arapoulous thoughtfully.\n \n  \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted\nport.\"\n \n  \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a\nmouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus\nwine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second\nbottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine\nand black.\"\nRetief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,\ncaught it as it popped up.\n \n  \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You\nprobably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years\nback?\"\n \n  \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two\nfresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n \n  \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,\nswallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.\nWe like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a\nforce. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than\nwe did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.\nBut it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n \n  \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\nbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n \n  \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow\nmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\nexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\nyou're doing it for strangers.\"\n \n  \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief\nsaid. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n \n  \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\nwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\nturn over to machinery—and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\nseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\nFirst, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\ncovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\nhere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\ngrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\nto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on\nwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\nand it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\nthe tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\nroast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\nfruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\ndone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\nfor the best crews.\n \n  \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\nfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\nget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\nborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\ntoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\nof grape juice?\"\n\"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after\na vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time—\"\n \n  \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\"\n \n  \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief\nsaid.\n \n  \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad.\nWe've got a bumper crop—and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big\nvintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then\nnext vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage—\"\n \n  \"You hocked the vineyards?\"\n \n  \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\"\n \n  \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red\nis hard to beat....\"\n \n  \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan\nto see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd\nrepay it in sculpture, painting, furniture—\"\n \n  \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling\nside-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci\nnose-flute players—\"\n \n  \"Can they pick grapes?\"\n \n  \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over\nwith the Labor Office?\"\n \n  \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics\nspecialists and computer programmers we wanted—but no field hands.\nSaid it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought\nI was trying to buy slaves.\"\n \n  The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\n \n  \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then\nafterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\"\n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he\nsaid. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.\nCheck with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles\nhere. Cultural exhibits, you know.\"\nII\n \n  As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague\nacross the table.\n \n  \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.\nWhat are they getting?\"\n \n  Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over\nat MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the\nsole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and\nExchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's no harm in\ntelling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\"\n \n  \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\"\n \n  \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,\nblinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE\ninterested in MEDDLE's activities?\"\n \n  \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up\nearlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over\non—\"\n \n  \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient\nproblems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\"\n \n  \"Speaking of tractors,\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special\nCommittee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'\nGeneral Economies have been trying for months to get a request for\nmining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE—\"\n \n  \"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\" Whaffle said. \"First come, first\nserved. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\" He strode\noff, briefcase under his arm.\n \n  \"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\" the SCROUNGE committeeman\nsaid. \"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out\nto pacify her. While my chance to make a record—that is, assist\npeace-loving d'Land—comes to naught.\" He shook his head.\n \n  \"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're\nsending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an\ninstitution.\"\n \n  \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\"\n \n  \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\"\n \n  \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two\nhundred\nstudents would overtax the\nfacilities of the college.\"\n \n  \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\"\n \n  \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise\ntrade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students\nindeed!\" He snorted and walked away.\nRetief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the\nelevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a\ncab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them\nlined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half\nan hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and\nordered a beer.\n \n  A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\n \n  \"Happy days,\" he said.\n \n  \"And nights to match.\"\n \n  \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.\nYep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place\nwaiting....\"\n \n  \"You meeting somebody?\"\n \n  \"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect—Never mind. Have one on\nme.\"\n \n  \"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\"\n \n  \"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know—\" he turned\nto Retief—\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped.\n\"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\"\n \n  \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\"\n \n  The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\"\n \n  \"I represent MUDDLE.\"\n \n  Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of\nan advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like\na game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under\npressure. If I had my old platoon—\"\n \n  He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So\nlong, friend. Or are you coming along?\"\n \n  Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\"\nAt the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of\nthe Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to\nattention, his chest out.\n \n  \"Drop that, mister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to\nact?\"\n \n  The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\n \n  \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to\ntown? We fellas were thinking—\"\n \n  \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now\nline up!\"\n \n  \"We have quarters ready for the students,\" Retief said. \"If you'd like\nto bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid\non.\"\n \n  \"Thanks,\" said Karsh. \"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't\nhave the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about\ngoing over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\"\n \n  \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long\nwait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\"\n \n  \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He\nhiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\"\n \n  \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\"\n \n  \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\"\n \n  \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\"\n \n  \"Sure,\" Karsh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh\nwinked. \"And bring a few beers.\"\n \n  \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging\nfrom Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female\nstudents?\"\n \n  \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch\nis received.\"\n \n  Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\n \n  \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound\nfor?\"\n \n  \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\"\n \n  \"Would that be the Technical College?\"\n \n  Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these\ndetails.\"\n \n  \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief\nsaid. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are\ntravelling so far to study—at Corps expense.\"\n \n  \"Mr. Magnan never—\"\n \n  \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves\nme with the question of two thousand young male students headed for\na world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.\nBut the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation\nto Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on\nLovenbroy.\"\n \n  \"Well!\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.\n\"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\"\n \n  \"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\" Retief said. \"But\nnever mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors\nwill Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\"\n \n  \"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\" Miss Furkle said. \"Mr. Magnan\nalways—\"\n \n  \"I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can.\"\nMiss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the\noffice, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps\nLibrary. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over\nindices.\n \n  \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\n \n  \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a\nmining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\"\n \n  \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said.\n\"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit\nsection lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged\nit into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored\nvehicle.\n \n  \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental\nsiege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\"\n \n  \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want\nis a tractor. Model WV M-1—\"\n\"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for\ndemolition work. That must be what confused you.\"\n \n  \"Probably—among other things. Thank you.\"\n \n  Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. \"I have the information you\nwanted,\" she said. \"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the\nimpression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths—\"\n \n  \"Sure,\" Retief said. \"Shoot. How many tractors?\"\n \n  \"Five hundred.\"\n \n  \"Are you sure?\"\n \n  Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent—\"\n \n  \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five\nhundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\"\n \n  \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\n \n  \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said.\nIII\n \n  Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and\nhip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \"CERP\n7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\n \n  Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of\nBacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and\nsipped the black wine meditatively.\n \n  It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the\nproduction of such vintages....\n \n  Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put\nthrough a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial\nAttache.\n \n  \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment,\nthe tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show\nwe're shipping five hundred units....\"\n \n  \"That's correct. Five hundred.\"\n \n  Retief waited.\n \n  \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\"\n \n  \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred\ntractors.\"\n \n  \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle—\"\n \n  \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\"\nRetief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps\nhalf a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they\ncould handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any\nore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining\noutfit? I should think—\"\n \n  \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?\nAnd in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the\nequipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle—\"\n \n  \"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four\nhundred and ninety tractors?\"\n \n  \"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\"\n \n  \"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic\ntradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a\ngift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme\ncooking—\"\n\"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n \n  \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a\nblade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n \n  \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us\nbranded as warmongers? Frankly—is this a closed line?\"\n \n  \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n \n  \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a\ndifficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation\nto a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n \n  \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"\nRetief said. \"Any connection?\"\n \n  \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n \n  \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n \n  \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n \n  \"Who gets them?\"\n \n  \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see—\"\n \n  \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized\ntransshipment of grant material?\"\n \n  \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan\nrepresentative.\"\n \n  \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n \n  \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But\nlook here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n \n  \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang\noff, buzzed the secretary.\n \n  \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new\napplications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement\nof students.\"\n \n  \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.\nMr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n \n  \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office?

Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\nto time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n \n  \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n \n  Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n \n  \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n \n  \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n \n  \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n \n  \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked\nfor the dispatch clerk.\n \n  \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you.

Okay, I'll wait.\"\n \n  Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.\nBut there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed\nclear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n \n  \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and\ntake a look at that baggage for me.\"\n \n  Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand.

Something funny going on.\nGuns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols—\"\n \n  \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,\nI'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a\nfriend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you\nunderstand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that\nwill cover you officially.

I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\"\nIV\n \n  Karsh met Retief as he entered the Departures enclosure at the port.\n \n  \"What's going on here?\" he demanded. \"There's some funny business with\nmy baggage consignment. They won't let me see it! I've got a feeling\nit's not being loaded.\"\n \n  \"You'd better hurry, Mr. Karsh,\" Retief said. \"You're scheduled to\nblast off in less than an hour.

Those vessels aren't moving\nwithout it!\"\n \n  \"No need to get so upset about a few toothbrushes, is there, Mr.\nKarsh?\" Retief said blandly. \"Still, if you're worried—\" He turned to\nArapoulous.\n \n  \"Hank, why don't you walk Mr. Karsh over to the warehouse and ...\nah ... take care of him?\"\n \n  \"I know just how to handle it,\" Arapoulous said.\n \n  The dispatch clerk came up to Retief. \"I caught the tractor equipment,\"\nhe said. \"Funny kind of mistake, but it's okay now. They're being\noff-loaded at d'Land. I talked to the traffic controller there. He said\nthey weren't looking for any students.\"\n \n  \"The labels got switched, Jim.

A disheveled figure in a\ntight hat was crossing the enclosure, arms waving.\n \n  \"Hi there, Mr. Gulver,\" Retief called. \"How's Boge's business coming\nalong?\"\n \n  \"Piracy!\" Gulver blurted as he came up to Retief, puffing hard. \"You've\ngot a hand in this, I don't doubt!

I'll remind you, that shipment enjoys\ndiplomatic free entry!\"\n \n  \"Who told you it was impounded?\"\n \n  \"Never mind! I have my sources!\"\n \n  Two tall men buttoned into gray tunics came up. \"Are you Mr. Retief of\nCDT?\" one said.\n \n  \"That's right.\"\n \n  \"What about my baggage!\" Gulver cut in. \"And I'm warning you, if those\nships lift without—\"\n \n  \"These gentlemen are from the Armaments Control Commission,\" Retief\nsaid. \"Would you like to come along and claim your baggage, Mr. Gulver?\"\n \n  \"From where?

There's been an error....\"\nAt the baggage warehouse Gulver looked glumly at the opened cases of\nguns. \"No, of course not,\" he said dully. \"Not my baggage. Not my\nbaggage at all.\"\n \n  Arapoulous appeared, supporting the stumbling figure of Mr. Karsh.\n \n  \"What—what's this?\" Gulver spluttered. \"Karsh? What's happened?\"\n \n  \"He had a little fall. He'll be okay,\" Arapoulous said.\n \n  \"You'd better help him to the ship,\" Retief said. \"It's ready to lift.\nWe wouldn't want him to miss it.\"\n \n  \"Leave him to me!\" Gulver snapped, his eyes slashing at Karsh. \"I'll\nsee he's dealt with.\"\n \n  \"I couldn't think of it,\" Retief said. \"He's a guest of the Corps, you\nknow. We'll see him safely aboard.\"\n \n  Gulver turned, signaled frantically. Three heavy-set men in identical\ndrab suits detached themselves from the wall, crossed to the group.\n \n  \"Take this man,\" Gulver snapped, indicating Karsh, who looked at him\ndazedly, reached up to rub his head.\n \n  \"We take our hospitality seriously,\" Retief said. \"We'll see him aboard\nthe vessel.\"\n \n  Gulver opened his mouth.\n \n  \"I know you feel bad about finding guns instead of school books in\nyour luggage,\" Retief said, looking Gulver in the eye. \"You'll be busy\nstraightening out the details of the mix-up.

The\ncourse plugged into the navigators was to Lovenbroy. You'll be glad to\nknow they're still headed there—even without the baggage.\"\n \n  \"Perhaps,\" Gulver said grimly, \"perhaps they'll manage without it.\"\n \n  \"By the way,\" Retief said. \"There was another funny mix-up. There\nwere some tractors—for industrial use, you'll recall. I believe you\nco-operated with Croanie in arranging the grant through MEDDLE. They\nwere erroneously consigned to Lovenbroy, a purely agricultural world. I\nsaved you some embarrassment, I trust, Mr. Gulver, by arranging to have\nthem off-loaded at d'Land.\"\n \n  \"D'Land!

Then he snapped erect. \"Hold the\nships!\" he yelled. \"I'm canceling the student exchange—\"\n \n  His voice was drowned by the rumble as the first of the monster\ntransports rose from the launch pit, followed a moment later by the\nsecond, Retief watched them out of sight, then turned to Gulver.\n \n  \"They're off,\" he said. \"Let's hope they get a liberal education.\"\nV\n \n  Retief lay on his back in deep grass by a stream, eating grapes.

And he's also the fellow that\ngot those workers for us.\"\n \n  Delinda smiled at Retief. \"I've heard about you, Mr. Retief. We\nweren't sure about the boys at first. Two thousand Bogans, and all\nconfused about their baggage that went astray. But they seemed to like\nthe picking.\" She smiled again.\n \n  \"That's not all.

I'd have laid on\nsome kind of big welcome.\"\n \n  \"I liked the welcome I got. And I didn't have much notice. Mr. Magnan\nwas a little upset when he got back.

Magnan reminds Retief that his role is to act as a rubber stamp, continuing Magnan’s actions. Magnan points out that Retief should appreciate that Bogan is participating in the Exchange Program. Its participation might be a step toward sublimating their aggression into more cultivated channels. The Bogans are sending two thousand students to d’Land as exchange students, and Magnan thinks this might end their aggression and bring them into the cultural life of the Galaxy. Retief wonders aloud what the students will study in such a poor, industrial land. Magnan points out that this is none of Retief’s concern and that his role is simply to facilitate bringing the two groups together. When Miss Furkle, the secretary, buzzes Magnan that the bucolic person from Lovenbroy is there again, Magnan pushes the meeting off onto Retief.\n\nThe person from Lovenbroy is named Hank Arapoulous. He is a farmer and tells Retief that the Bacchus vines that they use to make their wine mature every twelve years and that this year is a harvest year, but they are short on workers to harvest the grapes. They have a shortage of workers for the harvest due to their conflict over strip mining and the loss of several of their young men in the battles to prevent it. Also, Lovenbroy had to borrow money from Croanie, and the loan was due. The wine crop will put them in the clear if they can harvest it. The biggest concern is what Croanie will do with the land if they can’t pay the loan; Lovenbroy has offered half its grape acreage as security for the loan it received. Hank asks Retief for a loan, but Retief tells him that MEDDLE’s role is only for transportation. Hank says he also checked with the Labor Office, but it only offered to set them up with machinery. \n\nRetief attends a council meeting and learns that Croanie will receive a shipment of strip mining equipment. A spokesman for the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations’ General Economies (SCROUNGE) indicates he has been trying to get mining equipment for d’Land. He tells Retief that Boge is a troublemaker, so all the agencies in the Corps are trying to appease her.

He diverts their luggage and sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy, where they help harvest the grapes. Retief is also sent to Lovenbroy for exceeding his authority.

The Bogans are sending two-thousand students to the planet D’Land, except there’s no school to accommodate them there and they’re not actually students but soldiers. They’ve also arranged to have weapons and war vehicles shipped under the guise of student baggage and tractors. Boge is using the financial leverage they have with the planet Croanie to get them to help with these shipments, and to ultimately allow the Bogans to take over Lovenbroy (a planet in debt to Lovenbroy that Boge has tried and failed to conquer in the past), D’Land, and potentially another planet.

Retief’s first order of business is dealing with Hank Arapoulous who came to MUDDLE to ask for some help harvesting the Bacchus grapes. He shares that they are indebted to Croanie, who loaned them funds after a failed invasion from the Bogans. Arapoulous is worried that the Croanie’s will be able to come in and harvest the grapes (as well as take the land) for themselves if they can’t pay the debt since they hold the mortgage on some of the acreage. After sharing some wine (alternating between red and black), Retief agrees to try and see if he can send some helping hands to Lovenbroy, Arapoulous’ home planet. \n\tRetief soon discovers that MEDDLE, another division at the Manpower Utilization Director, has authorized a shipment of 500 tractors that will be sent to Croanie. Retief questions Mr. Whaffle about it, and he explains that they are in need of heavy mining equipment. However, Croanie is mostly made up of fisheries, so there’s nothing to mine there. Retief questions other shipments as well, including the authorized transport of 2,000 Bogan students to d’Land. He discovers that there is only one technical college on d’Land and that it would be overwhelmed with just 200 transfer students. As well, Boge and d’Land have a very tense relationship; such a trade would be very rare. Sensing something fishy, Retief continues his search. \n\tOn his way to greet the incoming students, Retief stops at a bar and meets their teacher, Mr. Karsh. He describes training them as if they were in the military, not as if they were students. They leave together to meet the students. Retief arranged for a variety of fun events for the students, but Mr. Karsh shuts it all down. He simply wants to know when their luggage, flying in on a Croanie ship, will get in and when they will leave. \n\tQuickly, their plot falls apart as Retief researches these tractors and discovers they are machines built for war. After interrogating Mr. Whaffle about the shipment, he discovers that the tractors are going to Lovenbroy. He speaks to Mr. Gulver, a Bogan representative, who reveals that he just submitted an application for transportation for another 2,000 students. Retief then discovers the student’s luggage was bound for Lovenbroy and filled with army-grade weaponry. Putting it all together, Retief sends the students to Lovenbroy without their weapons, hands Mr. Karsh off to Arapoulous for a frank talking to, and sends the tractors to d’Land.

Retief reports to Second Secretary Magnan, who is taking some time off and asks Retief to manage affairs in his absence. He reminds Retief of a group of students from the planet Boge who will be traveling to the planet d’Land as part of an Exchange Program. Magnan’s hope is this program will help the warring Bogans better assimilate into the Galaxy’s culture. While he is gone, Retief meets with a man named Hank Arapoulous, who represents a planet called Lovenbroy, known for its plentiful grape harvests. Over wine, Hank requests labor to harvest the crop essential to their livelihood on Lovenbroy, and Retief learns of their connection to a planet called Croanie. Several years ago, the farmers of Lovenbroy had to defend their mineral resources against their neighbors, and they lost a lot of money and men in the process. Therefore, they had to borrow money from Croanie, and Hank is afraid they won’t be able to pay their debt on time without enough hands to harvest their grape crop. In addition, in their desperation, the farmers of Lovenbroy pawned the mortgage of their vineyards to Croanie thinking the twelve-year crop rotation would buy them enough time to pay back their debts. Retief says he will try to find a solution to his problem, and he sets about to attend the Intergroup Council and meet with the Bogan students set to depart for d’Land. At the Council meeting, he learns Croanie is set to receive a shipment of mining equipment from the Corps, and the school on d’Land set to receive the 2,000 Bogan students could hardly accommodate 200. At a bar later, Retief meets a man named Karsh, who drunkenly reveals he is training the students for something other than studying. At the library later, Retief learns that the tractors being sent to Croanie are not mining equipment, but are heavily armored with firepower. When Retief questions why so many tractors are being sent to a planet without the capacity to process them, he learns the excess will be sent to Boge. Retief deduces the entire situation is a Bogan plot to send troops to d’Land and have Croanie provide the military equipment sourced from Corps grants. Instead, Retief has representatives from Armaments confiscate the students’ luggage (which are actually filled with guns) and sends the “students” to Lovenbroy instead, where they help the farmers harvest their grape crop.

Arapoulousis explains to Retief that a few years ago, Boge landed a force on Lovenbroy to try to mine their minerals by strip-mining. Lovenbroy fought back for a year but lost a lot of its men. This created financial problems, so Lovenbroy borrowed money from Croanie, mortgaging its crops.

He is worried that if they don’t have a great harvest, Croanie will come in and start mining. Also, if they default on the loan, Croanie will hold half of the grape acreage that they used to secure the loan. Arapoulousis has also asked for help from the Labor Office, but they only offered to send them machinery, and machines cannot harvest the grapes. He returns to see Retief the following day to find out if Retief has discovered a way to help.

Spring is also pretty cold, but warm and light enough to woodwork and play a few sports. Then comes the season of music, where it rains all day but the sun constantly shines.

His slim mother with nervously polite smiles and voice fluttering, assuring the old man by her frailty that he was big in the world. They were squareheads one and all, marking moron time in a gray dream. Man, was he glad to break out.\n \n The old man said, \"He'll be okay. Let him alone.\"\n \n \"But he won't eat. Just lies there all the time.\"\n \n \"Hell,\" the old man said. \"Sixteen's a bad time. School over, waiting for the draft and all. He's in between. It's rough.\"\n \n Mother clasped her forearms and shook her head once slowly.\n \n \"We got to let him go, Eva. It's a dangerous time. You got to remember about all these dangerous repressed impulses piling up with nowhere to go, like they say. You read the books.\"\n \n \"But he's unhappy.\"\n \n \"Are we specialists? That's the Youth Board's headache, ain't it? What do we know about adolescent trauma and like that? Now get dressed or we'll be late.\"\n \n Wayne watched the ritual, grinning. He listened to their purposeless noises, their blabbing and yakking as if they had something to say. Blab-blab about the same old bones, and end up chewing them in the same old ways. Then they begin all over again. A freak sideshow all the way to nowhere. Squareheads going around either unconscious or with eyes looking dead from the millennium in the office waiting to retire into limbo.\n \n How come he'd been stuck with parental images like that? One thing—when he was jockeying a rocket to Mars or maybe firing the pants off Asiatic reds in some steamy gone jungle paradise, he'd forget his punkie origins in teeveeland.\n \n But the old man was right on for once about the dangerous repressed impulses. Wayne had heard about it often enough. Anyway there was no doubt about it when every move he made was a restrained explosion. So he'd waited in his room, and it wasn't easy sweating it out alone waiting for the breakout call from HQ.\n \n \"Well, dear, if you say so,\" Mother said, with the old resigned sigh that must make the old man feel like Superman with a beerbelly.\n \n They heard Wayne slouching loosely down the stairs and looked up.\n \n \"Relax,\" Wayne said. \"You're not going anywhere tonight.\"\n \n \"What, son?\" his old man said uneasily. \"Sure we are. We're going to the movies.\"\n \n He could feel them watching him, waiting; and yet still he didn't answer. Somewhere out in suburban grayness a dog barked, then was silent.\n \n \"Okay, go,\" Wayne said. \"If you wanta walk. I'm taking the family boltbucket.\"\n \n \"But we promised the Clemons, dear,\" his mother said.\n \n \"Hell,\" Wayne said, grinning straight into the old man. \"I just got my draft call.\"\n \n He saw the old man's Adam's apple move. \"Oh, my dear boy,\" Mother cried out.\n \n \"So gimme the keys,\" Wayne said. The old man handed the keys over. His understanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.\n \n \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he laughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed the Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp onto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling neon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed the glaring wonders of escape.\n \n \n\n \n He burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strode under a sign reading Public Youth Center No. 947 and walked casually to the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and a pansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.\n \n \"Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?\"\n \n Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\"\n \n \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a pass, killer?\"\n \n \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\"\n \n \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote on a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and check out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to Captain Jack, room 307.\"\n \n \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.\n \n A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne. Finally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kid breaking out tonight?\"\n \n \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a cigarette. \"I've decided.\"\n \n The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.\n\"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city and you're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes are clever hellcats in a dark alley.\"\n \n \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still a counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.\"\n \n The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head ventilated, bud, and good.\"\n \n Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the shelves and racks of weapons. \"I'll remember that crack when I get my commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal's face. \"Bring me a Smith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in a Skelly switchblade for kicks—the six-inch disguised job with the double springs.\"\n \n The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade disguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger, while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the cylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped the knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its gleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted incandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and scary.\n \n He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left armpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the way the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket back on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the elevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n \n Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with stuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain Jack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had a head shaped like a grinning bear.\n \n Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to shrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea among bowling balls.\n \n Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy head. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\n \n \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something in a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you? Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos. His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear the way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll show you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until he screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him, ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But that wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy, what was he doing holding down a desk?\n \n \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly collection.\"\n \n The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch from Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped a knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n \n Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his passcard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make out.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \n \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West Side. Know where that is, punk?\"\n \n \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\"\n \n \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow slacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a hefty psycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people. They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and they're your key to the stars.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\n \n \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack.\n \n \n\n \n A copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright respectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\n \n Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's quivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The Olds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away.\n \n The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from Slumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind. He turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale, secretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted potholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells. Wayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath through the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with the shadows of mysterious promise.\n \n He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously into it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as he spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling.\n \n  FOUR ACES CLUB\n \n \n He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging the sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass filtering through windows painted black.\n \n He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of a bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked shirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub balanced on one end.\n \n The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had a dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a grotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and doom.\n \n \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\"\n \n Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled.\n \n The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons.\n \n \"Help me, kid.\"\n \n He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast of headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed past Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires squealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and crouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n \n \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand came up swinging a baseball bat.\n \n A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n \n The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The teener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air as the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n \n Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder at finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew and no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything. Living seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless, until something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He held his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in spirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting license and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n \n The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener laughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell clogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth still open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled up with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n \n The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down with his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the Cad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling glass.\n \n \"Go, man!\"\n \n The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it bounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like bright wind-blown sparks.\n \n Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in scummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made his heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n \n He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and pursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires.\n \n \n\n \n He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and stood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and yellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\n \n He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift. The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red slash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for running, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near her, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\n \n She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude of being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a weirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\n \n Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty T-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse heavy.\n \n \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\n \n \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\n \n \"Sure, teener.\"\n \n Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and fed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She sat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\n \n Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons imbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one side. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious cat's.\n \n Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at his lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated on staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright but dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little mouse.\n \n The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in the pay of the state.\n \n \"What else, teener?\"\n \n \"One thing. Fade.\"\n \n \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\n \n Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his veins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\n \n He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped fast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the air. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the white eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her throat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\n \n \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\n \n He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table crashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast filled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door holding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was out the door.\n \n Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the cold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted down the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\n \n He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and then, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the life-or-death animation of a wild deer.\n \n Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots. Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling, sliding down a brick shute.\n \n He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her scream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood.\n \n \n\n \n She quivered above him on the stoop, panting, her eyes afire with terror.\n \n \"You, baby,\" Wayne gasped. \"I gotcha.\"\n \n She backed into darkness, up there against the sagging tenement wall, her arms out and poised like crippled wings. Wayne crept up. She gave a squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked. He clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated in the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling plaster, a whimpering whine.\n \n \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\"\n \n She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her, feeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a sagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse's shadow floated ahead.\n \n He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing ripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He heard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from cracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the third-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the jagged skylight.\n \n Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening to his creeping, implacable footfalls.\n \n Then he yelled and slammed open the door.\n \n Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In the corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like a nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior, shredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the moon-streaming skylight.\n \n She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He snickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent's tongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten cloth.\n \n \n\n \n \"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\"\n \n \"What's that, baby?\"\n \n \"I'm tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won't know the difference.\"\n \n \"I'm gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said.\n \n \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don't want—\" She began to cry. She cried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth open.\n \n \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn't sound like him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up.\n \n \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\"\n \n She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up at him.\n \n He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and shuffled away from her.\n \n He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and clutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees.\n \n \"Don't run. Please. Kill me! It'll be someone else if you don't. Oh, God, I'm so tired waiting and running!\"\n \n \"I can't,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat.\n \n \"Please.\"\n \n \"I can't, I can't!\"\n \n He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs.\n \n \n\n \n Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center, studied Wayne with abstract interest.\n \n \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton?

Two men in white coats entered.\n \n \"You should have got it out of your system, Seton, but now it's still in there. I can't turn you out and have it erupt later—and maybe shed clean innocent blood, can I?\"\n \n \"No, sir,\" Wayne mumbled. He didn't look up. \"I'm sorry I punked out.\"\n \n \"Give him the treatment,\" the doctor said wearily. \"And send him back to his mother.\"\n \n Wayne nodded and they led him away.

Wayne takes the car that his parents were going to take for their night out, and heads toward the neon lights on the freeway. When he arrives at the Public Youth Center to check in for his draft call, he acts arrogantly to the sergeant at the reception desk.

The Captain gives Wayne permission to go without curfew or law for six hours, and assigns him a task: a “beast” of a woman on the west side of town, at Four Aces Club, along with the man she is with. Wayne uses his signed pass to get past copy on his way there, driving through darker and darker streets, and  eventually makes it to the club. He ran into a drunk man who tried to ask Wayne for help, but some other teenagers pulled up a car, beat the man to death with a baseball bat, and split.

Instead of thanking them for allowing him to use the car, he repays them for their generosity by laughing at them and slamming the door in his mother’s face. Wayne is fully aware that his mother is terrified of his draft call, and he does not allow her to hug him or give him words of encouragement or advice before he leaves the house. \n\nWhen he arrives at the Youth Center, he treats the man at the front desk poorly, and then proceeds to make fun of the corporal who tries to give him advice. Wayne has a bad attitude, and it affects his interactions with everyone. \n\nThe only person that Wayne does not feel like he can treat badly is Captain Jack. Captain Jack is in a serious position of authority, and that makes Wayne nervous. He answers his questions politely. \n\nIt is truly shocking when Wayne is unable to kill the mousy woman that he was assigned to purge. He has her cornered in an abandoned and run-down building, but he can’t go through with the violence, no matter how much he wants to. In the meeting that takes place afterwards, he tells the doctor that he felt bad for the woman. Therefore, Wayne does have a conscience, even if he likes to pretend that he does not. \n"}]}, {"question_text": "How does this society seek to deal with violence?", "question_number": 5, "responses": [{"worker_id": "5", "uid": "220b7d4245314ae1bc5be811e3aeff6a", "response_text": "The expository dialogue by Doctor Burns at the end of the story provides some insight into how this society views the tendency toward violence in its citizens and retributive criminal justice. The prevailing understanding is that adolescents (presumably adolescent men) are subjected to aggressive and violent impulses. The society seeks to provide these teens a preferred outlet for these impulses in the form of a violent act in service of the state. Typical this seems to be the execution of an undesirable member of society who is viewed as beyond redemption. This permitted brutality is thought to get it out of a teen’s system and prepare him for a life as a contributing member in the state’s military apparatus. The result of this situation is a dramatically violent society where untrained youths are recruited to act as vicious vigilantes who terrorize anyone labelled as undesirable.

Although Seton enjoyed the thrill of the chase, his empathy and sympathy got the better of him. \nAfter examining him, Dr. Burns reveals the reason why Seton was sent on this mission in the first place. In this abstract reality, those who have committed heinous crimes (in this case, paternal murder and multiple homicides) are labeled as unwanted and unable to change. Instead of sending them to prison for their crimes where they may spend the rest of their lives or receive the death penalty, they send young adults out to hunt them down. \nAt 16 years old, school ends for the teenagers in this society. Once school is over, all the young adults must wait for their draft to come in. \nThey believe that each person is born with a dangerous impulse to kill. If it can be expelled at a young age and used on a person who deserves it, then there’s no risk of a violent crime later on. \nThe justice system is executed by everyday people, instead of a team of soldiers or the government. \nAs well, if the 16-year-olds complete their mission, they will be shot off to space and continue their work in the galaxy.\n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "a8e62c037525496a80f4fcca4611c6c0", "response_text": "In this society, instead of imposing penalties like death row, the government uses teenagers to end the lives of the people the society has deemed the biggest criminals. Part of this is an attempt to acknowledge the violent impulses that they expect teenagers to have, so this program is meant to give teenagers an outlet to expend this energy in hopes of getting rid of it entirely. Violent tendencies are clearly expected of everyone, as part of a more primitive instinct of sorts. The two people that Wayne was given as targets both killed people outside of this designated time, and so society decided they had to die. There is this tension between government sanctioned murder and other murder. This opportunity for teenagers to address their aggression also serves as a sort of test, and their ability to successfully eliminate their targets determines their future in some way. Formally, this means that the teenagers are given their own choice of weapons, and a six-hour pass to do whatever they want, including breaking curfew and any other laws.

When Wayne is stopped by a cop at the beginning of his mission, all he has to do is show the police officer the card he has, and he’s free to continue on into the darkness. This means that his mission is sanctioned by the state. \n\nAfter Wayne fails to commit the beatings and murders that he’s been assigned, he must receive some sort of treatment from a doctor. The thinking is that all people are born with impulses to commit violence, and those that cannot bring themselves to do it in a state sanctioned way are now in danger of hurting people that do not deserve it.

It\n   \n  was to laugh! For Click and Irish were\n   \n  marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only\n   \n  weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSuddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get\nscared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening\nto it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a\ndamned sweet picture of everything that was happening.\n \n  The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,\nwrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the\ndark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this\nmeteor coming like blazing fury.\n \n  Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's\nskin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the\nrear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.\n \n  There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was\npicked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't\nlong in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to\nhis camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had\nbeen of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of\nthe controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.\n \n  It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids\nrushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a\ntom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.\n \n  Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the\nnearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you\nended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of\nmetal death. What a fade-out!\n \n  \"Irish!\" he heard himself say. \"Is this IT?\"\n \n  \"Is this\nwhat\n?\" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.\n \n  \"Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?\"\n \n  Marnagan fumed. \"I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm\nready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!\"\n \n  They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of\ngravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.\n \n  The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over\nand stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled\naround—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,\nair and energy flung out.\n \n  Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking\nquick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach\nfilm, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like\nthis\none! His\nbrain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his\ncamera.\nSilence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.\nHathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked\nto his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold\nthat pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the\nwreckage into that silence.\n \n  He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his\nfingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,\nthinking \"Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—\"\n \n  A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven\nfeet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.\n \n  \"Hold it!\" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera\nwhirred. \"Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed\nfrom asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!\"\n \n  \"From the toe of me boot!\" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders\nflexed inside his vac-suit. \"I might've died in there, and you nursin'\nthat film-contraption!\"\n \n  Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. \"I never thought of that.\nMarnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always\nhave. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to.\" Hathaway\nstared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he\ncouldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,\npale. \"Where are we?\"\n \n  \"A million miles from nobody.\"\n \n  They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that\nstretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.\nOverhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look\nsick.\n \n  \"If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking\nhands the other side of this rock in two hours.\" Marnagan shook his mop\nof dusty red hair. \"And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd\ncapture that Gunther lad!\"\n \n  His voice stopped and the silence spoke.\n \n  Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. \"I checked\nmy oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left.\"\n \n  The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric\nrocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply\nmashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or\nwas\nsuffocation a better death...?\nSixty minutes.\nThey stood and looked at one another.\n \n  \"Damn that meteor!\" said Marnagan, hotly.\n \n  Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:\n\"Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked\nit right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.\nSpace-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've\ngot it here, on film.\"\n \n  Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. \"It's not proof we need\nnow, Click. Oxygen. And then\nfood\n. And then some way back to Earth.\"\n \n  Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: \"This is Gunther's work. He's\nhere somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.\nOh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back\nto Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate\nwhose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins\nthrough to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by\nyours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice.\"\nThey started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a\nbony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't\nmuch to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.\n \n  Marnagan said, \"We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat\nwith except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got\nfifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll\nbe Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all\nyou like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any\nwords, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about\nit. As for me—\" he twisted his glossy red face. \"Keeping alive is me\nhobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.\"\n \n  Click nodded. \"Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.\nIt's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and\nthe crash this way.\"\n \n  Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far\ndown, and the green eyes blazed.\n \n  They stopped, together.\n \n  \"Oops!\" Click said.\n \n  \"Hey!\" Marnagan blinked. \"Did you feel\nthat\n?\"\n \n  Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and\nlimbless, suddenly. \"Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!\"\n \n  They ran back. \"Let's try it again.\"\n \n  They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.\n\"Gravity should not act this way, Click.\"\n \n  \"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No\nwonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!\nGunther'd do anything to—did I say\nanything\n?\"\n \n  Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand\ncame up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable\nhorrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with\nnumerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some\ntubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along\nin the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.\n \n  Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke\ncold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed\nafter him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in\nClick's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt\nthe creatures at all.\n \n  \"Irish!\" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline\ntoward the mouth a small cave. \"This way, fella!\"\n \n  Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. \"They're\ntoo big; they can't get us in here!\" Click's voice gasped it out,\nas Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.\nInstinctively, Hathaway added, \"Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a\nscene!\"\n \n  \"Damn your damn camera!\" yelled Marnagan. \"They might come in!\"\n \n  \"Use your gun.\"\n \n  \"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,\neh, Click?\"\n \n  \"Yeah. Sure.\nYou\nenjoyed it, every moment of it.\"\n \n  \"I did that.\" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. \"Now, what\nwill we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?\"\n \n  \"Let me think—\"\n \n  \"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.\"\nThey sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt\nfunny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters\nand Gunther and—\n \n  \"Which one will you be having?\" asked Irish, casually. \"A red one or a\nblue one?\"\n \n  Hathaway laughed nervously. \"A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,\nnow you've got\nme\ndoing it. Joking in the face of death.\"\n \n  \"Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.\"\n \n  That didn't please the photographer. \"I'm an Anglo-Swede,\" he pointed\nout.\n \n  Marnagan shifted uneasily. \"Here, now. You're doing nothing but\nsitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take\nme a profile shot of the beasties and myself.\"\n \n  Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. \"What in hell's the use? All\nthis swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.\"\n \n  \"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while\nwaitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our\nrescue!\"\n \n  Hathaway snorted. \"U.S. Cavalry.\"\n \n  Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he\nsaid. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,\nmy capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace\nnegotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\"\n \n  Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver\nfor nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running\naround in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but\nhis mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of\nMarnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.\n \n  Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\nfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without\nmuch effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death\nwall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying\nanything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they\nhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n \n  When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\nup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n \n  \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\nback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\nwhat's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\nwar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\nis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which\ndispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\nSuper-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\nIt's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\nunseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\"\n \n  Marnagan rumbled. \"Where is the dirty son, then!\"\n \n  \"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them.\" Hathaway nodded at\nthe beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from\nwounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals\ntend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle\nhis attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the\nPatrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,\nthen.\"\n \n  \"I don't see no Base around.\"\nClick shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\na spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped\nit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it\ndeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing\nfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,\nleaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the\nimpressions. Quick stuff.\n \n  Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,\nClick handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\"\n \n  Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah,\nClick. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\"\n \n  \"Huh?\"\n \n  \"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid\nmonsters complete.\"\n \n  \"What!\"\n \n  Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:\nPictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally\nwith\nnothing\n; Marnagan shooting his gun at\nnothing\n; Marnagan\npretending to be happy in front of\nnothing\n.\n \n  Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!\n \n  The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair\nlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.\nMaybe—\n \n  Hathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this\nmess! Here—\"\n \n  He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,\nthe beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the\nmonsters weren't there, they weren't there.\n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave—\"\n \n  \"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click.\n \n  Marnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or\ninfra-red or something that won't come out on film?\"\n \n  \"Nuts! Any color\nwe\nsee, the camera sees. We've been fooled.\"\n \n  \"Hey, where\nyou\ngoing?\" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man\ntried pushing past him.\n \n  \"Get out of the way,\" said Hathaway.\n \n  Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. \"If anyone is going anywhere,\nit'll be me does the going.\"\n \n  \"I can't let you do that, Irish.\"\n \n  \"Why not?\"\n \n  \"You'd be going on my say-so.\"\n \n  \"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?\"\n \n  \"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—\"\n \n  \"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand\naside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their\nbones.\" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist\nexcept under an inch of porous metal plate. \"Your express purpose on\nthis voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later\nfor teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand\neducation. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me\nprofile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The\nLion's Den.\"\n \n  \"Irish, I—\"\n \n  \"Shut up and load up.\"\n \n  Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.\n \n  \"Ready, Click?\"\n \n  \"I—I guess so,\" said Hathaway. \"And remember, think it hard, Irish.\nThink it hard. There aren't any animals—\"\n \n  \"Keep me in focus, lad.\"\n \n  \"All the way, Irish.\"\n \n  \"What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!\"\n \n  Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,\ntwo, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were\nwaiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.\n \n  Right out into the middle of them....\nThat was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the\nmonsters!\n \n  Only now it was only Marnagan.\n \n  No more monsters.\n \n  Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. \"Hey, Click, look\nat me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and\nran away!\"\n \n  \"Ran, hell!\" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and\nanimated. \"They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative\nfigments!\"\n \n  \"And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you\ncoward!\"\n \n  \"Smile when you say that, Irish.\"\n \n  \"Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in\nyour sweet grey eyes?\"\n \n  \"Damn,\" swore the photographer, embarrassedly. \"Why don't they put\nwindow-wipers in these helmets?\"\n \n  \"I'll take it up with the Board, lad.\"\n \n  \"Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one\nhunk, I couldn't help—Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part\nof his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back\ninto their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing\nsuspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals\nkill them.\"\n \n  \"Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.\"\n \n  \"Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could\nhave frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If\nthat isn't being dangerous—\"\n \n  The Irishman whistled.\n \n  \"But, we've got to\nmove\n, Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.\nIn that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,\nGunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters.\" Click\nattached his camera to his mid-belt. \"Gunther probably thinks we're\ndead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never\nhad a chance to disbelieve them.\"\n \n  \"If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click—\"\n \n  \"Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident—\" Click\nstopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and\nfelt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady\nhimself, and swayed. \"I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.\nThis excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.\"\n \n  Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. \"Hold tight, Click. The\nguy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.\"\n \n  \"Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals\ncame from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come\nback!\"\n \n  \"Come back? How?\"\n \n  \"They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we\nbelieve in them again, they'll return.\"\n \n  Marnagan didn't like it. \"Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if\nwe believe in 'em?\"\n \n  Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. \"Not if we believe\nin them to a\ncertain point\n. Psychologically they can both be seen and\nfelt. We only want to\nsee\nthem coming at us again.\"\n \n  \"\nDo\nwe, now?\"\n \n  \"With twenty minutes left, maybe less—\"\n \n  \"All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?\"\n \n  Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. \"Just think—I will see\nthe monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.\nThink it over and over.\"\n \n  Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. \"And—what if I forget to remember\nall that? What if I get excited...?\"\n \n  Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at\nIrish.\n \n  Marnagan cursed. \"All right, lad. Let's have at it!\"\n \n  The monsters returned.\nA soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming\nin malevolent anticipation about the two men.\n \n  \"This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a\nsending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!\"\n \n  Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted\nfaces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.\nMarnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and\nraised his gun and made quick moves with it. \"Click! This one here!\nIt's real!\" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense\nframe slammed against rock, noiselessly.\n \n  Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the\nhelmet glass with his hands, shouting:\n \n  \"Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real—don't let it force into\nyour mind! It's not real, I tell you!\"\n \n  \"Click—\" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.\n\"Click—\" He was fighting hard. \"I—I—sure now. Sure—\" He smiled.\n\"It—it's only a shanty fake!\"\n \n  \"Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.\"\n \n  Marnagan's thick lips opened. \"It's only a fake,\" he said. And then,\nirritated, \"Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!\"\n \n  Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and\nlittle bubbles danced in his eyes. \"Irish,\nyou\nforget the monsters.\nLet me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might\nforget.\"\n \n  Marnagan showed his teeth. \"Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And\nbesides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.\"\n \n  The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.\nEvidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.\n \n  \"We'll be taking our chances on guard,\" hissed Irish. \"I'll go ahead,\ndraw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,\nyou\nshow up with\nyour\ngun....\"\n \n  \"I haven't got one.\"\n \n  \"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They\nprobably got scanners out. Let them see me—\"\n \n  And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about\nfive hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved\nup, and there was a door opening in the rock.\n \n  His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. \"A\ndoor, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!\"\n \n  Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the\nthud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.\n \n  Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.\n \n  \"All right, put 'em up!\" a new harsh voice cried over a different\nradio. One of Gunther's guards.\n \n  Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.\n \n  The strange harsh voice said, \"That's better. Don't try and pick that\ngun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.\nHow'd you get past the animals?\"\n \n  Click started running. He switched off his\nsending\naudio, kept his\nreceiving\non. Marnagan, weaponless.\nOne\nguard. Click gasped. Things\nwere getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running\nand listening to Marnagan's lying voice:\n \n  \"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles\nand stacked them up to dry, ya louse!\" Marnagan said. \"But, damn you,\nthey killed my partner before he had a chance!\"\n \n  The guard laughed.\nThe air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head\nswimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He\nlet himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't\nhave a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!\n \n  A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that\nyellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,\nair hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a\nproton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard\nhad his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: \"I think I'll let\nyou stand right there and die,\" he said quietly. \"That what Gunther\nwanted, anway. A nice sordid death.\"\n \n  Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.\n \n  \"Don't move!\" he snapped. \"I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One\ntwitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind\nyou! Freeze!\"\n \n  The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped\nhis gun to the floor.\n \n  \"Get his gun, Irish.\"\n \n  Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.\n \n  Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. \"Thanks for\nposing,\" he said. \"That shot will go down in film history for candid\nacting.\"\n \n  \"What!\"\n \n  \"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door\nleading into the Base?\"\n \n  The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.\n \n  Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.\n\"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double\ntime! Double!\"\n \n  Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on\ntheir backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,\nhid him in a huge trash receptacle. \"Where he belongs,\" observed Irish\ntersely.\n \n  They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing\nmore than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.\nPerfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was\nshort-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to\nrocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for\ncargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the\nswarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't\nwanted. They were scared off.\n \n  The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of\nintricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film\nwith images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them\ninto thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.\n \n  \"So here we are, still not much better off than we were,\" growled\nIrish. \"We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn\nup any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the\nmonsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?\"\n \n  \"What good would that do?\" Hathaway gnawed his lip. \"They wouldn't fool\nthe engineers who created them, you nut.\"\n \n  Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. \"Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come\nriding over the hill—\"\n\"Irish!\" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. \"Irish. The U.S.\nCavalry it is!\" His eyes darted over the machines. \"Here. Help me.\nWe'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.\"\n \n  Marnagan winced. \"You breathing oxygen or whiskey?\"\n \n  \"There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture\nof Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face\nwhen you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an\nactor are you?\"\n \n  \"That's a silly question.\"\n \n  \"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of\nyou, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart\nand fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down\nand twitch on the ground. Is that clear?\"\n \n  \"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....\"\n \n  An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a\nsort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,\nlined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a\nwide, green-lawned Plaza.\n \n  Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked\nacross the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that\nwas pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.\n \n  He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.\n \n  He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and\npushed him into a room where Gunther sat.\n \n  Hathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The\npirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,\nquestioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of\nmetal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he\ncould speak, Hathaway said:\n \n  \"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and\nwe're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men\nagainst your eighty-five.\"\n \n  Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands\ntwitched in his lap. \"You are bluffing,\" he said, finally, with a firm\ndirectness. \"A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the\nlast. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being\npursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\"\n \n  \"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.\"\n \n  \"Impossible!\"\n \n  \"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.\"\n \n  A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging\non carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and\nstarted yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side\nof his office. He stared, hard.\n \n  The Patrol was coming!\n \n  Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.\nFive hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis\nguns with them in their tight hands.\n \n  Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.\n\"Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\"\n \n  Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway\nhad to credit them on that. They took it, standing.\n \n  Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.\nHis camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him\nfrom filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was\nthrowing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his\nfragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.\n \n  Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three\nof the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and\ntwitch. God, what photography!\n \n  Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He\nfired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.\nThen Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos\ntaking place immediately outside his window.\n \n  The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And\nout of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\"\nOne of the Patrolmen stopped firing, and ran toward Click and the\nBuilding. He got inside. \"Did you see them run, Click boy? What an\nidea. How did we do?\"\n \n  \"Fine, Irish. Fine!\"\n \n  \"So here's Gunther, the spalpeen! Gunther, the little dried up pirate,\neh?\" Marnagan whacked Hathaway on the back. \"I'll have to hand it to\nyou, this is the best plan o' battle ever laid out. And proud I was to\nfight with such splendid men as these—\" He gestured toward the Plaza.\n \n  Click laughed with him. \"You should be proud. Five hundred Patrolmen\nwith hair like red banners flying, with thick Irish brogues and broad\nshoulders and freckles and blue eyes and a body as tall as your\nstories!\"\n \n  Marnagan roared. \"I always said, I said—if ever there could be an\narmy of Marnagans, we could lick the whole damn uneeverse! Did you\nphotograph it, Click?\"\n \n  \"I did.\" Hathaway tapped his camera happily.\n \n  \"Ah, then, won't that be a scoop for you, boy? Money from the Patrol so\nthey can use the film as instruction in Classes and money from Cosmic\nFilms for the news-reel headlines! And what a scene, and what acting!\nFive hundred duplicates of Steve Marnagan, broadcast telepathically\ninto the minds of the pirates, walking across a Plaza, capturing the\nwhole she-bang! How did you like my death-scenes?\"\n \n  \"You're a ham. And anyway—five hundred duplicates, nothing!\" said\nClick. He ripped the film-spool from the camera, spread it in the air\nto develop, inserted it in the micro-viewer. \"Have a look—\"\n \n  Marnagan looked. \"Ah, now. Ah, now,\" he said over and over. \"There's\nthe Plaza, and there's Gunther's men fighting and then they're turning\nand running. And what are they running from? One man! Me. Irish\nMarnagan! Walking all by myself across the lawn, paralyzing them. One\nagainst a hundred, and the cowards running from me!\n \n  \"Sure, Click, this is better than I thought. I forgot that the film\nwouldn't register telepathic emanations, them other Marnagans. It\nmakes it look like I'm a mighty brave man, does it not? It does. Ah,\nlook—look at me, Hathaway, I'm enjoying every minute of it, I am.\"\nHathaway swatted him on his back-side. \"Look here, you egocentric son\nof Erin, there's more work to be done. More pirates to be captured. The\nPatrol is still marching around and someone might be suspicious if they\nlooked too close and saw all that red hair.\"\n \n  \"All right, Click, we'll clean up the rest of them now. We're a\ncombination, we two, we are. I take it all back about your pictures,\nClick, if you hadn't thought of taking pictures of me and inserting\nit into those telepath machines we'd be dead ducks now. Well—here I\ngo....\"\n \n  Hathaway stopped him. \"Hold it. Until I load my camera again.\"\n \n  Irish grinned. \"Hurry it up. Here come three guards. They're unarmed.\nI think I'll handle them with me fists for a change. The gentle art of\nuppercuts. Are you ready, Hathaway?\"\n \n  \"Ready.\"\n \n  Marnagan lifted his big ham-fists.\n \n  The camera whirred.

Marnagan states that they could walk the entire diameter of the planet they are on in four hours, but Hathaway points out that he has only an hour of oxygen.  Hathaway states that he has photo evidence that the meteor that hit their ship was thrown at them, probably by Gunther, the person Marnagan is trying to capture, but Marnagan redirects their priorities to oxygen, food, and a way back to earth.\n\nAs they walk in search of help, they notice that there is human-made gravity on the planet.  Immediately after making that discovery, they encounter an enormous herd of dangerous beasts.  When Marnagan discovers his gun is ineffective as a weapon, they flee to a nearby cave for protection, as the cave is too small for the beasts to enter.\n\nMarnagan asks Hathaway to take a picture of him with the beasts.  Hathaway snaps several pictures of Marnagan posing at a safe distance.  Hathaway then says that between the “natural” meteors, gravity, and beasts, their crash will look accidental rather than like murder.  He shows Marnagan the pictures he shot, intending to use the beasts as part of his argument, but Marnagan protests that his film is “lousy” as only Marnagan, appears in the shots and not the beasts.  When Hathaway confirms this is so, he is insistent that the film cannot lie.  If the beasts do not appear in the photos, they don’t exist.\n\nWhen they emerge from the cave and the animals are gone, the men are at first elated.  Hathaway quickly realizes, though, that with their oxygen running low and limiting the time they have to find Gunther’s base and fresh oxygen, they must get the beasts to return so that they can follow the beasts to their source--Gunther’s base.\n\nThe men concentrate on the beasts and the beasts reappear; Hathaway and Marnagan locate a source point and head toward it.  Marnagan believes he is being attacked by a beast, but when Hathaway reminds him the monsters are fake, Marnagan is able to resist the telepathic message.  Marnagan enters the cave where it appears the animals are coming from and finds an air-lock door and a tunnel before he is captured by a guard.  He tells the guard his partner is dead.\n\nHathaway creeps in through the air-lock door to see Marnagan held at gunpoint.  Hathaway fools the guard into believing he is armed, takes his gun, and gets the guard to guide him and Marnagan to oxygen.

He wants to use the film footage to teach Junior Patrolmen how to get out of difficult situations. While Hathaway is filming, a meteor strikes their spaceship, knocking it down to an asteroid. The ship splits open, so there is no way for them to leave the asteroid. They both have 60 minutes of oxygen remaining. At first, they think the meteor was an accident, but then Hathaway remembers that it was red-hot and glowing before it struck them, and he knows that meteors in space are never glowing hot. Hathaway is convinced that Gunther lobbed the meteor at them to make them crash. As they begin walking on the surface of the meteor, they notice a change in the gravity in one place and realize that they have stumbled upon Gunther’s hideout. Then a horde of monsters comes charging at them, making Hathaway and Marnagan run for their lives and hide in a small cave. Marnagan fires his gun at the beasts, but it does not affect them.\n\nMarnagan has Hathaway film him facing the beasts. Hathaway has invented a film that develops itself when exposed to light. He pulls the film out of his camera for them to view, and both are surprised to find that the monsters are not on it. Hathaway thinks that the monsters are not real since they do not show up on the film. He believes they have just been tricked into thinking they are real. Marnagan agrees and decides to walk out among the monsters. When he does, the monsters disappear. Hathaway says that the monsters are still dangerous because as long as people think they are real, they might be frightened to death or commit suicide to avoid being caught by them. He also concludes that if they believe the monsters are real, they will return. \n\nBoth men say they believe in the monsters to draw them out again so that they can see where they come from.

Click realizes they have an hour left in their oxygen supplies, so they set about to find food, air, and a way to return to Earth. Click suspects the crash was engineered by Gunther himself. As they walk along the meteor, they begin to realize gravity behaves strangely there, and Click wonders if that, too, has been engineered by Gunther. Before he can think on this too deeply, they encounter a horde of monsters of all shapes and sizes coming for them over a hill. Marnagan shoots at them, but they are immune to his shots. Marnagan and Click hide in a nearby cave to hatch a plan. Marnagan poses for some pictures pretending to battle the monsters. Click posits a theory that the strange gravity and meteor attack they’d encountered earlier was Gunther’s way of crashing ships on his asteroid—an effective weapon in an age with primitive space-battle weaponry and a good way to gather supplies while being short on crew. The monsters had been sent to finish the job. When they sit down to examine Click’s footage, they see that there are no monsters in any of the shots. This leads Click to develop another theory—if the monsters weren’t really there, then neither were they! Marnagan tests his theory by walking out of the cave into the middle of the monsters. Because he believes they do not exist, they vanish completely, and the two men realize Gunther’s plan to scare to death anyone who might happen upon his asteroid. At the same time, they are running out of oxygen, and Click says they must bring the monsters back in order to follow them back to Gunther’s base.

We first see this in the opening scene of the story where Hathaway is physically clinging to Marnagan in his distress during the crash sequence.  After the crash, Hathaway is more concerned with taking photos of Marnagan emerging from the crash than helping him emerge from the rubble, not because he doesn’t care about his companion, but because he sees his companion as so strong, it doesn’t occur to him to be concerned for his physical safety.  This points to one of their key differences--while Marnagan is immediately concerned for Hathaway’s safety and assumes Hathaway would reciprocate, Hathaway sees Marnagan as much stronger than himself, nearly invulnerable.\n\nWe see Hathaway and Marnagan’s collaborative relationship continue when they are faced with the beasts.  They are both afraid; Hathaway is the first to spot the secure hiding place of the cave and hails Marnagan to run there.  Marnagan then proposes that he pose “with” the beasts--standing at a safe distance with them in the background--and Hathaway agrees.  They continue to argue about what to do while Hathaway develops the film as part of his argument.  When Hathaway presents the developed film as evidence, Marnagan teases him about his invention being “lousy”, as only he (Marnagan) shows in the photos, but the monsters do not.  This joke sets up Hathaway’s realization that the beasts are telepathic projections rather than physical beings, leading the men to debate which of them will lead the hunt for oxygen.  While Hathaway knows his partner is physically stronger and he is already suffering from oxygen deprivation, he doesn’t want to risk Marnagan’s safety if his deduction proves wrong.  Marnagan, however, shows his trust in Hathaway by insisting that he (Marnagan) lead, confident that if Hathaway says the monsters aren’t there, they are indeed not.\n\nWhen Marnagan briefly succumbs to the telepathic illusion of the beasts, Hathaway is able to talk him down.  Just by listening to Hathaway’s words, Marnagan is able to convince himself again that the beasts are not real.  Marnagan then convinces the guard he encounters that Hathaway died in the ship crash, allowing Hathaway to sneak in, capture the guard, and get both the men oxygen.  They use their teamwork in a last instance to defeat the principal antagonist of the story, Gunther.  Hathaway is captured by more of Gunther’s guards and taken to him, but is already prepared.  He shows Gunther that Gunther’s men are being overwhelmed and defeated by five hundred armed Patrol men, causing Gunther to pull out a weapon and fire wildly until Hathaway knocks him unconscious.  We then are told that the “five hundred Patrol men” are telepathic illusions of Marnagan projected by the same projectors that created the images of the beasts, supplied with photos of Marnagan shot by Hathaway.

Hathaway states shortly after the crash that the meteor that hit their ship was deliberately aimed at them with force, based on it being “hot and glowing” at the time of the collision.  Hathaway hypothesizes at that time that Gunther, the man Marnagan is trying to capture on their mission, had engineered the crash.  A short time later, when walking along the surface of the planet, Hathaway notices sudden weight loss.  After he and Marnagan test it and confirm that it really happened, they conclude that their ship was not only hit by a meteor, it was dragged down to the planet by an unnatural amount of gravity, more than the planet is generating.  They then meet horrifying, dangerous monsters, but these are revealed in short order to be telepathic projections.  They are able to dispel the images of the monsters by their own belief that the monsters are not really there, then summon them back by imagining that they are there, but that the monsters cannot harm them.  In this way, the monsters lead them to Gunther, who is captured when Marnagan and Hathaway use the telepathic projectors that generated the “monster” images to generate hundreds of images of Marnagan, making it appear that there is an army ready to take over Gunther’s base and capture or kill all his men.  All of this flows from the initial crash engineered by Gunther with the propelled meteor and the area of super-gravity that pulled the ship down to the planet.  Gunther hoped to make the ship disappear and Marnagan and Hathaway along with it.  Instead, they crashed on the single planet where they could find him and had to take on an immediate quest to search for him in order to survive, as they had limited oxygen and needed to find the only other humans on the planet in order to replenish their supply."}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "153a03df0ed44556a2718fcde88a092d", "response_text": "The crash in the opening scene sets up the conflict with Gunther in the climax of the story.

Hathaway speculates that Gunther crashes or pulls ships onto his asteroid. Gunther is short on men, and space weapons are inaccurate, so he uses super-gravity to crash the ships. The people die from a lack of air or food or their injuries from the crash.

Rather than telepathy being used by one character to discern the thoughts of another character, as is often the case, we instead have machines creating telepathic projections.  It is fitting, then, that since machines are creating the telepathic projections, a machine can also defeat them.  The camera does not \"see\" through interpreting images or trying to understand them.  It only records light and shadow.  For this reason, it remains unaffected by telepathy--it can only record what is there, not what is projected into the mind.\n\nHathaway and Marnagan become trapped in a small cave by what they believe are dangerous wild beasts.  Marnagan asks Hathaway to take his pictures as Marnagan poses against the backdrop of the beasts.  When Marnagan looks at the photos and complains that the beasts do not appear, Hathaway realizes that the beasts are not physically real, but only telepathic projections in the men's minds.  He and Marnagan are then able to dismiss the beasts and bring them back at will in order to let the projections lead them to their source.\n\nTelepathy plays a significant role again when Hathaway and Marnagan formulate a plan to capture Gunther, the person Marnagan is on a mission to capture and the man that caused their crash.  While the two of them could easily overpower Gunther if he were alone, there are at least fifty guards with him at his base.  Hathaway realizes they can photograph Marnagan in poses as though he's taking over the base and use those images in the telepathic projector against the guards and Gunther.  The telepathic projector turns one Marnagan into five hundred, allowing the two men to easily capture the base and Gunther while the guards flee.  The guards are likely aware of the telepathic projectors, but do not suspect that Hathaway and Marnagan have managed to turn the projectors to their own ends.

Flowers,\n   \n  had stumbled onto a murderous plot more\n   \n  hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.\n   \n  And the danger from the villain of the piece\n   \n  didn't worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nI was killing an hour in the billiard room of the\nSpacemen's Club\nin Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\nshoulder.\n \n  \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\nthee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\n \n  A woman here...! The\nSpacemen's\nwas a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n \n  Grannie Annie!\n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\nSpacemen's\n? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n \n  \"What happened to\nGuns for Ganymede\n?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\nGrannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n \n  \"It wasn't\nGuns\n, it was\nPistols\n; and it wasn't\nGanymede\n, it was\nPluto\n.\"\n \n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n \n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n \n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n \n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\nSatellite\nTheater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\nSatellite\n.\n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\nzilcon\nwood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\nONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\nA tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\nadvanced to the footlights.\n \n  \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\nmyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\n \n  There was a roar of applause from the\nSatellite\naudience. When it had\nsubsided, the man continued:\n \n  \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\nto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\nnine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\nsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\nThese questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\nquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\nplanetoles\n.\n \n  \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\nher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\nscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\n \n  From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\non the dais.\n \n  The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\ndials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\ncoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\nvoice echoed through the theater:\n \n  \"\nWho was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?\n\"\n \n  Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\nhand. She said quietly:\n \n  \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\ntracto-car.\"\n \n  And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\nthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\ncafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\nbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\nor when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\nthe winner.\n \n  It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\nbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.\n \n  The audience in the\nSatellite\nseemed to have lost much of its\noriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\nsignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\n \n  Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\ngeneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\nwere turned in a smile of satisfaction.\n \n  When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\ncrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\noccurred.\n \n  A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\ndragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\nunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\nthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\nan earlier era.\n \n  Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\nman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\nwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\nsnipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\ninto his mouth.\n \n  Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\nrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\nshout derisive epithets.\n \n  Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\nand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\nTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\nwas all but deserted.\n \n  In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\neyes.\n \n  \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\n \n  I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men\nought to clamp down.\"\n \n  \"The I.P. men aren't strong enough.\"\n \n  She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\nline about her usually smiling lips.\n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\nFor a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n \n  \"My last book,\nDeath In The Atom\n, hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n \n  \"Who?\" I interrupted.\n \n  \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n \n  The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n \n  I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n \n  \"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\nAlpha\nrays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\nGamma\nrays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\nBeta\nor cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n \n  \"When any form of life is exposed to these\nGamma\nrays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n \n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n \n  I shrugged.\n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n \n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\nen masse\n.\"\n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n \n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\nZinnng-whack!\n\"All right!\"\n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n \n  A heat ray!\n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n \n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\nSix days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n \n  We had traveled this far by\nganet\n, the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\njagua\ncanoes.\n \n  It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n \n  \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n \n  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n \n  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n \n  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n \n  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n \n  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n \n  \"Stand still!\"\n \n  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\nGrannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\nI stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n \n  \"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n \n  \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n \n  \"Then that would mean...?\"\n \n  \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\"\nThe following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\nvarpa\ncloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n \n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n \n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n \n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n \n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n \n  \"Dangerous?\"\n \n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n \n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n \n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n \n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n \n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n \n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n \n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away.\nHalf an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\nwere ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\ncamped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\nabout us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\ndespondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\nfutility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\nfrom turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\nthat all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\n \n  After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\nsteaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\nadvance on foot.\n \n  It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\nsuddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\nThere it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened\narelium\nsteel,\nhalf buried in the swamp soil.\n \n  \"What's that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\n \n  A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\nquarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\nsuspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\ninsulators.\n \n  Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\nVenusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\ncircle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\n \n  But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\nMoments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\n \n  A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\nMid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\n \n  \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\nclimb slowly.\n \n  The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\nThere was no sign of life.\n \n  \"Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\n \n  Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\nleft side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\nbare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\nclarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\nlooked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\nswing slowly to and fro.\n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\nthe lower hold are probably exposed to a\ntholpane\nplate and their\nradiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\n \n  Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\nglass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\n \n  \"You'll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\natomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\nguards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the\nGreen Flames are more accessible.\"\n \n  In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\nthe feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\nvessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\nSuspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\nplate.\n \n  But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\n \n  Grannie stamped her foot. \"It's maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\nthe crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single\nmove.\"\nOutside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently\nunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire\nand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding\ndesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this\ntime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe\nand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of\nthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe\nprogram.\n \n  \"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once,\nbut I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought\nto make him king or somethin'.\"\n \n  For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped\nto her feet.\n \n  \"Say that again!\" she cried.\n \n  The old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to\nmake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\"\n \n  \"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness\nand returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this\nis\nDoctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a\nmethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's\nhold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such\na way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.\nDon't you see?\"\n \n  I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.\n \n  \"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames\nradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The\nDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but\nthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations\nfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and\ntheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic\nscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\"\n \n  \"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\"\n \n  \"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial\ncontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,\nDoctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the\nminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'\nradiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\"\n \n  I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.\n \n  And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the\ntents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had\ndropped away to be replaced by another.\n \n  There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the\nimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And\nsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the\nold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.\n \n  An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was\nfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.\nOpposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar\npunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.\n \n  \"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our\nonly escape is to make 'em laugh!\"\n \n  He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.\nAbruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped\nand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping\njack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.\n \n  Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen\nblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild\nlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n \n  Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n \n  Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled.\nInside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes\nfilled with excitement.\n \n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop\nDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.\nRight now we're nicely bottled up.\"\n \n  As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz\nmaster on the screen. He was saying:\n \n  \"\nRemember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of\nunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow\nnight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.\n\"\n \n  With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the\nVenusians.\n \n  \"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n \n  She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled\nup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship\nwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.\n \n  Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled\nthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.\nNext she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought\nalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.\nShe fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every\ntwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and\nfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.\n \n  Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she\nselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity\nof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and\nout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.\n \n  At length she finished.\n \n  \"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll\ntell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow\nnight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme\ndictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this ship\nunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast—the laughing\nof the Varsoom!\"\n \n  \"You're going to what?\"\n \n  \"Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.\nVisualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universe\nmakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wild\npeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\"\n \n  \"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn.\n \n  \"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly.\n \n  I, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar\nPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that\nmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly\ntried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter\nsilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the\nscheduled Doctor Universe program.\n \n  Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. \"Maybe we've got\nto attract their attention first,\" he suggested. \"Miss Flowers, why\ndon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something from\none of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit\nup and take notice.\"\n \n  For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to her\nfeet quickly.\n \n  \"I'll do it,\" she said. \"I'll read them the attack scene from\nMurder\nOn A Space Liner\n.\"\nIt didn't make sense, of course. But nothing made sense in this mad\nventure. Grannie Annie opened her duffel bag and drew out a copy of\nher most popular book. With the volume under her arm, she mounted the\nladder to the top of the envelope. Ezra Karn rigged up a radite search\nlamp, and a moment later the old woman stood in the center of a circle\nof white radiance.\n \n  Karn gripped my arm. \"This is it,\" he said tensely. \"If this fails ...\"\n \n  His voice clipped off as Grannie began to read. She read slowly\nat first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and more\ndramatically.\n \n  And out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening.\n \n  \"...\nthe space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shot\nfrom the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the control\ncabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to free\nhimself. Opposite him, lashed by strong Martian vinta ropes to the\ngravascope, Louise Belmont sobbed softly, wringing her hands in mute\nappeal.\n\"\n \n  A restless rustling sounded out in the marsh, as if hundreds of bodies\nwere surging closer. Karn nodded in awe.\n \n  \"She's got 'em!\" he whispered. \"Listen. They're eatin' up every word.\"\n \n  I heard it then, and I thought I must be dreaming. From somewhere out\nin the swamp a sound rose into the thick air. A high-pitched chuckle,\nit was. The chuckle came again. Now it was followed by another and\nanother. An instant later a wave of low subdued laughter rose into the\nair.\n \n  Ezra Karn gulped. \"Gripes!\" he said. \"They're laughing already.\nThey're laughing at her book!\nAnd look, the old lady's gettin' sore.\"\n \n  Up on the roof of the envelope Grannie Annie halted her reading to\nglare savagely out into the darkness.\n \n  The laughter was a roar now. It rose louder and louder, peal after peal\nof mirthful yells and hysterical shouts. And for the first time in my\nlife, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shook\nher fist at the unseen hordes out before her.\n \n  \"Ignorant slap-happy fools!\" she screamed. \"You don't know good science\nfiction when you hear it.\"\n \n  I turned to Karn and said quietly, \"Turn on the visi set. Doctor\nUniverse should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull in\nas much of that laughter as you can.\"\nIt took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City. The Varsoom\nfollowed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen\narmy in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did\nthe last chuckle fade into the distance.\n \n  All during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently\nout before her.\n \n  But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all\nsides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR\nUNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN\nAUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.\n \n  \"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE\nJET, \"what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?\"\n \n  She looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile.\n \n  \"Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't\nappreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell\nyarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background\nmaterial?\"\n \n  I shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said.\n \n  But I knew I would.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "2743b2a32c124317af7ddaf7350b9d72", "response_text": "Grannie Annie,  a prolific science fiction novelist, goes to see Billy at a men’s club.

Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people’s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show. When they arrived, they found the ship outfitted with a self-operating broadcasting unit which was well-protected behind unbreakable glass. The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra’s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show. The group could not find a way to make them laugh, until Grannie read them her book.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\"\n \n \"On my way, sir!\"\n \n At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already throwing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one chance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The throbbing rumble changed tone.\n \n Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.\n\"Well, Mr. O'Rielly?\"\n \n \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\n \n O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn't you lock them controls before blast-off?\"\n \n \"If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,\" O'Rielly answered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have registered before blast-off—wouldn't it, sir?\"\n \n \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\n \n \"I don't know yet, sir.\"\n \n \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\n \n The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all aboard gone in a churning cloud.\n \n Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed and a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner Chief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch room. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it. By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably inquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\n \n Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt that way.\n \n She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which O'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!\n \n \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I couldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door. So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there, naturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned resetting the control.\"\n \n \n\n \n O'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her until she couldn't sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a breath against woman's supremacy in all matters. That male character trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why O'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one's person, heard himself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all that bother to get out here!\"\n \n \"You're so kind. But I'm afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in there.\"\n \n \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I'll drop a suggestion in the Old Woman's box first chance I get.\"\n \n \"You're so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\"\n \n \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\"\n \n \"You're so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence that O'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for her.\n \n Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover when he'd been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who had a jug to cheer one's parting with one's money.\n \n A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\n \n When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well, what about that control?\"\n \n \"What control?\"\n \n \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\n \n \"Oh, that little thing.\"\n \n Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'Rielly sharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again? Lemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll again probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\n \n \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly said while bowing gracefully.\n \n \"Higher than a swacked skunk's tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then snapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\n \n O'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that Burner Chief Terrence Callahan's mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody's, would be improved by knowledge of she who was in O'Rielly's shower now. Not that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary. Oh, very quite!\n \n \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn't I tell you to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman's taking a Venus bigwig on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks she'll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she'll do anyway about your fusion control!\"\n \n \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have been thinking.\"\n \n \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for myself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O'Rielly's shower door.\n \n \"Venus dames,\" O'Rielly said dreamily, \"don't boss anything, do they?\"\n \n Callahan yelped like he'd been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\n\"O'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\" Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan's eyes rolled like the devil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O'Rielly, open your big ears whilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\n \n \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or family—everything.\n \n \"Well, that's when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats with knots in their tails. Before the guys who'd brought the Venus dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on Earth again there wouldn't be enough left of Venus to find with an electron microscope.\n \n \n\n \n \"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny notions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in an atom's eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys. Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million light years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a deal.\n \n \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys stay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave Venus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught around a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything at bargain basement prices.\"\n \n \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O'Rielly said, still dreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\n \n \"Pray heaven you'll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten foot of you! Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn't make a whit difference—you'd still act sappier than thirty-seven angels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. \"Holy hollering saints!\"\n \n \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded with an airy laugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and lived to tell it, has he?\"\n \n \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing into his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\n \n \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O'Rielly snorted.\n\"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\n \n \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\n\"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough to stuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags, even through customs? Just run 'em through the big Geiger that tells whether there's any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself one of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig's pile of\n'em.\n \n \"Didn't pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when a crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation. Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his ears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving. Wasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\"\n \n With suddenly enlivened interest O'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how come you know so much?\"\n \n \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned to himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look! I was a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more, you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't high on vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we feed the Old Woman?\"\n \n \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully.\n \n \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for! Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at least!\"\n \n Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee. Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway was saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her lovely neck and his own forever.\n \n O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not opened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n \n At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old head. \"Berta!\"\n \n \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's name is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and twenty-five years ago.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and was being slapped together again. \"O'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced pirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up, you don't have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we don't flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in a zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into O'Rielly's shower.\n \n O'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite Trillium. Just like that, O'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a spiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open the doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap and coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\n \n \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\" Trillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\n \n Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this ship. O'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don't you worry about another thing!\"\n \n \"Oh, I'm not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the way Grandmamma knew it would!\"\n \n O'Rielly's shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko, bounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No, don't tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\n \n \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted to know.\n \n The watch room's door had opened. Wouldn't think the Old Woman was a day over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform probably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure. Frosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she looked at O'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\n \n Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\n \n Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\n \n She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked you a question, did I not?\"\n \n \"Believe you did, ma'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the answer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was discussing—ah—matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly here is considering it, ma'am.\"\n \n Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more ideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of before in his life. Yes, ma'am!\n \n \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman's look was fit to freeze O'Rielly's brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you down here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\n \n \"Oh, you'll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma'am!\" Callahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean, women—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing the control phenomenon, ma'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young Burnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan said with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed 'twouldn't bother me none if there wasn't one of the things left in the world! Present company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a courtly bow.\n \n \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face, then in O'Rielly's vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\" she muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there again. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for? Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this burner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join me, Your Excellency?\"\n \n \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female ever told any Venus man what to do.\n \n The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly blowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed of person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His Excellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with sweat.\n \n Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You first, Your Excellency.\"\n \n \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\n\"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\n \n No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old Woman, a prime symbol of her gender's superiority, whipped a razor edge onto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain's quarters are more satisfactory.\"\n \n \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\n \n \n\n \n Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave O'Rielly's watch room. Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from busting out laughing for joy.\n \n Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And betwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd be happy forever.\n \n A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and yanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk.\n \n \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of course.\n \n \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the sabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\n \n \"Trillium,\" O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to keep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?\"\n \n Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladly drowned himself if he could.\n \n \n\n \n \"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of outer space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and for her leaving her planet.\"\n \n \"Shut up!\" His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight out sideways. \"I'll handle this!\"\n \n \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\n \n \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President of Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\n \n \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled at that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at O'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\n \n O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan looked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness and protect it to his last breath of life.\n \n Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk. Panels on opposite walls lit up.\n \n \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\n\"Interplanetary emergency.\"\n \n Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally pleasant.\n \n \"Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\n \n \"Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious war efforts.\"\n \n Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship. Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\n \n The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a blizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\n \n Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The facts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\n \n The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features, that were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My own granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his Excellency, \"what's this nonsense?\"\n \n \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with annoyance.\n \n \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\n\"Some silly female cackling now!\"\n \n The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one's left hand on a desk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\n \n \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\n \n \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\n \n \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by those two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\n \n \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by myself, and Mr. O'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\n \n \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President's ear beards stood near straight up as he roared, \"You couldn't have stolen away by yourself! Trillium, tell the truth!\"\n \n \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged,\" His Excellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the first thing about such things!\"\n \n \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I've been married to her for a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finest rattle-brain I ever knew!\"\n \n \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five years ago.\"\n \n \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling volcano. \"The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil.... Berta? Impossible!\"\n \n Madame President's shapely finger now rested full on the button that could launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a thousand years. \"I'm afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame President stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter's actions have every mark of an invasion tactic by your government.\"\n \n \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President's finger now lay poised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow Earth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under your official command! Weren't you, Trillium dear?\"\n \n \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring our cause to the attention of Earth's President. If Earth will only stop buying from Venus, you won't have any money to squander on your wars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!\"\n \n \"Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what's wrong with my wars? People have to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobody around here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. But nobody on Venus dies from the things any more.\"\n \n \"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they haven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatal attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men home doing useful work!\"\n \n \"Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every ten months. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.\"\n \n \"More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home and be lonely!\"\n \n \"Now you just listen to me, Trillium!\" Grandpapa President was all Venus manhood laying down the law. \"That's the way things have been on Venus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can't change it!\"\n \n \"I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during these conversations,\" Madame President said crisply. \"Earth is terminating all trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.\"\n \n \"What?\" Grandpapa's beards near pulled his ears off. \"It's not legal! You can't get away with this!\"\n \n \"Take your finger off that trigger, boy!\" a heavenly voice similar to Trillium's advised from the Venus panel.\n \n Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. \"Berta! What are you doing here? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!\"\n \n \"Were.\" Features more beautifully mature than Trillium's crowded onto the panel too. \"From now on I'm doing the deciding.\"\n \n \"Nonsense! You're only my wife!\"\n \n \"And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.\"\n \n \"Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody's turning this planet into another Earth where a man can't even sneeze unless some woman says so!\"\n \n \"Take him away, girls,\" Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse was yanked from view.\n \n His bellows, however, could be heard yet. \"Unhand me, you fool creatures! Guards! Guards!\"\n \n \"Save your breath,\" Berta advised him. \"And while you're in the cooler, enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are in control everywhere now.\"\n \n \"Dimmy,\" Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, \"you have beat around the bush with me long enough. Now say it!\"\n \n \n\n \n Dimdooly—the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere Earthmen kowtowing to a mere woman—swelled up fit to blow his gaskets, then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had enough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I love only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\n \n \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it works. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we Venus women had our own men in our power.\"\n \n \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth's tranquility.\"\n \n Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden. Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest headache in history.\n \n \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame President of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\n \n \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to receive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest convenience.\"\n \n \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological moment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the communications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels broadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the top man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take over Dimmy's credentials.\"\n \n \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said graciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\n \n \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that Mr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our revolution better than they knew.\"\n \n \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs best.\"\n \n The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan. Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his old conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure before returning to your stations.\"\n \n \"Oh, well,\" O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond earshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\n \n \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of Saturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the crows for breakfast.\" Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a little grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\n \n \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O'Rielly said in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why did Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?\"\n \n \"Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled, like to himself, \"they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep, guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live. Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be one much longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves but didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing to take over Venus, I guess.\"\n \n O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium before her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leave Grandmamma?\"\n \n \"Yes, ma'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Rielly said, \"you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'n Billy-be-damned. And that's all.\"\n \n \"I'm not sure,\" O'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, 'that's all.'\"\n \n \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards? Course not.\"\n \n \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\n \n \"Ain't nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma'am.

The story begins when his supervisor, Burner Chief Callahan, alerts O’Rielly that one of the controls on his burner has slipped, so he sets about resetting the controls to prevent the ship from crashing when it starts its descent toward Earth. He searches his watch room and around the burner looking for a mouse or anyone who might have moved the control. He thinks about Captain Millicent Hatwoody, the ship’s commander nicknamed “Old Woman”, and worries she will exile him to a distant moon if she discovers the issue. During his search, he discovers a stowaway Venusian woman named Trillium on his bunk bed, and she tells him she had moved the control in order to escape the burner room where she was hiding. O’Rielly is struck by her beauty and allows her to shower in his bathroom. While she is showering, Callahan to interrogate O’Rielly and instructs him to take a shower because Captain Hatwoody is bringing a guest to tour the facilities. He reminds O’Rielly of the history of the Earth women’s supremacy over men, which began as a response to the Earth men’s infatuation with Venusian women. When they established dominance, the Earth women returned the Venusian women to their planet. Consequently, the Venusian men warned of war if any Earth men attempted to contact Venusian women. For their part, Venusian women would be killed if they tried to leave. To soften the threat, Venus agreed to let Earth purchase products at a lower cost. O’Rielly reminds Callahan that no Earth man has seen a Venusian woman in 125 years, and Callahan tells the story—an Earth man disguised himself as a Venusian in order to visit his love, a Venusian woman named Berta. When Trillium returns, she reveals that she is Berta’s granddaughter. She hides again before Captain Hatwoody arrives. The captain and her guest, a Venusian ambassador named Dimdooly, investigate the burner, and their interactions reveal conflicting attitudes towards gender superiority on Earth versus Venus. As they leave, Trillium reveals herself, and Dimdooly recognizes her as the Venusian president’s granddaughter. Captain Hatwoody then calls the presidents of both planets, who begin to blame each other and threaten war. Trillium explains that it was Berta, the president’s wife, who taught her how to stowaway, as she had done so herself 125 years prior. She reveals her purpose for stowing away was to draw attention to her revolutionary vision—to convince Earth to stop purchasing products from Venus, thus stopping their cash flow to fund wars. She explains the wars distract Venusian men, and that is why the women are attracted to Earth men. While the president balks, his wife orders him to step aside as she has been elected new President of Venus, and the Venusian women are taking over. Trillium is rewarded with Dimdooly’s ambassadorship, and Callahan and O’Rielly are sent back to work.

They took the Venus women back to Venus and warned that there would be a war if any of them came back to Earth.

The ship is returning to Earth, and burner number four has a fusion control reading that is two points low. This can cause the ship to crash on landing. The ship has futuristic features including an electronic shower that can cleanse a person and his clothes in a matter of minutes and video conference calls. On the initial flight from Earth to Venus, the Earthmen discovered the beauty of the Venus women and immediately fell in love with them. They took some Venus women back to Earth, and men there abandoned everything, even their wives and families, to try to be with the Venus women. Earth women were angry at how the men acted and took control of the planet; they also sent all the Venus women back to their home planet. Now Earth and Venus trade with each other, but Earthmen and Venus women are not allowed to be together because doing so can spark a war between the two planets. Earth has a female president, and women hold all the positions of authority over men. Venus has a male president who is very traditional and does not agree with the women of Venus that their men need to be home for more than two weeks every year and spend the rest of their time fighting in wars.

Likewise, Venusian men banned Earth men from interacting with Venusian women under threat of war. This led to an agreement where Earth and Venus could conduct trade together for cheaper prices.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beach over the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubby ship from another planet with the upper air. He looked out across the heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully because of the lesser gravitation.\n \n Thig was shorter than the average Earthman—although on Ortha he was well above the average in height—but his body was thick and powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n \n The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n \n Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet, however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\n \n The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\n \n Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished metal at the reflection of himself!\n \n The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped across the mouth and neck of the stranger....\n \n \n\n \n Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't dared touch the machine since.\n \n For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on a trailer tour of the West that very summer. Since that promise, he could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out of his subconscious. Yet he had to write at least three novelets and a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great adventure—or the trip was off.\n \n So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a salable yarn....\n \n \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the road. \"What's the trouble?\"\n \n Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.\n \n \n\n \n \"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured Earthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that must have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n \n \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he wears he might be Thig.\"\n \n \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the two inner planets.\"\n \n \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use of our limbs so.\"\n \n \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling out his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that you disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n \n \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted Terry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n \n Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion, their love-life, their everything!\n \n So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their heads.\n \n For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n \n \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.\n\"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming baubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.\"\n \n An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running inland to his home.\n \n Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n \n He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from around his heart.\n \n Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding the emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n \n Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed, trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked achingly up into his throat.\n \n \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\" and three other editors asked for shorts soon.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\n \n For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this way, he realized—more natural.\n \n \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the glittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing but a handful of these.\"\n \n He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung, unbelieving, to his arm.\n \n \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\n \n \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he hoped that the west had reformed.\n \n \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\n \n \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.\n \n \n\n \n \"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n \n \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went on as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n \n Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the chaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n \n Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world, including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would, of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people, imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the Hordes?\n \n Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty added zest to every day's life.\n \n The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered, would one new world—or a hundred—populated by the Hordes add to the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast mechanical hives.\n \n There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever, who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept—the son of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n \n Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the road toward the beach.\n \n The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the door and called after him.\n \n \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n \n He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n \n Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that lived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never be written, but he toyed with the idea.\n \n So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from the unquestioning worship of the Horde!\n \n \n\n \n \"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to Ortha at once.\n \n \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient for the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n \n \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own degree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n \n \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\n \n \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.\n\"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet. There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long forgotten.\"\n \n \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n \n Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n \n The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an empty world—this planet was not for them.\n \n \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need this planet.\"\n \n Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac of the finest members of the Horde.\n \n \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.\n\"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we must eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n \n Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it could be uttered.\n \n Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand fought against that lone arm of Thig.\n \n \n\n \n The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.\n \n Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated matter. Horror for what he had done—that he had slain one of his own Horde—made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the narrowed icy eyes of his commander.\n \n He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way. His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy yarn—they would all be dead anyhow soon.\n \n Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow....\n \n \n\n \n Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed him with those savage blows upon the head.\n \n Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his unconscious body.\n \n Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible for his sudden madness.\n \n The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the weapon. He tugged it free.\n \n In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face, the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled out into a senseless whinny.\n \n Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and chest. He was a madman!\n \n The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove. The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of the Orthan.\n \n So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that victory had given him to drive him along.\n \n He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\n \n He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and read the last few nervously scrawled lines:\n  Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended. Already I feel the insidious virus of....\n \n \n And there his writing ended abruptly.\n \n Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\n \n Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\n \n He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his.\n \n \n Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving him from the parent ship.\n \n\n \n He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first existence.\n \n He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the monotonous routine of existence that had once been his—and his heart thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days he had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\n \n He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching the ship echoed through the hull-plates.\n \n He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that crowded his mind.\n \n He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that, despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer space.\n \n He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories were hot, bitter pains.\n \n \n\n \n Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he heaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's creation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the West. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n \n The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her dreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n \n The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines of Long Island in the growing twilight.\n \n A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically. He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about them....\n \n He was Lewis Terry!

L. GOLD\nHarvey and Joe were the slickest con-men ever\n   \n  to gyp a space-lane sucker. Or so they thought!\n   \n  Angus Johnson knew differently. He charged them\n   \n  five buckos for a glass of water—and got it!\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1943.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nCharacteristically, Harvey Ellsworth tried to maintain his dignity,\nthough his parched tongue was almost hanging out. But Joe Mallon, with\nno dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of land\nthat had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontifically\ninto the battered metalloy saloon—the only one on Planetoid 42—his\ntall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing something\nincoherent. They met in the doorway, violently.\n \n  \"We're delirious!\" Joe cried. \"It's a mirage!\"\n \n  \"What is?\" asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton.\n \n  Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared,\nspeechless for once.\n \n  In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea\npurveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had\nthey seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.\n \n  Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two\nhands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the\nremaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish\nHarvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this\nimpossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit\njuice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.\n \n  \"Nonsense,\" Harvey croaked uncertainly. \"We have seen enough queer\nthings to know there are always more.\"\n \n  He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:\n\"Water—quick!\"\n \n  Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out\ntwo glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked\nfor more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartender\nhad taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey.\n \n  Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water so\nfast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender's\nimpersonal eyes studying them shrewdly.\n \n  \"Strangers, eh?\" he asked at last.\n \n  \"Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,\" Harvey answered in his usual\nlush manner. \"We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,\nLa-anago\nYergis\n, the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in\nthe ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in\nproclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history\nof therapeutics.\"\n \n  \"Yeah?\" said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser\nglasses without washing them. \"Where you heading?\"\n \n  \"Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gone\nwithout water for five ghastly days.\"\n \n  \"Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?\" Joe asked.\n \n  \"We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't land\nhere unless they're in trouble.\"\n \n  \"Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.\"\n \n  \"Mayor takes care of that,\" replied the saloon owner. \"If you gents're\nfinished at the bar, your drinks'll be forty buckos.\"\n \n  Harvey grinned puzzledly. \"We didn't take any whiskey.\"\n \n  \"Might as well. Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with every\nchaser.\"\n \n  Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. \"That—that's robbery!\" the lanky man\nmanaged to get out in a thin quaver.\n \n  The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain't many customers, you gotta\nmake more on each one. Besides—\"\n \n  \"Besides nothing!\" Joe roared, finding his voice again. \"You dirty\ncrook—robbing poor spacemen! You—\"\n\"You dirty crook!\" Joe roared. \"Robbing honest spacemen!\"\nHarvey nudged him warningly. \"Easy, my boy, easy.\" He turned to the\nbartender apologetically. \"Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands are\nsometimes overactive. You were going to say—?\"\nThe round face of the barkeeper had assumed an aggrieved expression.\n \n  \"Folks are always thinkin' the other feller's out to do 'em,\" he said,\nshaking his head. \"Lemme explain about the water here. It's bitter\nas some kinds of sin before it's purified. Have to bring it in with\nbuckets and make it sweet. That takes time and labor. Waddya think—I\nwas chargin' feller critters for water just out of devilment? I charge\nbecause I gotta.\"\n \n  \"Friend,\" said Harvey, taking out a wallet and counting off eight\nfive-bucko bills, \"here is your money. What's fair is fair, and you\nhave put a different complexion on what seemed at first to be an\nunconscionable interjection of a middleman between Nature and man's\nthirst.\"\n \n  The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar.\n \n  \"If that's an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor'll discuss filling\nyour tanks. That's me. I'm also justice of the peace, official\nrecorder, fire chief....\"\n \n  \"And chief of police, no doubt,\" said Harvey jocosely.\n \n  \"Nope. That's my son, Jed. Angus Johnson's my name. Folks here just\ncall me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will\nyou need?\"\n \n  Joe estimated quickly. \"About seventy-five liters, if we go on half\nrations,\" he answered. He waited apprehensively.\n \n  \"Let's say ten buckos a liter,\" the mayor said. \"On account of the\nquantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me\nmore to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,\nthat's all.\"\n \n  The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with\nthem. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently\nwatched the crude level-gauge, crying \"Stop!\" when it registered the\nproper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and\nwetted his lips expectantly.\n \n  Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: \"But what are we to\ndo about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be\npreposterous. We simply can't afford it.\"\n \n  Johnson's response almost floored them. \"Who said anything about\ncharging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.\nIt's just the purified stuff that comes so high.\"\n \n  After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water\npool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed\nback to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.\n \n  \"Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?\" said Harvey as he and Joe\npicked up buckets that hung on the tank. \"Johnson, as I saw instantly,\nis the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.\"\n \n  \"Just the same,\" Joe griped, \"paying for water isn't something you can\nget used to in ten minutes.\"\n \n  In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from\nthe igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,\naccording to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their\nbuckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more.\nIt was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on\na bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign\nin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping\na faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to\ninvestigate.\n \n  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound\nthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.\n \n  \"What's this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had\nto transport water in pails.\"\n \n  \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily.\n \n  \"It leads\nto\nthe saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the\npipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it\nleads\nfrom\n.\"\n \n  Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of\nscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst\ninto the open—before a clear, sparkling pool.\n \n  Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.\n \n  \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.\n \n  But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and\ntasting it.\n \n  \"Sweet!\" he snarled.\n \n  They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.\nHis mouth went wry. \"Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The\nonly thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor's\nconscience.\"\n \n  \"The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,\" said\nHarvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. \"Joseph, the good-natured artist in\nme has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we\nhave had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from this\npoint hence.\"\n \n  Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door they\nstopped and their fists unclenched.\n \n  \"Thought you gents were leaving,\" the mayor called out, seeing them\nfrozen in the doorway. \"Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.\nHim and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\"\n \n  \"You don't need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed.\n \n  Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair\nand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been\nborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have\nkept him down near the general dimensions of a man.\n \n  He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own\nhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when\nhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed\none.\n \n  \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense\natmosphere.\n \n  The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and\nunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....\n \n  \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n \n  Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were\ngently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features\ndrooping like a bloodhound's.\n \n  \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming\ndown with asteroid fever!\"\n \n  \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\nof the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\n \n  \"What do you mean,\nonce\n?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\nevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\nout of here!\"\n \n  \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\"\n \n  \"Then he'll be here for months!\"\n \n  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\nhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\nin tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\n \n  \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\nfrantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\ncups—\"\n \n  \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\nrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\n \n  \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\n \n  Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\nrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\nfew minutes, carrying a bottle.\nJoe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowly\ncrossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly,\nput the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.\nWhen Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partner\ndrink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back and\nwaited for the inevitable result.\n \n  Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for several\nmoments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomed\nto perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his features\nstraightened out.\n \n  \"Are—are you all right?\" asked the mayor anxiously.\n \n  \"Much better,\" said Joe in a weak voice.\n \n  \"Maybe you need another dose,\" Harvey suggested.\n \n  Joe recoiled. \"I'm fine now!\" he cried, and sprang off the bar to prove\nit.\n \n  Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face,\nand then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.\n \n  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" Johnson ejaculated.\n \n  \"\nLa-anago Yergis\nnever fails, my friend,\" Harvey explained. \"By\nactual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three\nminutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught\nthis one before it grew formidable.\"\n \n  The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. \"If you\ndon't charge too much,\" he said warily, \"I might think of buying some.\"\n \n  \"We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,\" Harvey replied with dignity.\n\"It sells itself.\"\n \n  \"'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole\ncase,\" said Johnson.\n \n  \"That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with\nthe vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.\"\n \n  \"How much?\" asked the mayor unhappily.\n \n  \"For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred\nbuckos.\"\n \n  Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of\ndoing so. \"F-four hundred,\" he offered.\n \n  \"Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,\" Harvey said flatly.\n \n  \"Make it four fifty,\" quavered Johnson.\n \n  \"I dislike haggling,\" said Harvey.\n \n  The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos and\nfifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: \"And we will include,\ngratis\n, an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian\nhandicraftsmanship.\"\n \n  Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. \"No tricks now. I want a taste of\nthat stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.\"\n \n  Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The\nmayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuing\nminute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle which\nthe man gradually won.\n \n  \"There ain't no words for that taste,\" he gulped when it was safe to\ntalk again.\n \n  \"Medicine,\" Harvey propounded, \"should taste like medicine.\" To Joe he\nsaid: \"Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to\nwhich we have dedicated ourselves.\"\n \n  With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the\nclearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped\nhis murderous silence and cried:\n \n  \"What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that\nsnake oil?\"\n \n  \"That was not poison,\" Harvey contradicted quietly. \"It was\nLa-anago\nYergis\nextract, plus.\"\n \n  \"Plus what—arsenic?\"\n \n  \"Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture\nour specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling\nyonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case,\nmind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had been\nswindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit have\nbeen, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.\"\n \n  \"But why use it on me?\" Joe demanded furiously.\n \n  Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. \"Did Johnson ask to\ntaste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce\nthe same\nmedicine\nthat we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a\nguinea pig for a splendid cause.\"\n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" Joe said. \"But you shoulda charged him more.\"\n \n  \"Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which\nthat swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he\npossesses. We could not be content with less.\"\n \n  \"Well, we're starting all right,\" admitted Joe. \"How about that thing\nwith six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?\"\n \n  Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.\n \n  \"I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.\nApparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.\nAt first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with our\nstreamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolic\nsuckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on the\naudio-visiphone. Then our triumph—we shall sell him at a stupendous\nfigure to the zoo!\"\nJoe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried\nthe case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared a\nplace of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it\ndown carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gave\nhim, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been at\nleast as good as the first; he gagged.\n \n  \"That's the stuff, all right,\" he said, swallowing hard. He counted\nout the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously\nbalanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain\nat paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,\nand asked: \"You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.\"\n \n  Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking about\nfood at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.\n \n  \"It's only water we were short of,\" Harvey said apprehensively. \"We've\ngot rations back at the ship.\"\n \n  \"\nH-mph!\n\" the mayor grunted. \"Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.\nSuit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcome\nto our hospitality.\"\n \n  \"Your hospitality,\" said Harvey, \"depends on the prices you charge.\"\n \n  \"Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying,\" answered\nthe mayor promptly. \"What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here you\ncan't get anywhere else for any price.\"\n \n  Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He saw\nnone.\n \n  \"Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe,\" he said guardedly.\n \n  Johnson immediately fell into the role of \"mine host.\"\n \n  \"Come right in, gents,\" he invited. \"Right into the dining room.\"\n \n  He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more or\nless private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was little\nchance of company.\n \n  Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen with\ntwo menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,\nsilverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,\nwhich were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.\n \n  Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were\nphenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he\ngrinned, bowed and asked: \"Everything satisfactory, gents?\"\n \n  \"Quite,\" said Harvey. \"We shall order.\"\n \n  For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the\nculinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service\nwas as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played\ndeftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian\nviotars\n, using his other two\nhands for waiting on the table.\n \n  \"We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,\" Harvey\nwhispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the\nkitchen, attending to the next course. \"He would make any society\nhostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum\nto women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.\"\n \n  \"Think of a fast one fast,\" Joe agreed. \"You're right.\"\n \n  \"But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,\"\ncomplained Harvey. \"I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honest\nmerchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate\nour check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.\"\n \n  The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.\n \n  \"It's been a great honor, gents,\" he said. \"Ain't often I have\nvisitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.\"\n \n  As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and\nHarvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in\na yelp of horror.\n \n  \"What the devil is this?\" he shouted.—\"How do you arrive at this\nfantastic, idiotic figure—\nthree hundred and twenty-eight buckos\n!\"\nJohnson didn't answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,\nnot a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty\nfingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu.\n \n  Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with\nrage. The minute note read: \"Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80\nredsents.\"\n \n  \"You can go to hell!\" Joe growled. \"We won't pay it!\"\n \n  Johnson sighed ponderously. \"I was afraid you'd act like that,\" he said\nwith regret. He pulled a tin badge out of his rear pocket, pinned it on\nhis vest, and twisted his holstered gun into view. \"Afraid I'll have to\nask the sheriff to take over.\"\n \n  Johnson, the \"sheriff,\" collected the money, and Johnson, the\n\"restaurateur,\" pocketed it. Meanwhile, Harvey tipped Joe the sign to\nremain calm.\n \n  \"My friend,\" he said to the mayor, and his tones took on a\nschoolmasterish severity, \"your long absence from Earth has perhaps\nmade you forget those elements of human wisdom that have entered the\nfolk-lore of your native planet. Such as, for example: 'It is folly\nto kill a goose that lays golden eggs,' and 'Penny wise is pound\nfoolish.'\"\n \n  \"I don't get the connection,\" objected Johnson.\n \n  \"Well, by obliging us to pay such a high price for your dinner, you put\nout of your reach the chance of profiting from a really substantial\ndeal. My partner and I were prepared to make you a sizable offer for\nthe peculiar creature you call Genius. But by reducing our funds the\nway you have—\"\n \n  \"Who said I wanted to sell him?\" the mayor interrupted. He rubbed his\nfingers together and asked disinterestedly: \"What were you going to\noffer, anyhow?\"\n \n  \"It doesn't matter any longer,\" Harvey said with elaborate\ncarelessness. \"Perhaps you wouldn't have accepted it, anyway.\"\n \n  \"That's right,\" Johnson came back emphatically. \"But what would your\noffer have been which I would have turned down?\"\n \n  \"Which one? The one we were going to make, or the one we can make now?\"\n \n  \"Either one. It don't make no difference. Genius is too valuable to\nsell.\"\n \n  \"Oh, come now, Mr. Johnson. Don't tell me no amount of money would\ntempt you!\"\n \n  \"Nope. But how much did you say?\"\n \n  \"Ah, then you will consider releasing Genius!\"\n \n  \"Well, I'll tell you something,\" said the mayor confidentially. \"When\nyou've got one thing, you've got one thing. But when you've got money,\nit's the same as having a lot of things. Because, if you've got money,\nyou can buy this and that and this and that and—\"\n \n  \"This and that,\" concluded Joe. \"We'll give you five hundred buckos.\"\n \n  \"Now, gents!\" Johnson remonstrated. \"Why, six hundred would hardly—\"\n \n  \"You haven't left us much money,\" Harvey put in.\n \n  The mayor frowned. \"All right, we'll split the difference. Make it\nfive-fifty.\"\n \n  Harvey was quick to pay out, for this was a genuine windfall. Then he\nstood up and admired the astonishing possession he had so inexpensively\nacquired.\n \n  \"I really hate to deprive you of this unique creature,\" he said to\nJohnson. \"I should imagine you will be rather lonely, with only your\nfilial mammoth to keep you company.\"\n \n  \"I sure will,\" Johnson confessed glumly. \"I got pretty attached to\nGenius, and I'm going to miss him something awful.\"\n \n  Harvey forcibly removed his eyes from the native, who was clearing off\nthe table almost all at once.\n \n  \"My friend,\" he said, \"we take your only solace, it is true, but in his\nplace we can offer something no less amazing and instructive.\"\n \n  The mayor's hand went protectively to his pocket. \"What is it?\" he\nasked with the suspicion of a man who has seen human nature at its\nworst and expects nothing better.\n \n  \"Joseph, get our most prized belonging from the communications room of\nthe ship,\" Harvey instructed. To Johnson he explained: \"You must see\nthe wondrous instrument before its value can be appreciated. My partner\nwill soon have it here for your astonishment.\"\n \n  Joe's face grew as glum as Johnson's had been. \"Aw, Harv,\" he\nprotested, \"do we have to sell it? And right when I thought we were\ngetting the key!\"\n \n  \"We must not be selfish, my boy,\" Harvey said nobly. \"We have had our\nchance; now we must relinquish Fate to the hands of a man who might\nhave more success than we. Go, Joseph. Bring it here.\"\n \n  Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.\nOn a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity\nwould probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with\nquestions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For\nhis part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba\nuntil Joe came in, lugging a radio.\n \n  \"Is that what you were talking about?\" the mayor snorted. \"What makes\nyou think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and\npolitical speech-makers.\"\n \n  \"Do not jump to hasty conclusions,\" Harvey cautioned. \"Another word,\nand I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,\nwith the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor\nof this absolutely awe-inspiring device.\"\n \n  \"I ain't in the market for a radio,\" Johnson said stubbornly.\n \n  Harvey nodded in relief. \"We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.\nHe has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our\nstudy, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an\nenormous fortune.\"\n \n  \"Well, that's no plating off our bow,\" Joe grunted. \"I'm glad he did\nturn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole\nyears.\"\n \n  He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.\n \n  \"Now, hold on!\" the mayor cried. \"I ain't\nsaying\nI'll buy, but what\nis it I'm turning down?\"\n \n  Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face\nsorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.\n \n  \"To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"Joseph and I were among\nthe chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before\nhis tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.\" He\nbanged his fist on the bar. \"I have said it before, and I repeat again,\nthat was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit\nhis greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!\"\n \n  \"This what?\" Johnson blurted out.\n \n  \"In simple terms,\" clarified Harvey, \"the ingenious doctor discovered\nthat the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by\nenergy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the\ninhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than\nourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would\nfind himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!\"\n \n  The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.\n \n  \"And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?\"\n \n  \"It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor\nDean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.\"\n \n  The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared\nthoughtfully at the battered cabinet.\n \n  \"Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,\" he\nconceded. \"But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks up\nthere wouldn't talk our language.\"\n \n  Again Harvey smashed his fist down. \"Do you dare to repeat the scurvy\nlie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?\"\n \n  Johnson recoiled. \"No—no,\nof course not\n. I mean, being up here, I\nnaturally couldn't get all the details.\"\n \n  \"Naturally,\" Harvey agreed, mollified. \"I'm sorry I lost my temper.\nBut it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts\nemanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be\nso difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was\ncommunication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired\nour language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own\nhyper-scientific trimmings?\"\n \n  \"Why, I don't know,\" Johnson said in confusion.\n \n  \"For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect\nthe simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed\nbroadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor\nfailed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could\nstand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to\nsolve the mystery caused him to take his own life.\"\n \n  Johnson winced. \"Is that what you want to unload on me?\"\n \n  \"For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be\nrewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who\ncould devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a\nperson with unusual patience.\"\n \n  \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain't exactly flighty.\"\n \n  \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\"\n \n  Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\"\nHarvey turned a knob on the face of the scarred radio. After several\nsqueals of spatial figures, a smooth voice began:\n \n  \"There are omnious pleajes of moby-hailegs in sonmirand which,\nhowgraismon, are notch to be donfured miss ellasellabell in either or\nboth hagasanipaj, by all means. This does not refly, on the brother\nman, nat or mizzafil saces are denuded by this ossifaligo....\"\n \n  Harvey switched off the set determinedly.\n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" Johnson begged. \"I almost got it then!\"\n \n  \"I dislike being commercial,\" said Harvey, \"but this astounding device\nstill belongs to us. Would we not be foolish to let you discover the\nclue before purchasing the right to do so?\"\n \n  The mayor nodded indecisively, looking at the radio with agonized\nlonging. \"How much do you want?\" he asked unhappily.\n \n  \"One thousand buckos, and no haggling. I am not in the mood.\"\n \n  Johnson opened his mouth to argue; then, seeing Harvey's set features,\npaid with the worst possible grace.\n \n  \"Don't you think we ought to tell him about the batteries, Harv?\" Joe\nasked.\n \n  \"What about the batteries?\" demanded Johnson with deadly calm.\n \n  \"A very small matter,\" Harvey said airily. \"You see, we have been\nanalyzing these broadcasts for three years. In that time, of course,\nthe batteries are bound to weaken. I estimate these should last not\nless than one Terrestrial month, at the very least.\"\n \n  \"What do I do then?\"\n \n  Harvey shrugged. \"Special batteries are required, which I see Joseph\nhas by chance brought along. For the batteries, the only ones of their\nkind left in the system, I ask only what they cost—one hundred and\nninety-nine buckos, no more and, on the other hand, no less.\"\n \n  Johnson was breathing hard, and his hand hovered dangerously near his\ngun. But he paid the amount Harvey wanted.\n \n  Moreover, he actually shook hands when the two panacea purveyors\ncollected their six-armed prize and said goodbye. Before they were\noutside, however, he had turned on the radio and was listening tensely\nto a woman's highly cultured, though rather angry voice, saying:\n \n  \"Oh, you hannaforge are all beasa-taga-sanimort. If you rue amount it,\nhow do you respench a pure woman to ansver go-samak—\"\n \n  \"I'll get it!\" they heard Johnson mutter.\n \n  Then the sound of giant feet crossing the barroom floor reached their\nears, and a shrill question: \"What's that, Papa?\"\n \n  \"A fortune, Jed! Those fakers are damned fools, selling us a thing\nlike—\"\n \n  Joe gazed at Harvey admiringly. \"Another one sold? Harv, that spiel\npulls them in like an ether storm!\"\n \n  Together with the remarkable planetoid man, they reached the ship.\nAbove them, dark, tumbling shapes blotted out the stars and silently\nmoved on. Joe opened the gangway door.\n \n  \"Come on in, pal,\" he said to Genius. \"We're shoving off.\"\n \n  The planetoid man grinned foolishly. \"Can't go arong with you,\" he said\nwith an apologetic manner. \"I rike to, but pressure fratten me out if I\ngo.\"\n \n  \"What in solar blazes are you talking about?\" Harvey asked.\n \n  \"I grow up on pranetoid,\" Genius explained. \"On big pranet, too much\npressure for me.\"\n \n  The two salesmen looked narrowly at each other.\n \n  \"Did Johnson know that when he sold you?\" Joe snarled.\n \n  \"Oh, sure.\" The silly grin became wider than ever. \"Peopre from Earth\nbuy me rots of times. I never reave pranetoid, though.\"\n \n  \"Joseph,\" Harvey said ominously, \"that slick colonist has put one over\nupon us. What is our customary procedure in that event?\"\n \n  \"We tear him apart,\" Joe replied between his teeth.\n \n  \"Not Mister Johnson,\" advised Genius. \"Have gun and badge. He shoot you\nfirst and then rock you up in prison.\"\n \n  Harvey paused, his ominous air vanishing. \"True. There is also the\nfact, Joseph, that when he discovers the scrambled rectifier in\nthe radio we sold him, he will have been paid back in full for his\nregrettable dishonesty.\"\nUnwillingly, Joe agreed. While Genius retreated to a safe distance,\nthey entered the ship and blasted off. Within a few minutes the\nautomatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of the\nasteroid belt.\n \n  \"I got kind of dizzy,\" Joe said, \"there were so many deals back and\nforth. How much did we make on the sucker?\"\n \n  \"A goodly amount, I wager,\" Harvey responded. He took out a pencil and\npaper. \"Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199. Total—let's\nsee—1668 buckos and 50 redsents. A goodly sum, as I told you.\"\n \n  He emptied his pockets of money, spread it out on the astrogation table\nand began counting. Finished, he looked up, troubled.\n \n  \"How much did we have when we landed, Joseph?\"\n \n  \"Exactly 1668 buckos,\" Joe answered promptly.\n \n  \"I can't understand it,\" said Harvey. \"Instead of double our capital,\nwe now have only 1668 buckos and 50 redsents!\"\n \n  Feverishly, he returned to his pencil and paper.\n \n  \"Drinking water, 790; battery water, free; meal, 328; planetoid man,\n550. Total: 1668 buckos!\" He stared at the figures. \"We paid out almost\nas much as we took in,\" he said bitterly. \"Despite our intensive\nefforts, we made the absurd sum of fifty redsents.\"\n \n  \"Why, the dirty crook!\" Joe growled.\n \n  But after a few moments of sad reflection, Harvey became philosophical.\n\"Perhaps, Joseph, we are more fortunate than we realize. We were,\nafter all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more\nI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty\nredsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.\"\n \n  Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly\nand asked: \"Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?\"\n \n  \"Certainly,\" Harvey explained. \"What about it?\"\n \n  \"How much did it cost us?\"\n \n  Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're\nright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after\nall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\"\n \n  \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\"\n \n  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on\nMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\"\n \n  \"\nGoldbricks!\n\" Harvey said succinctly.\n \n  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "8e4f16bfbb2d4463b4f7ad22c6b96883", "response_text": "Joe and Harvey land on Planetoid 42 and enter a bar.

Johnson sells his worker for a little over half a thousand buckos. Despite selling him to Harvey and Joe, Johnson forgot to include one minute detail. Genius is unable to leave their small planet, due to the gravity he grew up on. Any bigger atmospheric pressure would crush him. \nGenius is yet another example of the many cons Johnson pulled on Harvey and Joe.\n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "efcb434e9363466092f221030ab91140", "response_text": "The character of Genius acts as a symbol of the things that visitors do not understand about Planetoid 42, and how Johnson uses this to his advantage when he tries to make money off of visitors.

For instance, there is no reason to assume that Genius is able to speak based on the majority of the story, but once he arrived at Joe and Harvey’s ship he explains to them that he cannot go with them.

This is how he originally sells them on the idea that he has to charge for water, but it is not his only tactic. He presents them with a menu that has very inexpensive prices for food, but does not mention the extremely small print on the bottom of the menu that shows an exorbitant service charge for the entertainment. These types of ploys have something in common: he tries to set up a situation to make it look very normal for his environment on the planetoid, but hides the information necessary for visitors to make an informed decision. This includes selling Genius near the end of the story, which is a con he has apparently run many times.

EVERYTHING IT HAD WAS\n \n \n IN THE GARDEN\n \n\n BY R. A. LAFFERTY\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there be life traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. So they skipped several steps in the procedure.\n \n The chordata discerner read Positive over most of the surface. There was spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omitted several tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thought on the body?\n \n Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; it required a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they found nothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Then it came—clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only.\n \n \"Limited,\" said Steiner, \"as though within a pale. As though there were but one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of the surface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hours before it's back in our ken if we let it go now.\"\n \n \"Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest of the world to make sure we've missed nothing,\" said Stark.\n \n There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult of analysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This was designed simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this might be so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and the designer of it were puzzled as to how to read the results.\n \n The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locator had refused to read Positive when turned on the inventor himself, bad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he had extraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. He told the machine so heatedly.\n \n The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, that Glaser did not have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinary perception to an extraordinary degree. There is a difference , the machine insisted.\n \n It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but built others more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the owners of Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.\n \n And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (or Eppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read Positive on a number of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could not even read music. But it had also read Positive on ninety per cent of the acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been a sound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Mi it had read Positive on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out of billions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at all was shown by the test.\n \n So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the area and got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently one individual, though this could not be certain) and got very definite action. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, and assumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.\n \n Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it ever produces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrug of the shoulders in a man. They called it the \"You tell me light.\"\n \n So among the intelligences there was at least one that might be extraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to be forewarned.\n \n \n\n \n \"Scan the remainder of the world, Steiner,\" said Stark, \"and the rest of us will get some sleep. If you find no other spot then we will go down on that one the next time it is in position under us, in about twelve hours.\"\n \n \"You don't want to visit any of the other areas first? Somewhere away from the thoughtful creature?\"\n \n \"No. The rest of the world may be dangerous. There must be a reason that thought is in one spot only. If we find no others then we will go down boldly and visit this.\"\n \n So they all, except Steiner, went off to their bunks then: Stark, the Captain; Gregory Gilbert, the executive officer; Wolfgang Langweilig, the engineer; Casper Craig, super-cargo, tycoon and 51% owner of the Little Probe, and F. R. Briton, S.J., a Jesuit priest who was linguist and checker champion of the craft.\n \n Dawn did not come to the moon-town. The Little Probe hovered stationary in the light and the moon-town came up under the dawn. Then the Probe went down to visit whatever was there.\n \n \"There's no town,\" said Steiner. \"Not a building. Yet we're on the track of the minds. There's nothing but a meadow and some boscage, a sort of fountain or pool, and four streams coming out of it.\"\n \n \"Keep on towards the minds,\" said Stark. \"They're our target.\"\n \n \"Not a building, not two sticks or stones placed together. That looks like an Earth-type sheep there. And that looks like an Earth-lion, I'm almost afraid to say. And those two ... why, they could well be Earth-people. But with a difference. Where is that bright light coming from?\"\n \n \"I don't know, but they're right in the middle of it. Land here. We'll go to meet them at once. Timidity has never been an efficacious tool with us.\"\n \n Well, they were people. And one could only wish that all people were like them. There was a man and a woman, and they were clothed either in very bright garments or in no garments at all, but only in a very bright light.\n \n \"Talk to them, Father Briton,\" said Stark. \"You are the linguist.\"\n \n \"Howdy,\" said the priest.\n \n He may or may not have been understood, but the two of them smiled at him, so he went on.\n \n \"Father Briton from Philadelphia,\" he said, \"on detached service. And you, my good man, what is your handle, your monicker, your tag?\"\n \n \"Ha-Adamah,\" said the man.\n \n \"And your daughter, or niece?\"\n \n It may be that the shining man frowned momentarily at this; but the woman smiled, proving that she was human.\n \n \"The woman is named Hawwah,\" said the man. \"The sheep is named sheep, the lion is named lion, the horse is named horse and the hoolock is named hoolock.\"\n \n \"I understand. It is possible that this could go on and on. How is it that you use the English tongue?\"\n \n \"I have only one tongue; but it is given to us to be understood by all; by the eagle, by the squirrel, by the ass, by the English.\"\n \n \"We happen to be bloody Yankees, but we use a borrowed tongue. You wouldn't have a drink on you for a tubful of thirsty travellers, would you?\"\n \n \"The fountain.\"\n \n \"Ah—I see.\"\n \n \n\n \n But the crew all drank of the fountain to be sociable. It was water, but water that excelled, cool and with all its original bubbles like the first water ever made.\n \n \"What do you make of them?\" asked Stark.\n \n \"Human,\" said Steiner. \"It may even be that they are a little more than human. I don't understand that light that surrounds them. And they seem to be clothed, as it were, in dignity.\"\n \n \"And very little else,\" said Father Briton, \"though that light trick does serve a purpose. But I'm not sure they'd pass in Philadelphia.\"\n \n \"Talk to them again,\" said Stark. \"You're the linguist.\"\n \n \"That isn't necessary here, Captain. Talk to them yourself.\"\n \n \"Are there any other people here?\" Stark asked the man.\n \n \"The two of us. Man and woman.\"\n \n \"But are there any others?\"\n \n \"How would there be any others? What other kind of people could there be than man and woman?\"\n \n \"But is there more than one man or woman?\"\n \n \"How could there be more than one of anything?\"\n \n The captain was a little puzzled by this, but he went on doggedly:\n\"Ha-Adamah, what do you think that we are? Are we not people?\"\n \n \"You are not anything till I name you. But I will name you and then you can be. You are named Captain. He is named Priest. He is named Engineer. He is named Flunky.\"\n \n \"Thanks a lot,\" said Steiner.\n \n \"But are we not people?\" persisted Captain Stark.\n \n \"No. We are the people. There are no people but two. How could there be other people?\"\n \n \"And the damnest thing about it,\" muttered Langweilig, \"is, how are you going to prove him wrong? But it does give you a small feeling.\"\n \n \"Can we have something to eat?\" asked the Captain.\n \n \"Pick from the trees,\" said Ha-Adamah, \"and then it may be that you will want to sleep on the grass. Being not of human nature (which does not need sleep or rest), it may be that you require respite. But you are free to enjoy the garden and its fruits.\"\n \n \"We will,\" said Captain Stark.\n \n They wandered about the place, but they were uneasy. There were the animals. The lion and lioness were enough to make one cautious, though they offered no harm. The two bears had a puzzling look, as though they wanted either to frolic with you or to mangle you.\n \n \"If there are only two people here,\" said Casper Craig, \"then it may be that the rest of the world is not dangerous at all. It looked fertile wherever we scanned it, though not so fertile as this central bit. And those rocks would bear examining.\"\n \n \"Flecked with gold, and possibly with something else,\" said Stark. \"A very promising site.\"\n \n \"And everything grows here,\" added Steiner. \"Those are Earth-fruits and I never saw finer. I've tasted the grapes and plums and pears. The figs and dates are superb, the quince is as flavorsome as a quince can be, the cherries are excellent. And I never did taste such oranges. But I haven't yet tried the—\" and he stopped.\n \n \"If you're thinking what I'm afraid to think,\" said Gilbert, \"then it will be the test at least: whether we're having a pleasant dream or whether this is reality. Go ahead and eat one.\"\n \n \"I won't be the first to eat one. You eat.\"\n \n \"Ask him first. You ask him.\"\n \n \"Ha-Adamah, is it allowed to eat the apples?\"\n \n \"Certainly. Eat. It is the finest fruit in the garden.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Well, the analogy breaks down there,\" said Stark. \"I was almost beginning to believe in the thing. But if it isn't that, then what. Father Briton, you are the linguist, but in Hebrew does not Ha-Adamah and Hawwah mean—?\"\n \n \"Of course they do. You know that as well as I.\"\n \n \"I was never a believer. But would it be possible for the exact same proposition to maintain here as on Earth?\"\n \n \"All things are possible.\"\n \n And it was then that Ha-Adamah, the shining man, gave a wild cry: \"No, no. Do not approach it. It is not allowed to eat of that one!\"\n \n It was the pomegranate tree, and he was warning Langweilig away from it.\n \n \"Once more, Father,\" said Stark, \"you should be the authority; but does not the idea that it was the apple that was forbidden go back only to a medieval painting?\"\n \n \"It does. The name of the fruit is not mentioned in Genesis. In Hebrew exegesis, however, the pomegranate is usually indicated.\"\n \n \"I thought so. Question the man further, Father. This is too incredible.\"\n \n \"It is a little odd. Adam, old man, how long have you been here?\"\n \n \"Forever less six days is the answer that has been given to me. I never did understand the answer, however.\"\n \n \"And have you gotten no older in all that time?\"\n \n \"I do not understand what 'older' is. I am as I have been from the beginning.\"\n \n \"And do you think that you will ever die?\"\n \n \"To die I do not understand. I am taught that it is a property of fallen nature to die, and that does not pertain to me or mine.\"\n \n \"And are you completely happy here?\"\n \n \"Perfectly happy according to my preternatural state. But I am taught that it might be possible to lose that happiness, and then to seek it vainly through all the ages. I am taught that sickness and ageing and even death could come if this happiness were ever lost. I am taught that on at least one other unfortunate world it has actually been lost.\"\n \n \"Do you consider yourself a knowledgeable man?\"\n \n \"Yes, since I am the only man, and knowledge is natural to man. But I am further blessed. I have a preternatural intellect.\"\n \n Then Stark cut in once more: \"There must be some one question you could ask him, Father. Some way to settle it. I am becoming nearly convinced.\"\n \n \"Yes, there is a question that will settle it. Adam, old man, how about a game of checkers?\"\n \n \"This is hardly the time for clowning,\" said Stark.\n \n \"I'm not clowning, Captain. How about it, Adam? I'll give you choice of colors and first move.\"\n \n \"No. It would be no contest. I have a preternatural intellect.\"\n \n \"Well, I beat a barber who was champion of Germantown. And I beat the champion of Morgan County, Tennessee, which is the hottest checker center on Earth. I've played against, and beaten, machines. But I never played a preternatural mind. Let's just set up the board, Adam, and have a go at it.\"\n \n \"No. It would be no contest. I would not like to humble you.\"\n \n \n\n \n They were there for three days. They were delighted with the place. It was a world with everything, and it seemed to have only two inhabitants. They went everywhere except into the big cave.\n \n \"What is there, Adam?\" asked Captain Stark.\n \n \"The great serpent lives there. I would not disturb him. He has long been cranky because plans he had for us did not materialize. But we are taught that should ever evil come to us, which it cannot if we persevere, it will come by him.\"\n \n They learned no more of the real nature of the sphere in their time there. Yet all but one of them were convinced of the reality when they left. And they talked of it as they took off.\n \n \"A crowd would laugh if told of it,\" said Stark, \"but not many would laugh if they had actually seen the place, or them. I am not a gullible man, but I am convinced of this: that this is a pristine and pure world and that ours and all the others we have visited are fallen worlds. Here are the prototypes of our first parents before their fall. They are garbed in light and innocence, and they have the happiness that we have been seeking for centuries. It would be a crime if anyone disturbed that happiness.\"\n \n \"I too am convinced,\" said Steiner. \"It is Paradise itself, where the lion lies down with the lamb, and where the serpent has not prevailed. It would be the darkest of crimes if we or others should play the part of the serpent, and intrude and spoil.\"\n \n \"I am probably the most skeptical man in the world,\" said Casper Craig the tycoon, \"but I do believe my eyes. I have been there and seen it. It is indeed an unspoiled Paradise; and it would be a crime calling to the wide heavens for vengeance for anyone to smirch in any way that perfection.\n \n \"So much for that. Now to business. Gilbert, take a gram: Ninety Million Square Miles of Pristine Paradise for Sale or Lease. Farming, Ranching, exceptional opportunities for Horticulture. Gold, Silver, Iron, Earth-Type Fauna. Terms. Special Rates for Large Settlement Parties. Write, Gram, or call in person at any of our planetary offices as listed below. Ask for Brochure—Eden Acres Unlimited.\"\n \n \n\n \n Down in the great cave that Old Serpent, a two-legged one among whose names were \"Snake-Oil Sam,\" spoke to his underlings:\n \n \"It'll take them fourteen days to get back with the settlers. We'll have time to overhaul the blasters. We haven't had any well-equipped settlers for six weeks. It used to be we'd hardly have time to strip and slaughter and stow before there was another batch to take care of.\"\n \n \"I think you'd better write me some new lines,\" said Adam. \"I feel like a goof saying those same ones to each bunch.\"\n \n \"You are a goof, and therefore perfect for the part. I was in show business long enough to know never to change a line too soon. I did change Adam and Eve to Ha-Adamah and Hawwah, and the apple to the pomegranate. People aren't becoming any smarter—but they are becoming better researched, and they insist on authenticity.\n \n \"This is still a perfect come-on here. There is something in human nature that cannot resist the idea of a Perfect Paradise. Folks will whoop and holler to their neighbors to come in droves to spoil and mar it. It isn't greed or the desire for new land so much—though that is strong too. Mainly it is the feverish passion to befoul and poison what is unspoiled. Fortunately I am sagacious enough to take advantage of this trait. And when you start to farm a new world on a shoestring you have to acquire your equipment as you can.\"\n \n He looked proudly around at the great cave with its mountains and tiers of materials, heavy machinery of all sorts, titanic crates of foodstuff space-sealed; wheeled, tracked, propped, vaned and jetted vehicles; and power packs to run a world.\n \n He looked at the three dozen space ships stripped and stacked, and at the rather large pile of bone-meal in one corner.\n \n \"We will have to have another lion,\" said Eve. \"Bowser is getting old, and Marie-Yvette abuses him and gnaws his toes. And we do have to have a big-maned lion to lie down with the lamb.\"\n \n \"I know it, Eve. The lion is a very important prop. Maybe one of the crackpot settlers will bring a new lion.\"\n \n \"And can't you mix another kind of shining paint? This itches.

Financing our specialty—\"\n \n \"And you had better have an armed escort when you return,\" said Father Briton.\n \n \"Why in cosmos would we want an armed escort?\"\n \n \"It's as phony as a seven-credit note!\"\n \n \"You, a man of the cloth doubt it? And us ready skeptics convinced by our senses? Why do you doubt?\"\n \n \"It is only the unbelieving who believe so easily in obvious frauds.

When they approach the surface, they recognize various animals that look familiar from life on Earth, including sheep and lions, but there is a bright light they don’t understand the source of. Briton, the priest, is also a linguist so he approaches the two people that they find, and is surprised when he is easily understood.

The woman on the surface, Hawwah, does not speak while the crew is there. These two are the only humanoids that the crew notices, and they find that the bright light seems to be coming from the people themselves. The main features on the surface are a large garden and a fountain, and the crew is struck by the resemblance to the biblical story of Adam and Eve. They test the boundaries of the similarities by asking to eat apples, which they are told is fine, but then find that pomegranates are not allowed to be consumed. This does not discount the similarity, as some versions of the story say that pomegranates were the forbidden fruit, and the crew is even more baffled when they hear that there is a serpent there that is the source of evil: they do not meet him, as he is in a cave. After three days on the surface, with Father Briton asking questions all the while, the crew goes back to the Little Prob where they discuss what they had witnessed. Stark was astounded at the purity of the world, and thought it needed to be protected, as did Steiner. Craig, the tycoon who owns 51% of the probe, admitted it was beautiful and would be terrible to ruin, but immediately works on dictating a message to Gilbert, the executive officer, advertising the moon to those who might want to buy or lease land there.

Yet the doorman had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by eight.”\n \n \n Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time without justifying it.\n \n \n Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat down at Baron’s table. He was short and wiry. His face held no key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still healing.\n \n \n The stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re planning to attempt the Brightside.”\n \n \n Baron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read telecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going to make a Brightside Crossing.”\n \n \n “At perihelion?”\n \n \n “Of course. When else?”\n \n \n The grizzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment without expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re not going to make the Crossing.”\n \n \n “Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded.\n \n \n “The name is Claney,” said the stranger.\n \n \n There was a silence. Then: “Claney? Peter Claney?”\n \n \n “That’s right.”\n \n \n Baron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger gone. “Great balls of fire, man— where have you been hiding? We’ve been trying to contact you for months!”\n \n \n “I know. I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the whole idea.”\n \n \n “Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My friend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking. Here, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His fingers were trembling.\n \n \n Peter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you want to hear.”\n \n \n “But you’ve got to. You’re the only man on Earth who’s attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the story you cleared for the news—it was nothing. We need details . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a finger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma? Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make it across where your attempt failed—”\n \n \n “You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney.\n \n \n “Of course we want to know. We have to know.”\n \n \n “It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t do it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.”\n \n \n “Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.”\n \n \n Claney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You can blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in both quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting. It was the planet that whipped us, that and the Sun . They’ll whip you, too, if you try it.”\n \n \n “Never,” said Baron.\n \n \n “Let me tell you,” Peter Claney said.\n \n \n\n I’d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as I can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082, I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n \n \n I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my blood, sure as death.\n \n \n But it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American. He was a major in the Interplanetary Service for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up his commission.\n \n \n He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days, did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n \n \n I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool, the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck, with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind of personality that could take a crew of wild men and make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n \n \n He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury, and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the year—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since Venus and what my plans were.\n \n \n “No particular plans,” I told him. “Why?”\n \n \n He looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?”\n \n \n I told him one-thirty-five.\n \n \n “That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on you, at any rate. How do you take heat?”\n \n \n “You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.”\n \n \n “No, I mean real heat.”\n \n \n Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”\n \n \n “That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be dangerous, too.”\n \n \n “What trip?”\n \n \n “Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.\n \n \n I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”\n \n \n He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion? What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then, nobody’s got Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”\n \n \n I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in. That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the surface of the Sun itself.\n \n \n It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned just how hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody would cross it.\n \n \n I wanted to be along.\n \n \n\n The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed the Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years before.\n \n \n Twilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside, of course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could hold his observatory. He’d chosen a good location, too. On Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent installation with a human crew could survive at either extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival temperatures.\n \n \n Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet to wheel around.\n \n \n The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab to make final preparations.\n \n \n Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier. Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside was like.\n \n \n Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed him around like a puppy.\n \n \n It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check and test.\n \n \n We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson. We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models, with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in, and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n \n \n The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”\n \n \n “Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.\n \n \n “He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name for climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve probably heard of him.”\n \n \n I’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t too happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil, isn’t he?”\n \n \n “Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the line? We’ll need plenty of both.”\n \n \n “Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.\n \n \n “No. Are you worried?”\n \n \n “Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.”\n \n \n The Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the trip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to do any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list.\n“Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says we should leave in three days.”\n \n \n Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline of our course.\n \n \n “This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But these to the south and west could be active. Seismograph tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse down toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface shifting.”\n \n \n Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant surface activity.”\n \n \n The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”\n \n \n It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the further we got from a solution. We knew there were active volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and localized.\n \n \n But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside millennia ago—but there was CO\n 2\n , and nitrogen, and traces of other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n \n \n The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way we would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n \n \n Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and he couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited.\n \n \n He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed, sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness. And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n \n \n Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening, Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was set for an early departure after we got some rest.\n \n \n\n “And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”\n \n \n Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”\n \n \n “Of course.”\n \n \n Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t our big problem right then. Equipment worried us first and route next.”\n \n \n Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you have?”\n \n \n “The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at\n770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders if the suits failed somewhere.”\n \n \n “How about the Bugs?”\n \n \n “They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on them too much for protection.”\n \n \n “You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”\n \n \n “We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”\n \n \n Baron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass as he set it down on the tablecloth.\n \n \n “Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?”\n \n \n “Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right. We just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m getting to that.”\n \n \n He settled back in his chair and continued.\n \n \n\n We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest approach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of the planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n \n \n The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job was only half done—we would still have to travel another two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship, approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n \n \n That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew that.\n \n \n The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n“Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of dragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty closely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point. If there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?”\n \n \n McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack and I were planning to change around. We figured he could take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.”\n \n \n The Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that, Jack?”\n \n \n Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—”\n \n \n McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It doesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does it make any difference?”\n \n \n “I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank Peter along with me. Right?”\n \n \n “Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going to do the advance scouting?”\n \n \n “It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead Bug light as possible.”\n \n \n Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down to the frame and wheels.”\n \n \n McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the advance work. You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?” He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up ahead?”\n \n \n “That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said sharply.\n \n \n “Charts! I’m talking about detail work. We don’t need to worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you can’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts down excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column. I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws. Then—”\n \n \n “No dice,” the Major broke in.\n \n \n “But why not? We could save ourselves days!”\n \n \n “I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man alone—any time, any place.”\n \n \n McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.”\n \n \n “Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff. We’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together. Got that?”\n \n \n McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and we nodded, too.\n \n \n “All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight, let’s go.”\n \n \n It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of the Twilight Lab.\n \n \n I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them, Stone dragged the sledges.\n \n \n Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for the first twenty miles.\n \n \n I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out the track the early research teams had made out into the edge of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to bite.\n \n \n We didn’t feel the heat so much those first days out. We saw it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n \n \n We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks. The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates, bulk gelatin, vitamins.\n \n \n The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise. We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it happened to be so.\n \n \n We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches, but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers for one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n \n \n After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made Earth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden. Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge, with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous gases.\n \n \n It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there, so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\n \n \n Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered before, except for that Sun. We’d fought absolute cold before and won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun itself.\n \n \n Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would get us. That was the bargain.\n \n \n I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods. The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their sides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n \n \n We couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot, sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous surface for the Bug’s pillow tires.\n \n \n I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with light copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly, at first.\n \n \n Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to think so, too.\n \n \n McIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves. He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route now and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n \n \n Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but I figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive enough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n \n \n And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the end of an eight-hour trek.\n \n \n But it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we heard a sharp cry through our earphones.\n \n \n I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand horrible pictures racing through our minds....\n \n \n We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge and, for once, he didn’t have anything to say. It was the wreck of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that hadn’t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the fiberglass helmets.\n \n \n This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on their Brightside Crossing.\n \n \n\n On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change. It looked the same, but every now and then it felt different. On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch; I gunned my motor and nothing happened.\n \n \n I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs, thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the tractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\n \n \n I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous. I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed McIvers’ scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn’t like it.\n \n \n One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking much about the others. I was worried about me , plenty worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me. It wasn’t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn’t get the thought out of my mind.\n \n \n It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in the Bug again, we moved still more slowly—edging out on a broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks—winding back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on solid rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond a deep crack.\n \n \n I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.\n \n \n There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing; a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the ledge shift over a few feet.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "6", "uid": "d624859e69234bba96888a00c6e99637", "response_text": "James Baron is planning a trek to Brightside Crossing on Mercury, a feat so far unaccomplished. Few had tried, and those that did died. All except for one. He is asked to wait at the Red Baron as someone wanted to see him at 8. He waits patiently and is rewarded with the company of Peter Claney, the man who made it back home. Claney instantly tells him to give up on the journey and stay on Earth. Baron asks for details about their trek and what went wrong, but Claney refuses to give him the details. Claney is an older man now with an epithelioma on his face. Although he came to warn him, he quickly learns that Baron may only listen if he hears the truth. So Claney recounts the story. \nMajor Tom Mikuta recruited Claney, Jack Stone, and Ted McIvers to join him. They were to adventure to the Brightside Crossing at perihelion, a more dangerous journey. Temperatures reached up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit at perihelion, but Mikuta was an all-or-nothing man. Stone arrived on Mercury first, soon followed by Mikuta and Claney. McIvers was the last to arrive and they left soon after with three Bugs and one tractor dragging the sledges. Stone was briefed by Sanderson, the head of the observatory, before they left, and the men pored over all images and maps of the Crossing before beginning. \nDespite their high-tech spacesuits and general gadgets, the giant sun still got to them. They were constantly thirsty and hot, and their skin itched and burned. They drove for eight hours, then slept for five. They needed to travel 70 miles a day.

It’s impossible. \n\nClaney explains that a major named Tom Mikuta recruited him to go on the trip. Major wanted to cross the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion, except he wanted to cross the entire surface of the planet. Claney admits he was afraid because he knew the story of the last two explorers who never returned from their trip.

As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\nInterstellar Voice\n. And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\nInterstellar Voice\nand\nLarynx Incorporated\n. Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\nSo now here we were at the outer reaches of the Baldric, four travelers\non foot with only the barest necessities in the way of equipment and\nsupplies.\n \n  I walked forward to get a closer view of one of the flagpole trees. And\nthen abruptly I saw something else.\n \n  A queer-looking bird squatted there in the sand, looking up at me.\nSilver in plumage, it resembled a parrot with a crest; and yet it\ndidn't. In some strange way the thing was a hideous caricature.\n \n  \"Look what I found,\" I yelled.\n \n  \"What I found,\" said the cockatoo in a very human voice.\n \n  \"Thunder, it talks,\" I said amazed.\n \n  \"Talks,\" repeated the bird, blinking its eyes.\n \n  The cockatoo repeated my last statement again, then rose on its short\nlegs, flapped its wings once and soared off into the sky. Xartal,\nthe Martian illustrator, already had a notebook in his hands and was\nsketching a likeness of the creature.\n \n  Ten minutes later we were on the move again. We saw more silver\ncockatoos and more flagpole trees. Above us, the great disc of Jupiter\nbegan to descend toward the horizon.\n \n  And then all at once Grannie stopped again, this time at the top of a\nhigh ridge. She shielded her eyes and stared off into the plain we had\njust crossed.\n \n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said to me in a strange voice, \"look down there and\ntell me what you see.\"\n \n  I followed the direction of her hand and a shock went through me from\nhead to foot. Down there, slowly toiling across the sand, advanced a\nparty of four persons. In the lead was a little old lady in a black\ndress. Behind her strode a grizzled Earth man in a flop-brimmed hat,\nanother Earth man, and a Martian.\nDetail for detail they were a duplicate of ourselves!\n\"A mirage!\" said Ezra Karn.\n \n  But it wasn't a mirage. As the party came closer, we could see that\ntheir lips were moving, and their voices became audible. I listened in\nawe. The duplicate of myself was talking to the duplicate of Grannie\nAnnie, and she was replying in the most natural way.\n \n  Steadily the four travelers approached. Then, when a dozen yards away,\nthey suddenly faded like a negative exposed to light and disappeared.\n \n  \"What do you make of it?\" I said in a hushed voice.\n \n  Grannie shook her head. \"Might be a form of mass hypnosis superinduced\nby some chemical radiations,\" she replied. \"Whatever it is, we'd better\nwatch our step. There's no telling what might lie ahead.\"\n \n  We walked after that with taut nerves and watchful eyes, but we saw no\nrepetition of the \"mirage.\" The wind continued to blow ceaselessly, and\nthe sand seemed to grow more and more powdery.\n \n  For some time I had fixed my gaze on a dot in the sky which I supposed\nto be a high-flying cockatoo. As that dot continued to move across the\nheavens in a single direction, I called Grannie's attention to it.\n \n  \"It's a kite,\" she nodded. \"There should be a car attached to it\nsomewhere.\"\n \n  She offered no further explanation, but a quarter of an hour later as\nwe topped another rise a curious elliptical car with a long slanting\nwindscreen came into view. Attached to its hood was a taut wire which\nslanted up into the sky to connect with the kite.\n \n  A man was driving and when he saw us, he waved. Five minutes later\nGrannie was shaking his hand vigorously and mumbling introductions.\n \n  \"This is Jimmy Baker,\" she said. \"He manages\nLarynx Incorporated\n, and\nhe's the real reason we're here.\"\n \n  I decided I liked Baker the moment I saw him. In his middle thirties,\nhe was tall and lean, with pleasant blue eyes which even his sand\ngoggles could not conceal.\n \n  \"I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, Grannie,\" he said. \"If\nanybody can help me, you can.\"\n \n  Grannie's eyes glittered. \"Trouble with the mine laborers?\" she\nquestioned.\nJimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as we\nheaded back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on an\nelectric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently these\nadjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for the\ncar's ability to move in any direction.\n \n  \"If I weren't a realist, I'd say that\nLarynx Incorporated\nhas been\nbewitched,\" he began slowly. \"We pay our men high wages and give them\nexcellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.\nUp until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health and\nspirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.\"\n \n  \"Red Spot Fever?\" Grannie looked at him curiously.\n \n  Jimmy Baker nodded. \"The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousness\non the part of the patient. Then they disappear.\"\n \n  He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.\n \n  \"They walk out into the Baldric,\" he continued, \"and nothing can stop\nthem. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon as\nthey realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyes\nare turned, they give us the slip.\"\n \n  \"But surely you must have some idea of where they go,\" Grannie said.\n \n  Baker lit a cigarette. \"There's all kinds of rumors,\" he replied, \"but\nnone of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrie\nahead of us.\"\n \n  I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended between\na rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation of\ntranslucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos were\nperched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, but\nthey didn't move.\n \n  After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of\nLarynx Incorporated\n. As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,\na door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face was\ndrawn.\n \n  \"Mr. Baker,\" he said breathlessly, \"seventy-five workers at Shaft Four\nhave headed out into the Baldric.\"\n \n  Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.\n \n  \"Shaft Four, eh?\" he repeated. \"That's our principal mine. If the fever\nspreads there, I'm licked.\"\n \n  He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. Silent\nXartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got his\nnotebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remained\nstanding.\n \n  Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself to\nthe bottle of Martian whiskey there.\n \n  \"There must be ways of stopping this,\" she said. \"Have you called in\nany physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send the\nmen away until the plague has died down?\"\n \n  Baker shook his head. \"Three doctors from Callisto were here last\nmonth. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away,\nI may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company is\nchartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means. Failure\nto produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose all\nrights.\"\n \n  A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. A\nman's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said \"Okay\" and\nthrew off the switch.\n \n  \"The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric,\" he said\nslowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk.\nGrannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings.\n \n  \"Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where that\ncorridor is at its widest,\" she said.\n \n  Baker looked up. \"That's right. We only began operations there a\ncomparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix that\nruns deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of\nInterstellar Voice\n, our rival, in a year.\"\n \n  Grannie nodded. \"I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run up\nthere,\" she said. \"But first I want to see your laboratory.\"\n \n  There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lower\nlevel where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the length\nof the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and began\ndropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or four\nWellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a small\ndynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wire\nand other items.\n \n  The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and the\nMartian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began to\nroll down the ramp.\nNot until they had vanished in the desert haze did I sense the\nloneliness of this outpost. With that loneliness came a sudden sense of\nforeboding. Had I been a fool to let Grannie go? I thought of her, an\nold woman who should be in a rocking chair, knitting socks. If anything\nhappened to Annabella C. Flowers, I would never forgive myself and\nneither would her millions of readers.\n \n  Ezra Karn and I went back into the office. The old prospector chuckled.\n \n  \"Dang human dynamo. Got more energy than a runaway comet.\"\n \n  A connecting door on the far side of the office opened onto a long\ncorridor which ended at a staircase.\n \n  \"Let's look around,\" I said.\n \n  We passed down the corridor and climbed the staircase to the second\nfloor. Here were the general offices of\nLarynx Incorporated\n, and\nthrough glass doors I could see clerks busy with counting machines and\nreport tapes. In another chamber the extremely light Acoustix ore was\nbeing packed into big cases and marked for shipment. At the far end a\ndoor to a small room stood open. Inside a young man was tilted back in\na swivel chair before a complicated instrument panel.\n \n  \"C'mon in,\" he said, seeing us. \"If you want a look at your friends,\nhere they are.\"\n \n  He flicked a stud, and the entire wall above the panel underwent a\nslow change of colors. Those colors whirled kaleidescopically, then\ncoalesced into a three-dimensional scene.\n \n  It was a scene of a rapidly unfolding desert country as seen from the\nrear of a kite car. Directly behind the windscreen, backs turned to me,\nwere Jimmy Baker, Grannie, and Xartal. It was as if I were standing\ndirectly behind them.\n \n  \"It's Mr. Baker's own invention,\" the operator said. \"An improvement on\nthe visiphone.\"\n \n  \"Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and its\npassengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?\"\n \n  \"Sure.\" The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voice\nentered the room. It stopped abruptly. \"The machine uses a lot of\npower,\" the operator said, \"and as yet we haven't got much.\"\n \n  The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappeared\nsomewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myself\nposted of Grannie's movements.\n \n  Karn and I went down to the commissary where we ate our supper. When\nwe returned to Jimmy Baker's office, the visiphone bell was ringing.\nI went over to it and turned it on, and to my surprise the face of\nAntlers Park flashed on the screen.\n \n  \"Hello,\" he said in his friendly way. \"I see you arrived all right. Is\nMiss Flowers there?\"\n \n  \"Miss Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four,\" I said. \"There's\ntrouble up there. Red spot fever.\"\n \n  \"Fever, eh?\" repeated Park. \"That's a shame. Is there anything I can\ndo?\"\n \n  \"Tell me,\" I said, \"has your company had any trouble with this plague?\"\n \n  \"A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to the\nother side of the Baldric. We had one partial case, but my chemists\ngave the chap an antitoxin that seems to have worked. Come to think of\nit, I might drive over to Shaft Four and give Jimmy Baker the formula.\nI haven't been out in the Baldric for years, but if you didn't have any\ntrouble, I shouldn't either.\"\n \n  We exchanged a few more pleasantries, and then he rang off. In exactly\nan hour I went upstairs to the visiscreen room.\n \n  Then once more I was directly behind my friends, listening in on their\nconversation. The view through the windscreen showed an irregular array\nof flagpole trees, with the sky dotted by high-flying cockatoos.\n \n  \"There's an eyrie over there,\" Jimmy Baker was saying. \"We might as\nwell camp beside it.\"\nMoments later a rude circle of flagpole trees loomed ahead. Across the\ntop of them was stretched a translucent web. Jimmy and Grannie got out\nof the car and began making camp. Xartal remained in his seat. He was\ndrawing pictures on large pieces of pasteboard, and as I stood there in\nthe visiscreen room, I watched him.\n \n  There was no doubt about it, the Martian was clever. He would make\na few rapid lines on one of the pasteboards, rub it a little to get\nthe proper shading and then go on to the next. In swift rotation\nlikenesses of Ezra Karn, of myself, of Jimmy Baker, and of Antlers Park\ntook form.\n \n  Ezra spoke over my shoulder. \"He's doing scenes for Grannie's new\nbook,\" he said. \"The old lady figures on using the events here for a\nplot.\nLook at that damned nosy bird!\n\"\n \n  A silver cockatoo had alighted on the kite car and was surveying\ncuriously Xartal's work. As each drawing was completed, the bird\nscanned it with rapt attention. Abruptly it flew to the top of the\neyrie, where it seemed to be having a consultation with its bird\ncompanions.\n \n  And then abruptly it happened. The cockatoos took off in mass flight. A\ngroup of Earth people suddenly materialized on the eyrie, talking and\nmoving about as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n \n  With a shock I saw the likeness of myself; I saw Ezra Karn; and I saw\nthe image of Jimmy Baker.\n \n  The\nreal\nJimmy Baker stood next to Grannie, staring up at this\nincredible mirage. Grannie let out a whoop. \"I've got it!\" she said.\n\"Those things we see up there are nothing more than mental images.\nThey're Xartal's drawings!\"\n\"Don't you see,\" the lady continued. \"Everything that Xartal put on\npaper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoos\nare like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the power\nof copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mental\nimage of what they have seen. In other words their brains form a\npowerful photographic impression of the object. That impression is\nthen transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to common\nfoci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brain\nvibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the light\nfield to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.\"\n \n  The Larynx manager nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"But why don't the\nbirds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?\"\n \n  \"Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and\nmade a greater impression on their brains,\" Grannie replied.\n \n  Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicate\nof Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and the\nimage of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.\n \n  Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.\n \n  \"Sorry,\" the operator said. \"I've used too much power already. Have to\ngive the generators a chance to build it up again.\"\n \n  Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.\n \n  \"That explains something at any rate,\" the old prospector said. \"But\nhow about that Red spot fever?\"\n \n  On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I opened\nit and found it contained the case histories of those men who had been\nattacked by the strange malady.\n \n  Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient had\nreceived the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but while\nsleeping or lounging in the barracks.\n \n  Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp that\nled to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a low\nrectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.\n \n  Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In those\nbunks some thirty men lay sleeping.\n \n  The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stood\nthere, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walk\ntoward that window.\n \n  \"Look here,\" he said.\n \n  Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dull\nmetal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The central\npart of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and as\nI seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.\n \n  All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-red\nrays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens to\nconcentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockwork\nserved a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lens\nslowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.\n \n  I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.\nBack in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:\n \n  \"Turn it on!\"\n \n  The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.\nI stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, nor\nwas Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at the\ncontrols was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice.\nEzra Karn jabbed my elbow. \"Grannie's coming back. I thought she'd be\ngetting sick of this blamed moon.\"\n \n  It didn't make sense. In all the years I'd known Annabella C. Flowers,\nnever yet had I seen her desert a case until she had woven the clues\nand facts to a logical conclusion.\n \n  \"Ezra,\" I said, \"we're going to drive out and meet them. There's\nsomething screwy here.\"\n \n  Ten minutes later in another kite car we were driving at a fast clip\nthrough the powdery sands of the Baldric. And before long we saw\nanother car approaching.\n \n  It was Grannie. As the car drew up alongside I saw her sitting in her\nprim way next to Antlers Park. Park said:\n \n  \"We left the others at the mine. Miss Flowers is going back with me to\nmy offices to help me improve the formula for that new antitoxin.\"\n \n  He waved his hand, and the car moved off. I watched it as it sped\nacross the desert, and a growing suspicion began to form in my mind.\nThen, like a knife thrust, the truth struck me.\n \n  \"Ezra!\" I yelled, swinging the car. \"That wasn't Grannie!\nThat was one\nof those damned cockatoo images.\nWe've got to catch him.\"\n \n  The other car was some distance ahead now. Park looked back and saw us\nfollowing. He did something to the kite wire, and his car leaped ahead.\n \n  I threw the speed indicator hard over. Our kite was a huge box affair\nwith a steady powerful pull to the connecting wire. Park's vehicle\nwas drawn by a flat triangular kite that dove and fluttered with each\nvariance of the wind. Steadily we began to close in.\n \n  The manager of Interstellar Voice turned again, and something glinted\nin his hand. There was a flash of purple flame, and a round hole\nappeared in our windscreen inches above Karn's head.\n \n  \"Heat gun!\" Ezra yelled.\n \n  Now we were rocketing over the sand dunes, winding in and out between\nthe flagpole trees. I had to catch that car I told myself. Grannie\nAnnie's very life might be at stake, not to mention the lives of\nhundreds of mine workers. Again Park took aim and again a hole\nshattered our windscreen.\n \n  The wind shifted and blew from another quarter. The box kite soared,\nbut the triangular kite faltered. Taking advantage of Park's loss of\nspeed, I raced alongside.\n \n  The I. V. manager lifted his weapon frantically. But before he could\nuse it a third time, Ezra Karn had whipped a lariat from his belt and\nsent it coiling across the intervening space.\n \n  The thong yanked tight about the manager's throat. Park did the only\nthing he could do. He shut off power, and the two cars coasted to a\nhalt. Then I was across in the other seat, wrenching the weapon free\nfrom his grasp.\n \n  \"What have you done with Miss Flowers?\" I demanded.\n \n  The manager's eyes glittered with fear as he saw my finger tense on the\ntrigger. Weakly he lifted an arm and pointed to the northwest.\n \n  \"Val-ley. Thir-ty miles. Entrance hidden by wall of ... flagpole trees.\"\nI leaped into the driver's seat and gave the kite its head. And now the\ncountry began to undergo a subtle change. The trees seemed to group\nthemselves in a long flanking corridor in a northwesterly direction, as\nif to hide some secret that lay beyond. Twice I attempted to penetrate\nthat wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths.\n \n  Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert began\nagain. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard as\ngranite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distance\nblack bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm or\ndoorway between.\n \n  I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off power\nwith an exclamation of astonishment.\n \n  There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it was\nGrannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing.\n \n  \"Grannie!\" I yelled. \"What're you doing here? Where's Mr. Baker?\"\n \n  She rose to her feet and clambered down the rock.\n \n  \"Getting back Jimmy's mine laborers,\" she said, a twinkle in her eyes.\n\"I see you've got Antlers Park. I'm glad of that. It saves me a lot of\ntrouble.\" She took off her spectacles and wiped them on her sleeve.\n\"Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy. Come along, and I'll show you.\"\n \n  She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deep\ngorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressing\nclose. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement.\n \n  Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line of\nLarynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving down\nthe center of the gorge toward the entrance.\n \n  But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreen\nhad been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-like\ncontrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft of\nbluish radiance spewed from its open end. Playing it back and forth\nupon the marching men were Jimmy Baker and Xartal, the Martian.\n \n  \"Ultra violet,\" Grannie Annie explained. \"The opposite end of the\nvibratory scale and the only thing that will combat the infra-red rays\nthat cause red spot fever. Those men won't stop walking until they've\nreached Shaft Four.\"\n \n  Grannie Annie told her story during the long ride back to Shaft Four.\nWe drove slowly, keeping the line of marching Larynx miners always\nahead of us.\n \n  Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix, a lode which if\nworked successfully would see\nLarynx Incorporated\nbecome a far more\npowerful exporting concern than\nInterstellar Voice\n. Antlers Park\ndidn't want that.\n \n  It was he or his agents who placed those lens buttons in the Larynx\nbarracks.\nFor he knew that just as Jupiter's great spot was\nresponsible for a climate and atmosphere suitable for an Earthman on\nthis Eighth Moon, so also was that spot a deadly power in itself,\ncapable when its rays were concentrated of causing a fatal sickness.\nThen suddenly becoming fearful of Grannie's prying, Antlers Park strove\nto head her off before she reached Shaft Four.\n \n  He did head her off and managed to lure her and Baker and Xartal into\nthe Shaft barracks where they would be exposed to the rays from the\nlens button. But Grannie only pretended to contract the plague.\n \n  Park then attempted to outwit Ezra Karn and me by returning in Jimmy\nBaker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie.\nI listened to all this in silence. \"But,\" I said when she had finished,\n\"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine\nlaborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?\"\n \n  Grannie Annie frowned. \"I'm not sure I can answer the first of those\nquestions,\" she replied. \"You must remember Antlers Park has been on\nthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted\nhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n \n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens\nbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master\ncontrolling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners\nwere in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would\nbe susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you\ncoming with me?\"\n \n  \"Coming with you?\" I repeated. \"Where?\"\n \n  The old lady lit a cigarette. \"Pluto maybe,\" she said. \"There's a penal\ncolony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new\ncrime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,\nfugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....\"\n \n  \"Grannie,\" I laughed. \"You're incorrigible!\"\n", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "3a1cd1040dfb403caeeea2fc1f29370d", "response_text": "The mining for a precious ore called Acoustix has spurred colonization of Jupiter’s eighth moon by two mining companies called Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. There is a barren desert landscape between the mining areas of the two companies that is called the Baldric. The only plant appears to be trees that have melon-shaped tops, and the only animal is a silver parrot-like bird that is capable of imitating human speech, and also of imitating human forms in a holographic-like manner.\n\nGrannie Annie (AKA Annabella C. Flowers) is a famous science fiction writer, who is travelling to the Baldric with her martian employee, Xartal, who takes detailed drawings that are the background research for her next novel. She is travelling in a party of four: herself, Xartal, Ezra Karn (old prospector), and the narrator (called Billy-boy by Grannie).\n\nStrange happenings are known to occur in the Baldric. They encounter a silver bird that repeats English words and creates what seems like a mirage of themselves projected in the distance which disappears as it comes closer.

They travel to Larynx Incorporated’s offices with Jimmy, where he learns all of the workers from Shaft Four have left their posts due to the fever. Coincidentally, that is also their most productive ore location. Jimmy, Grannie, and Xartal take off to Shaft Four via the Baldric to investigate what is going on. During their travel, they break for camp near a flock of the birds and discover their ability to imitate human forms.\n\nAntlers Karn, the manager of Interstellar Voice, turns out to be a bad guy who ambushes Grannie’s camp.

Flowers, a science fiction author, known by her friends as Grannie Annie.

The moon was known for Acoustix, an ore that allows aging Martians to improve their supersonic telecommunication abilities. They traveled through the desert to an area called the Baldric, which was filled with cat-tail-like trees and silver cockatoo-like creatures. Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice (an Acoustix mining company) had told them about the area. As they continued on, the group had a shock: they saw duplicates of themselves traveling toward them. It was not a simple mirage, as they could hear the others talking. Once they got close, however, the doubles disappeared. Shaking off the odd situation, the group continued, and eventually ran into Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, the competitors of Interstellar Voice. It seemed Jimmy needed Grannie's help: his workers at the mine had been falling sick with Red Spot Fever, which made them wander into the Baldric. The group headed to the Larynx Incorporated offices, where Jimmy admitted that calling off the mining expedition would mean the end of Jimmy's company, so he needed to combat the Fever. Grannie grabbed supplies from Jimmy's laboratory and they headed to the desert with Xartal. Ezra and Billy stayed to look around the offices, and briefly talked to Antlers Park on the visiphone. He had less issue with the Fever, but had an antitoxin that he was willing to share with Jimmy. Through a camera on Jimmy's car, Billy was able to watch the group in the desert as another set of mirages appeared. Grannie excitedly realized that the cockatoos on the moon were copying Xartal's drawings, mimicking the mental images and causing these \"mirages\". Ezra and Billy headed to Jimmy's office to investigate reports, realizing that everyone fell sick in the barracks, not while mining. They found a lens in the barracks that was pushing concentrated rays towards the workers, so they ran to the visiscreen room to find out where Grannie was. They were surprised to see Antlers Park was the only person in the car with Grannie, Jimmy and Xartal nowhere to be seen. Ezra and Billy drove out to meet them, where Billy realized this was a cockatoo and not the actual Grannie. Antlers Park eventually gave up the information about where he had left Grannie and the others, and when Billy and Ezra found them, Grannie showed them the blue ultraviolet light that had been set up to counteract the red rays that cause the fever. It seemed that the lens amplifying the rays to cause the fever was placed in Jimmy's company's barracks by Antlers' company, and the Red Spot Fever was a plan to keep Jimmy's company from becoming more successful than Antlers'.

On the moon, the team unites at the offices of Interstellar Voice, a company managed by Antlers Park. Upon Billy's arrival, Antlers updates him on the history of the company; Interstellar Voice and their rival company Larynx Incorporated mine the moon for its resource of an ore called Acoustix, which is popular amongst Martians because of its ability to revitalize their supersonic vocalizations that dwindle around middle age. Between the properties of these two companies stretches a vast desert known as the Baldric, which is home to a bird-like species resembling cockatoos as well as flagpole trees. Grannie Annie plans to cross in order to further observe the moon's environment and make way to Larynx Incorporated. Antlers Park warns them vaguely of danger in the Baldric, but the team leaves anyway. During the course of their journey, they observe the cockatoos and discover their ability to mimic human voices. In addition, they discover an alarming visage--from their perch atop a high cliff, they see four travelers, seemingly themselves in exact 3D duplicate, walking along the same path they'd just traversed. After this odd discovery, they meet Jimmy Baker, who arrives in his car guided through the air attached to a kite, and Grannie Annie reveals the true purpose of their trip is to help Jimmy resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. His workers have been stricken with Red-Spot Fever, which causes them to abandon their job and walk into the desert; Jimmy worries this will destroy his business.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n It was a fine day at the beach for Purnie's game—but his new friends played very rough!\n \n\n \n Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could run no more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the ocean at last.\n \n When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n \n \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\" He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder how tall the trees really were.\n \n His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be: the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant, its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and nimbi.\n \n With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie hurried toward the ocean.\n \n If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now, as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n \n He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this day just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and wouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n \n \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee—just wait and see!\" As he passed one of the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took care not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When Purnie had stopped time, the bees—like all the other creatures he met—had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as soon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.\n \n \n\n \n When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing. He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n \n He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends when they learned of his brave journey.\n \n The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n \n He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n \n He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth orange curls waiting to start that action.\n \n And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers of munching seaweed.\n \n \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time.\n \n \n\n \n \"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he expected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by activity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n \n He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped, not the world around him.\n \n He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the tripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n \n \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n \n The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its repast.\n \n Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n \n \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n \n \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are you going to do with them—mount them on the wall of your den back in San Diego?\"\n \n \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter. He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them, tagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n \n \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\"\n \n \n\n \n The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in their heels.\n \n \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's your money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just what I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety of the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n \n \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n \n \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little creatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n \n \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n \n As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson, will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position he got an upside down view of them walking away.\n \n He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway? What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n \n Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and went down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n \n \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the vicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n \n \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I believe.\"\n \n \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've discovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that flag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n \n \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively now!\"\n \n \n\n \n When the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n \n \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n \n \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will slide down on top of us.\"\n \n \"Well—that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be solid. It's got to stand at least—\"\n \n \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a flag.\"\n \n \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it sentiment if you will.\"\n \n \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n \n \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal? What I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n \n \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n \n \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man! It's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your space ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n \n \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n \n When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to himself, content to be in their company.\n \n He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see the remainder of the group running toward them.\n \n \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the scintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n \n \"How about that, Miles?\"\n \n \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\"\n \n \n\n \n Purnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box. Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\" He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful noises, and he felt most satisfied.\n \n \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little chuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n \n \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you suppose—\"\n \n By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he stood on one leg.\n \n \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n \n \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids—\"\n \n \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\n \n \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest—\"\n \n \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why, they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors flocking to me. How about it, Benson—does pioneering pay off or doesn't it?\"\n \n \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be great danger to the crew—\"\n \n \"Now look here! You had planned to put mineral specimens in a lead box, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\"\n \n \"He'll die.\"\n \n \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and what's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n \n Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for, the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their own tricks.\n \n He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box. Purnie sat up to watch the show.\n \n \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no intention of running away.\"\n \n \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n \n \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n \n \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n \n \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\"\n \n \n\n \n Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he wiggled in anticipation.\n \n He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered. Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to protect himself.\n \n He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n \n \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back into the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n \n The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that, and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box. He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n \n \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n \n \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's all. Now pick him up.\"\n \n The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion. What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had ordered the stoppage of time.\n \n The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to understand.\n \n As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed, he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head. He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a hissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing. Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its three legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n \n Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll, torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach animals.\n \n Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he didn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already abused this faculty.\n \n \n\n \n When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand—on the spot where Purnie had been standing.\n \n \"My God, he's—he's gone.\"\n \n Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\n\"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What did you do with him?\"\n \n The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around in front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n \n \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n \n \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n \n \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n \n \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that you've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n \n \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that gun!\"\n \n Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide. Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below filled him with hysteria.\n \n The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf. Others were pinned down on the sand.\n \n \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching his ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me? Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off, tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it about.\n \n The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\n \n \n\n \n Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves. The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of death.\n \n \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n \n \"I—I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to drown!\"\n \n \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n \n \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us here in the water—\"\n \n \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's—\" His sounds were cut off by a wavelet gently rolling over his head.\n \n Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding the consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n \n Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry—at least, not as far as his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid, where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n \n It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n \n Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there. He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock. Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the chaotic scene before him.\n \n At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from him.\n \n He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness, he knew he must first resume time.\n \n Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n \n Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered time to resume, nothing happened.\n \n His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he wanted to see them safe.\n \n He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no urging time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces, first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He had to take one viewpoint or the other.\n \n Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took command....\n \n \n\n \n His friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach and pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over Purnie as sounds came from the animal.\n \n \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick! What's happening?\"\n \n \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man—I saw it, too. We're either crazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n \n \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles, we're both cracking.\"\n \n \"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are. I was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're piled up over there!\"\n \n \"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain Benson!\"\n \n \"Are you men all right?\"\n \n \"Yes sir, but—\"\n \n \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n \n \"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs—\"\n \n \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the others and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n \n \"But what happened, Captain?\"\n \n \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old they're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would take super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n \n \"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so busy eating seaweed—\"\n \n \"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't walk. Where's Forbes?\"\n \n \"He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or laughing. I can't tell which.\"\n \n \"We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all right?\"\n \n \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll do anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\n \n \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along shortly.\"\n \n \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this. Hee-hee!\"\n \n \n\n \n Purnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n \n He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks, where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n \n \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n \n \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n \n \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n \n \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\n \n \"I still can't believe it.\"\n \n \"He'll never be the same.\"\n \n \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back there?\"\n \n \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us suddenly—\"\n \n \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\n \n \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\n \n \"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\n \n \"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I—I guess I was thinking mostly of myself.\"\n \n \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him too.\"\n \n \"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.\"\n \n \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got him in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil come back to his tormentors—back to us—when we were trapped under those logs?\"\n \n \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn't do him any more harm.... I'm sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I'm still a little shaky.\"\n \n \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off. I'll join you in a few minutes. I think I'll go back and look around. You know. Make sure we haven't left anyone.\"\n \n \"No need to do that. They're all ahead of us. I've checked.\"\n \n \"That's my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\"\n \n \n\n \n As Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through glazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was nearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now had become familiar.\n \n \"Where are you?\"\n \n Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was beyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he returned.\n \n \"We've made a terrible mistake. We—\" The sounds faded in and out on Purnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered logs and peer around and under them.\n \n \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of the others.\n \n Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "854530e8f8534a138e1789433cc58ac3", "response_text": "Purnie, an animal, is going to see the ocean on his fifth birthday. He has heard stories about this place, and experiencing it firsthand is surreal for him. Purnie is careful not to disturb the animals he sees along the way because he has frozen time, and everything must resume normally when he unfreezes it. He knows that time-stopping is forbidden for animals his age, but he chooses to believe that his family will be proud of his bravery. \n\nFinally, he sees the ocean in front of him, and he resumes time. He does a head-stand and feels weak and dizzy. These feelings are a result of the time-stop, and he knows it. Purnie approaches some humans on the beach. A man named Forbes is in the middle of explaining to his captain, Benson, that he has found 17 planets to claim as his own. Forbes is hellbent on raising his FORBES flag as soon as possible. He is eager to stake his claim to the land and says that his mission is much bigger than real estate alone. Benson retorts that yes, his mission is bigger than just real estate because his paperwork says that Forbes will own all of the inhabitants of the planets he claims as well as the land. \n\nThe crew members use a special machine and  find radiation emanating from Purnie. Forbes demands that they put the animal in a box. Benson protests and reminds Forbes that it’s against Universal Law, but Forbes insists. Purnie experiences his first-ever impulse to run away with fear when a noose comes towards him. He goes back to pick up his fruit, and Forbes shoots him in the leg. When the man throws the noose again, Purnie involuntarily stops time. He drags himself up the knoll where he originally came from. \n\nThe humans are astonished when time resumes and Purnie is not where he was a split second ago. They spot him up on top of a pile of petrified logs, and suddenly the logs fall down the hill and pin the men down. Purnie is shocked and regretful. The whole thing was an accident. He deliberately stops time and uses all of his remaining strength to lift the logs off of the humans. Purnie begins to lose consciousness, and he knows that he must resume time or he will die. After pouring all of his strength into this action, time does begin again. The humans resume life and feel as though they have gone mad. They know that they were just facing death by drowning, and now they are free. The logs were so heavy that it would have taken superhuman strength to move them. Forbes, in particular, has really gone mad, and he laughs to himself uncontrollably. Benson believes that Purnie was responsible for moving the logs, but of course that seems physically impossible. \n \nPurnie stares off at the beautiful ocean views and watches the men leave in their vehicle as he dies. \n"}, {"worker_id": "8", "uid": "402b2fdd91eb4c30ab476be31fe34319", "response_text": "On his fifth birthday, Purnie--a small, kangaroo-like creature with large eyes--runs through the forest as he goes to see the beach for the first time. Bemoaning the fact that days are so short, he triggers his ability to stop time. He marvels at the bees frozen in mid-air and reminds himself to not abuse his time-stopping power or it could drain all of his energy and kill him. Before arriving at the beach, he gathers some fruit for lunch and then pauses atop a small, rocky hill from where he takes in his first view of the ocean. Purnie is overwhelmed and thrilled at the idea of making friends with the new animals he sees: three-legged tripons, a flock of spora, and, further down, a group of ten humans making their way onto the beach. When he unfreezes time, Purnie climbs down the rockpile and runs around the beach, showing his new animal friends his headstand technique. Next, he visits two humans, who barely notice his presence. Captain Benson is the hired leader of the expedition; Forbes is a wealthy real estate investor who owns seventeen planets and considers himself a \"pioneer\". Forbes explains to Benson that coming to the planet is a mere formality as he has already staked his claim to make this planet his eighteenth; planting a flag emblazoned with his name is a symbolic gesture. Benson's men wish to explore the new planet and its native species, but Forbes is impatient to build his flagpole and leave. He has no interest in learning about the creatures there, only in owning their land and tripling his investment over time. Purnie wants to play with the humans, and Forbes expresses his annoyance and tries to get a crewmember to take him away. One of the crew members, Miles, checks the planet's surface for radiation while Benson and Forbes investigate the rockpile where Purnie had perched earlier to see if the rocks may be used to support Forbes' flagpole. After they determine the rocks are extremely heavy petrified logs and cannot be moved, Miles alerts them that Purnie is emitting a large amount of radiation. Forbes orders the crew to capture Purnie so he can take him home, reproduce him, and profit off of his radiation resource. As Purnie evades capture, thinking he is playing with the men, Forbes grows impatient and shoots him, causing Purnie to instinctively stop time. Injured, Purnie takes shelter atop the petrified logs, which fall under him and crush the humans below. Panicked, Purnie rushes to remove the logs, using up his own energy. When he unfreezes time again, the men are astonished. In one moment, they were crushed by logs, and in the next, the logs had disappeared. This drives Forbes insane, and he laughs as they take him away to the ship.

When he reaches the shore, he recognizes the petrified logs, spora, and tripons from his brothers’ descriptions and is delighted to find two-legged animals there as well. Purnie approaches the two-legged animals who are actually humans and speaks to them but is ignored. The humans discuss the men who are curiously looking at the animals around them, and Forbes, the leader, orders Captain Benson to have the men work right away. Purnie follows the men closely, and Forbes gets annoyed and kicks at him. They talk about this being Forbes's eighteenth planet, and Forbes wants his flag planted and a cornerstone and plaque installed. One of the men gets a strong reading on his scintillometer, a device that detects radiation. Tracing the reading, they find it is coming from Purnie. Forbes orders Purnie put into a lead box, thinking radioactive animals can reproduce and provide an endless supply of radioactive materials. Benson is reluctant because putting Purnie in the box will kill him, and it goes against Universal Law. Forbes reminds him of their contract, and Benson has his men try to rope Purnie, who thinks it is a game and playfully comes near the box before running away. When Forbes loses patience, he shoots at Purnie to wound him. Stunned, he stops and sees the noose coming toward him. Purnie freezes time again, limps away, and climbs to the top of the bluff. When he restarts time, the men are shocked he is no longer there on the beach with them. Spying Purnie on the bluff, they approach him; Purnie shifts, causing the logs to slide down and hit the men. Purnie is shocked and saddened at their suffering and feels awful he caused it. He realizes some of the men will drown because they can’t move and the tide is coming in, so he freezes time again, pulls the logs off the men, and drags them onto the beach. At the top of the hill, he restarts time, and the men are puzzled to be back on the beach with the logs off them. They question their sanity, and Forbes really has gone insane. The men help those who are seriously wounded, disarm Forbes and tie his hands together, and return him to the ship. Benson wonders why Purnie would come back to the humans who tormented him and goes back to the beach looking for him.

It tires Purnie to use time-stopping, and if done too much it can kill the user.\n\nPurnie leaves brothers and parents in a village in the forest and stops time while venturing beside a stream towards the ocean.

When the crew discovers that Purnie is radioactive, Forbes orders them to capture it and place it in a lead box to bring to Earth, which Forbes thinks will make him very rich. Purnie’s confusion about their hostility leads to an involuntary stopping of time which is used to return to the top of the cliff. Accidentally, Purnie sets off a rock slide after restarting time from the location on the top of the cliff and sets off a rock slide while peering over the edge that traps most of the humans under rocks and petrified logs along the beach and in the ocean. Deep horror causes Pernie to once again stop time, go down to the beach, and move all the debris off the humans - saving their lives.\n\nWhen time restarts once again, the humans are completely baffled as to how they were rescued, and Forbes loses his grip on reality entirely - having to be tied up by the crew for their return trip. Captain Benson wonders why a creature they tried to capture and kill would have come back to their rescue from their almost certain deaths and goes looking for Pernie as the crew prepares to leave.

When Forbes demands that Benson’s crew stop dawdling and hurry up and put his FORBES flag up, Benson tells Forbes that they are only humans. Of course they are interested in the new environment and want to take a moment to look around. He is not afraid to tell Forbes that capturing Purnie or injuring him is against Universal Laws. Benson does not want to take part in illegal activities, and he scoffs at Forbes’ remarks that he is a pioneer and not a real estate developer.

Benson also questions Forbes's right to claim all the planets he is claiming and pokes a little fun at him at times. When Forbes wants Benson to order his men right to work after they arrive, Benson counters by asking if Forbes is human since they’ve only been there twenty minutes, and the men are curious about the new planet. Benson also needles Forbes when the men discover radiation, pointing out that he will make enough money to buy his next planet. Forbes is unimpressed with the discovery of radiation since they’ve found some on each of his other planets so far, but not in significant quantities. Forbes is most concerned about staking his claim by installing his flag, a cornerstone, and a plaque. When Benson questions the importance of the flag, Forbes tells him it signifies an empire, development, and progress.

Why didn't he hire somebody else?\"\n \n \n\n \n Mia looked at his companion. He spat. \"What hurts most, he pays us for it. I could buy half this planet, and he makes me his guide—at less than I pay my secretary.\"\n \n \"Well, anyway, we won't have to cross that ridge.\"\n \n \"Hey, you!\" Extrone called.\n \n The two of them turned immediately.\n \n \"You two scout ahead,\" Extrone said. \"See if you can pick up some tracks.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said, and instantly the two of them readjusted their shoulder straps and started off.\n \n Shortly they were inside of the scrub forest, safe from sight. \"Let's wait here,\" Mia said.\n \n \"No, we better go on. He may have sent a spy in.\"\n \n They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were not professional guides.\n \n \"We don't want to get too near,\" Ri said after toiling through the forest for many minutes. \"Without guns, we don't want to get near enough for the farn beast to charge us.\"\n \n They stopped. The forest was dense, the vines clinging.\n \n \"He'll want the bearers to hack a path for him,\" Mia said. \"But we go it alone. Damn him.\"\n \n Ri twisted his mouth into a sour frown. He wiped at his forehead. \"Hot. By God, it's hot. I didn't think it was this hot, the first time we were here.\"\n \n Mia said, \"The first time, we weren't guides. We didn't notice it so much then.\"\n \n They fought a few yards more into the forest.\n \n Then it ended. Or, rather, there was a wide gap. Before them lay a blast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, but the tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath.\n \n \"This isn't ours!\" Ri said. \"This looks like it was made nearly a year ago!\"\n \n Mia's eyes narrowed. \"The military from Xnile?\"\n \n \"No,\" Ri said. \"They don't have any rockets this small. And I don't think there's another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one we leased from the Club. Except the one he brought.\"\n \n \"The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place?\" Mia asked. \"You think it's their blast?\"\n \n \"So?\" Ri said. \"But who are they?\"\n \n \n\n \n It was Mia's turn to shrug. \"Whoever they were, they couldn't have been hunters. They'd have kept the secret better.\"\n \n \"We didn't do so damned well.\"\n \n \"We didn't have a chance,\" Mia objected. \"Everybody and his brother had heard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn't our fault Extrone found out.\"\n \n \"I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead of us.\"\n \n Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"We should have shot our pilot, too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who told Extrone we'd hunted this area.\"\n \n \"I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.\"\n \n \"After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going to the alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.\"\n \n There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip.\n \n \" I didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking,\" Mia said.\n \n Ri's mouth twisted. \"I didn't say you did.\"\n \n \"Listen,\" Mia said in a hoarse whisper. \"I just thought. Listen. To hell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us, too, when the hunt's over.\"\n \n Ri licked his lips. \"No. He wouldn't do that. We're not—not just anybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even him . And besides, why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Too many people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.\"\n \n Mia said, \"I hope you're right.\" They stood side by side, studying the blast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, \"We better be getting back.\"\n \n \"What'll we tell him?\"\n \n \"That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?\"\n \n They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.\n \n \"It gets hotter at sunset,\" Ri said nervously.\n \n \"The breeze dies down.\"\n \n \"It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. There must be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.\"\n \n \"There may be a pass,\" Mia said, pushing a vine away.\n \n Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. \"I guess that's it. If there were a lot of them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it's damned funny, when you think about it.\"\n \n Mia looked up at the darkening sky. \"We better hurry,\" he said.\n \n \n\n \n When it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low, obviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the outpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the blazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over Extrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled into the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its blasts.\n \n Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat disgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.\n \n Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking officers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce, the officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and knees almost stiff.\n \n \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked.\n \n They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began.\n \n \"Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone demanded, ominously not raising his voice.\n \n \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it's another alien ship. It was sighted a few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.\"\n \n Extrone's face looked much too innocent. \"How did it get there, gentlemen? Why wasn't it destroyed?\"\n \n \"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.\"\n \n \"So?\" Extrone mocked.\n \n \"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could locate and destroy it.\"\n \n Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned away, in the direction of a resting bearer. \"You!\" he said. \"Hey! Bring me a drink!\" He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. \"I'm staying here.\"\n \n The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. \"But, sir....\"\n \n Extrone toyed with his beard. \"About a year ago, gentlemen, there was an alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it, didn't you?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.\"\n \n \"You'll destroy this one, too,\" Extrone said.\n \n \"We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through. But it might try a long range bombardment, sir.\"\n \n \n\n \n Extrone said, \"To begin with, they probably don't even know I'm here. And they probably couldn't hit this area if they did know. And you can't afford to let them get a shot at me, anyway.\"\n \n \"That's why we'd like you to return to an inner planet, sir.\"\n \n Extrone plucked at his right ear lobe, half closing his eyes. \"You'll lose a fleet before you'll dare let anything happen to me, gentlemen. I'm quite safe here, I think.\"\n \n The bearer brought Extrone his drink.\n \n \"Get off,\" Extrone said quietly to the four officers.\n \n Again they turned reluctantly. This time, he did not call them back. Instead, with amusement, he watched until they disappeared into the tangle of forest.\n \n Dusk was falling. The takeoff blast of the rocket illuminated the area, casting weird shadows on the gently swaying grasses; there was a hot breath of dry air and the rocket dwindled toward the stars.\n \n Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed the empty glass away, listened for it to shatter. He reached out, parted the heavy flap to his tent.\n \n \"Sir?\" Ri said, hurrying toward him in the gathering darkness.\n \n \"Eh?\" Extrone said, turning, startled. \"Oh, you. Well?\"\n \n \"We ... located signs of the farn beast, sir. To the east.\"\n \n Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, \"You killed one, I believe, on your trip?\"\n \n Ri shifted. \"Yes, sir.\"\n \n Extrone held back the flap of the tent. \"Won't you come in?\" he asked without any politeness whatever.\n \n Ri obeyed the order.\n \n The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky feathers, costly of transport space, the sleep curtains of silken gauze. The floor, heavy, portable tile blocks, not the hollow kind, were neatly and smoothly inset into the ground. Hanging from the center, to the left of the slender, hand-carved center pole, was a chain of crystals. They tinkled lightly when Extrone dropped the flap. The light was electric from a portable dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He crossed to the bed, sat down.\n \n \"You were, I believe, the first ever to kill a farn beast?\" he said.\n \n \"I.... No, sir. There must have been previous hunters, sir.\"\n \n \n\n \n Extrone narrowed his eyes. \"I see by your eyes that you are envious—that is the word, isn't it?—of my tent.\"\n \n Ri looked away from his face.\n \n \"Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I have never killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't seen a farn beast.\"\n \n Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone's glittering ones. \"Few people have seen them, sir.\"\n \n \"Oh?\" Extrone questioned mildly. \"I wouldn't say that. I understand that the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of their planets.\"\n \n \"I meant in our system, sir.\"\n \n \"Of course you did,\" Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of his sleeve with his forefinger. \"I imagine these are the only farn beasts in our system.\"\n \n Ri waited uneasily, not answering.\n \n \"Yes,\" Extrone said, \"I imagine they are. It would have been a shame if you had killed the last one. Don't you think so?\"\n \n Ri's hands worried the sides of his outer garment. \"Yes, sir. It would have been.\"\n \n Extrone pursed his lips. \"It wouldn't have been very considerate of you to—But, still, you gained valuable experience. I'm glad you agreed to come along as my guide.\"\n \n \"It was an honor, sir.\"\n \n Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. \"If I had waited until it was safe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able to find such an illustrious guide.\"\n \n \"... I'm flattered, sir.\"\n \n \"Of course,\" Extrone said. \"But you should have spoken to me about it, when you discovered the farn beast in our own system.\"\n \n \"I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity, sir....\"\n \n \"Of course,\" Extrone said dryly. \"Like all of my subjects,\" he waved his hand in a broad gesture, \"the highest as well as the lowest slave, know me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.\"\n \n Ri squirmed, his face pale. \"We do indeed love you, sir.\"\n \n Extrone bent forward. \" Know me and love me.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. Know you and love you, sir,\" Ri said.\n \n \"Get out!\" Extrone said.\n \n \n\n \n \"It's frightening,\" Ri said, \"to be that close to him.\"\n \n Mia nodded.\n \n The two of them, beneath the leaf-swollen branches of the gnarled tree, were seated on their sleeping bags. The moon was clear and cold and bright in a cloudless sky; a small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for a central mountain ridge that bisected it into almost twin hemispheres.\n \n \"To think of him. As flesh and blood. Not like the—well; that—what we've read about.\"\n \n Mia glanced suspiciously around him at the shadows. \"You begin to understand a lot of things, after seeing him.\"\n \n Ri picked nervously at the cover of his sleeping bag.\n \n \"It makes you think,\" Mia added. He twitched. \"I'm afraid. I'm afraid he'll.... Listen, we'll talk. When we get back to civilization. You, me, the bearers. About him. He can't let that happen. He'll kill us first.\"\n \n Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. \"No. We have friends. We have influence. He couldn't just like that—\"\n \n \"He could say it was an accident.\"\n \n \"No,\" Ri said stubbornly.\n \n \"He can say anything,\" Mia insisted. \"He can make people believe anything. Whatever he says. There's no way to check on it.\"\n \n \"It's getting cold,\" Ri said.\n \n \"Listen,\" Mia pleaded.\n \n \"No,\" Ri said. \"Even if we tried to tell them, they wouldn't listen. Everybody would know we were lying. Everything they've come to believe would tell them we were lying. Everything they've read, every picture they've seen. They wouldn't believe us. He knows that.\"\n \n \"Listen,\" Mia repeated intently. \"This is important. Right now he couldn't afford to let us talk. Not right now. Because the Army is not against him. Some officers were here, just before we came back. A bearer overheard them talking. They don't want to overthrow him!\"\n \n Ri's teeth, suddenly, were chattering.\n \n \"That's another lie,\" Mia continued. \"That he protects the people from the Army. That's a lie. I don't believe they were ever plotting against him. Not even at first. I think they helped him, don't you see?\"\n \n Ri whined nervously.\n \n \"It's like this,\" Mia said. \"I see it like this. The Army put him in power when the people were in rebellion against military rule.\"\n \n \n\n \n Ri swallowed. \"We couldn't make the people believe that.\"\n \n \"No?\" Mia challenged. \"Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow? You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the alien system!\"\n \n \"The people won't support them,\" Ri answered woodenly.\n \n \" Think. If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.\"\n \n Ri looked around at the shadows.\n \n \"That explains a lot of things,\" Mia said. \"I think the Army's been preparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's why Extrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them from learning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keep them from exposing him to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooled like we were, so easy.\"\n \n \"No!\" Ri snapped. \"It was to keep the natural economic balance.\"\n \n \"You know that's not right.\"\n \n Ri lay down on his bed roll. \"Don't talk about it. It's not good to talk like this. I don't even want to listen.\"\n \n \"When the invasion starts, he'll have to command all their loyalties. To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then. He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying to tell the truth.\"\n \n \"You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong.\"\n \n Mia smiled twistedly. \"How many has he already killed? How can we even guess?\"\n \n Ri swallowed sickly.\n \n \"Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?\"\n \n Ri shuddered. \"That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all like that.\"\n \n \n\n \n With morning came birds' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells. The air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike, uncontaminated.\n \n And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting the flap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared around the camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep.\n \n \"Breakfast!\" he shouted, and two bearers came running with a folding table and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray of various foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcher and a drinking mug.\n \n Extrone ate hugely, with none of the delicacy sometimes affected in his conversational gestures. When he had finished, he washed his mouth with water and spat on the ground.\n \n \"Lin!\" he said.\n \n His personal bearer came loping toward him.\n \n \"Have you read that manual I gave you?\"\n \n Lin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n \n Extrone pushed the table away. He smacked his lips wetly. \"Very ludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen for guides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me, twenty years ago, damn them.\"\n \n Lin waited.\n \n \"Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.\"\n \n \"The farn beasts are dangerous, sir,\" Lin said.\n \n \"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did the manual say about them?\"\n \n \"I believe they're carnivorous, sir.\"\n \n \"An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the only information on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual—and, of course, two businessmen.\"\n \n \"They have very long, sharp fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of tearing a man—\"\n \n \"An alien?\" Extrone corrected.\n \n \"There's not enough difference between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an alien to pieces, sir.\"\n \n Extrone laughed harshly. \"It's 'sir' whenever you contradict me?\"\n \n Lin's face remained impassive. \"I guess it seems that way. Sir.\"\n \n \"Damned few people would dare go as far as you do,\" Extrone said. \"But you're afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren't you?\"\n \n Lin shrugged. \"Maybe.\"\n \n \"I can see you are. Even my wives are. I wonder if anyone can know how wonderful it feels to have people all afraid of you.\"\n \n \"The farn beasts, according to the manual....\"\n \n \"You are very insistent on one subject.\"\n \n \"... It's the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as I was saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, of aliens. Sir.\"\n \n \"All right,\" Extrone said, annoyed. \"I'll be careful.\"\n \n In the distance, a farn beast coughed.\n \n Instantly alert, Extrone said, \"Get the bearers! Have some of them cut a path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get the hell over here!\"\n \n Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt.\n \n \n\n \n Four hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked leisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at the vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their sharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy breathing.\n \n Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank deeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made oppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air.\n \n Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen fought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks for farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the tree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near.\n \n Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a powerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained fire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a folding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered two-way communication set.\n \n Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny, arboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to Extrone's satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur.\n \n When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers slump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume, he sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted, reflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.\n \n \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.\n \n \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be important.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The bearer twiddled the dials.\n \n \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother me?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't you?\"\n \n \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right in the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\"\n \n \"I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!\" Extrone tore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back, find out what they want, first. I don't want to be bothered unless it's important.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \n Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and perspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands.\n \n Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining bearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes.\n\"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About a quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\"\n \n Extrone's eyes lit with passion.\n \n Lin's face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I think.\"\n \n \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward and look at the spoor.\"\n \n Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.\"\n \n Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood up.\n \n \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\" Lin said.\n \n \"One is enough in my camp.\"\n \n \n\n \n The two of them went forward, alone, into the forest. Extrone moved agilely through the tangle, following Lin closely. When they came to the tracks, heavily pressed into drying mud around a small watering hole, Extrone nodded his head in satisfaction.\n \n \"This way,\" Lin said, pointing, and once more the two of them started off.\n \n They went a good distance through the forest, Extrone becoming more alert with each additional foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with a restraining hand. \"They may be quite a way ahead. Hadn't we ought to bring up the column?\"\n \n The farn beast, somewhere beyond a ragged clump of bushes, coughed. Extrone clenched the blast rifle convulsively.\n \n The farn beast coughed again, more distant this time.\n \n \"They're moving away,\" Lin said.\n \n \"Damn!\" Extrone said.\n \n \"It's a good thing the wind's right, or they'd be coming back, and fast, too.\"\n \n \"Eh?\" Extrone said.\n \n \"They charge on scent, sight, or sound. I understand they will track down a man for as long as a day.\"\n \n \"Wait,\" Extrone said, combing his beard. \"Wait a minute.\"\n \n \"Yes?\"\n \n \"Look,\" Extrone said. \"If that's the case, why do we bother tracking them? Why not make them come to us?\"\n \n \"They're too unpredictable. It wouldn't be safe. I'd rather have surprise on our side.\"\n \n \"You don't seem to see what I mean,\" Extrone said. \" We won't be the—ah—the bait.\"\n \n \"Oh?\"\n \n \"Let's get back to the column.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Extrone wants to see you,\" Lin said.\n \n Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy.\n\"What's he want to see me for?\"\n \n \"I don't know,\" Lin said curtly.\n \n Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously at Lin's bare forearm. \"Look,\" he whispered. \"You know him. I have—a little money. If you were able to ... if he wants,\" Ri gulped, \"to do anything to me—I'd pay you, if you could....\"\n \n \"You better come along,\" Lin said, turning.\n \n Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound, ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where Extrone was seated, petting his rifle.\n \n Extrone nodded genially. \"The farn beast hunter, eh?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \n Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. \"Tell me what they look like,\" he said suddenly.\n \n \"Well, sir, they're ... uh....\"\n \n \"Pretty frightening?\"\n \n \"No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.\"\n \n \"But you weren't afraid of them, were you?\"\n \n \"No, sir. No, because....\"\n \n Extrone was smiling innocently. \"Good. I want you to do something for me.\"\n \n \"I ... I....\" Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye. Lin's face was impassive.\n \n \"Of course you will,\" Extrone said genially. \"Get me a rope, Lin. A good, long, strong rope.\"\n \n \"What are you going to do?\" Ri asked, terrified.\n \n \"Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as bait.\"\n \n \"No!\"\n \n \"Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream—you can scream, by the way?\"\n \n Ri swallowed.\n \n \"We could find a way to make you.\"\n \n There was perspiration trickling down Ri's forehead, a single drop, creeping toward his nose.\n \n \"You'll be safe,\" Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. \"I'll shoot the animal before it reaches you.\"\n \n Ri gulped for air. \"But ... if there should be more than one?\"\n \n Extrone shrugged.\n \n \"I—Look, sir. Listen to me.\" Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands were trembling. \"It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir. He killed a farn beast before I did, sir. And last night—last night, he—\"\n \n \"He what?\" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.\n \n Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. \"He said he ought to kill you, sir. That's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you. He's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident, sir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I wouldn't....\"\n \n Extrone said, \"Which one is he?\"\n \n \"That one. Right over there.\"\n \n \"The one with his back to me?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir.\"\n \n Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle and said, \"Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.\"\n \n Ri was greenish. \"You ... you....\"\n \n Extrone turned to Lin. \"Tie one end around his waist.\"\n \n \"Wait,\" Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. \"You don't want to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anything should happen to me.... Please, sir. Don't do it.\"\n \n \"Tie it,\" Extrone ordered.\n \n \"No, sir. Please. Oh, please don't, sir.\"\n \n \"Tie it,\" Extrone said inexorably.\n \n Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.\n \n \n\n \n They were at the watering hole—Extrone, Lin, two bearers, and Ri.\n \n Since the hole was drying, the left, partially exposed bank was steep toward the muddy water. Upon it was green, new grass, tender-tuffed, half mashed in places by heavy animal treads. It was there that they staked him out, tying the free end of the rope tightly around the base of a scaling tree.\n \n \"You will scream,\" Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed across the water hole. \"The farn beast will come from this direction, I imagine.\"\n \n Ri was almost slobbering in fear.\n \n \"Let me hear you scream,\" Extrone said.\n \n Ri moaned weakly.\n \n \"You'll have to do better than that.\" Extrone inclined his head toward a bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see.\n \n \n\n \n Ri screamed.\n \n \"See that you keep it up that way,\" Extrone said. \"That's the way I want you to sound.\" He turned toward Lin. \"We can climb this tree, I think.\"\n \n Slowly, aided by the bearers, the two men climbed the tree, bark peeling away from under their rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly.\n \n Once at the crotch, Extrone settled down, holding the rifle at alert. Lin moved to the left, out on the main branch, rested in a smaller crotch.\n \n Looking down, Extrone said, \"Scream!\" Then, to Lin, \"You feel the excitement? It's always in the air like this at a hunt.\"\n \n \"I feel it,\" Lin said.\n \n Extrone chuckled. \"You were with me on Meizque?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"That was something, that time.\" He ran his hand along the stock of the weapon.\n \n The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled Extrone's head. He slapped at it, angry. The forest was quiet, underlined by an occasional piping call, something like a whistle. Ri's screams were shrill, echoing away, shiveringly. Lin sat quiet, hunched.\n \n Extrone's eyes narrowed, and he began to pet the gun stock with quick, jerky movements. Lin licked his lips, keeping his eyes on Extrone's face. The sun seemed stuck in the sky, and the heat squeezed against them, sucking at their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away. Still, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed.\n \n \n\n \n A farn beast coughed, far in the matted forest.\n \n Extrone laughed nervously. \"He must have heard.\"\n \n \"We're lucky to rouse one so fast,\" Lin said.\n \n Extrone dug his boot cleats into the tree, braced himself. \"I like this.

Mia is more assertive and confident than Ri, and he strongly believes that Extrone is a puppet leader installed by the military to ensure the people will support future military action against the aliens. Ri, fearful and timid, does not want to believe Mia's conspiracies and espouses faith in Extrone. Mia further fears that Extrone will kill them once the hunt is over because he does not want them to reveal the location of the farn beasts. Ri's fear of Extrone takes over when Extrone wants to use him as bait to catch the farn beasts, and he throws Mia under the bus by claiming Mia has suggested assassinating Extrone. Extrone immediately kills Mia and uses Ri as bait anyway."}]}]}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!\n \n\n \n The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did the light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in the gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.\n \n Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the humans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and arrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior to anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was almost ordinary-looking.\n \n As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—they were merely amused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably hideous.\n \n Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a short man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though not death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.\n \n The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt he was, which was what mattered.\n \n \"Sorry, colleague,\" Gabe said lazily. \"All my fault. You must let me buy you a replacement.\" He gestured to the bartender. \"Another of the same for my fellow-man here.\"\n \n The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth hastily supplied by the management.\n \n \"You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,\" Gabe said, taking out his wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look at them. \"Here, have yourself a new suit on me.\" You could use one was implied.\n \n And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance, was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just set before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's handsome face.\n \n \n\n \n Suddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. \"Don't do that,\" the nondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed the glass from the little man's slackening grasp. \"You wouldn't want to go to jail because of him.\"\n \n The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces now ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to smash back, and now it was too late for that.\n \n Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. \"So, it's you again?\"\n \n The man in the gray suit smiled. \"Who else in any world would stand up for you?\"\n \n \"I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you around, of course,\" Gabriel added too quickly. \"You do come in useful at times, you know.\"\n \n \"So you don't mind having me around?\" The nondescript man smiled again.\n\"Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?\"\n \n Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. \"Come on, have a drink with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.\"\n \n \"I drank with you once too often,\" the nondescript man said. \"And things worked out fine, didn't they? For you.\" His eyes studied the other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were not pleased with what they saw. \"Watch yourself, colleague,\" he warned as he left. \"Soon you might not be worth the saving.\"\n \n \"Who was that, Gabe?\" the girl asked.\n \n He shrugged. \"I never saw him before in my life.\" Of course, knowing him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he happened to have been telling the truth.\n \n \n\n \n Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions, reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to the letter combination bodyguard , he went out into the street.\n \n If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have been nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real identification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for years.\n \n The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\" the driver asked.\n \n \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n \n \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n \n But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n \n \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was wanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n \n \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n \n The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the teleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit suicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n \n \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin smile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it happens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a thrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and which the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n \n \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the window. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the cab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ... anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n \n \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a commission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n \n \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n \n \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n \n \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n \n \n\n II\n \n It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no condition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n \n \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he shook his handsome head.\n \n \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly, referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held, and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n \n Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little town, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed on the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a short fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n \n To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment before the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n \n Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him speculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled—shock had sobered him a little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have thrown me back in.\"\n \n \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n \n The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall that he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n \n \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked, glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n \n \" Mrs. ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n \n \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said, looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope you'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming car flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too. Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n \n There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and beginning to slide downhill....\n \n Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\n \n \n\n \n There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before, which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket closer about her chilly body. \"Aren't you going to introduce your—your friend to me, Gabe?\"\n \n \"I don't know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he's no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\"\n \n \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification card from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks ago, and now he isn't ... anything.\"\n \n \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I'd like to give you some token of my—of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation held little gratitude.\n \n The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money, thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband,\n\"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the future! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"\n \n Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise—I'll be careful.\"\n \n \n\n \n When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night, the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification. Perhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn't care.\n \n Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of\n\"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly applied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as nature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator; otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.\n \n \n\n \n Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs. Which was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been big money in musical chairs as such.\n \n When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the law—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n \n The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible. But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was the trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n \n The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but, when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew everybody else far too well.\n \n The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in coming to such desolate, off-trail places—hoping that eventually disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed too logical for the man he was haunting.\n \n However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green creature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n \n \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n \n \n\n III\n \n The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays from the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile patterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine Gabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only weighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you two to come out to a place like this?\"\n \n \"I really think Gabriel must be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly to herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse. It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n \n \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable and it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n \n The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you are the same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n \n The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of them.\"\n \n \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people who go around changing their bodies like—like hats?\" Automatically she reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\n \n \n\n \n He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.\n \n \"But why do you do it? Why! Do you like it? Or is it because of Gabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was included in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you; is that it?\"\n \n \"Ask him.\"\n \n \"He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I didn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what we've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I think?\"\n \n There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it respond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not, she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so casually.\n \n \n\n \n It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her husband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat—of fur taken from some animal who had lived and died light-years away—more closely about herself. The thin young man began to cough again.\n \n Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk of the Moon and hurl itself upward—one of the interstellar ships embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of them would stay....\n \n \"If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then do you keep helping him?\"\n \n \"I am not helping him . And he knows that.\"\n \n \"You'll change again tonight, won't you?\" she babbled. \"You always change after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to identify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's something about you that doesn't change.\"\n \n \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice less impersonal, \"for your sake.\"\n \n She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an outsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect that he was even more closely involved than that.\n \n \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the subject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the risk of getting a bad one?\"\n \n \"This isn't a good body,\" he said. \"It's diseased. Sure, nobody's supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty of foliage.\"\n \n \"How—long will it last you?\"\n \n \"Four or five months, if I'm careful.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry, if that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be expensive—that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then it was tough on me too, wasn't it?\"\n \n \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why are you doing it?\" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should know him better than most.\n \n \"Ask your husband.\"\n \n The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate, snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name, and stirred it with his toe. \"I'd better call a cab—he might freeze to death.\"\n \n He signaled and a cab came.\n \n \"Tell him, when he comes to,\" he said to the girl as he and the driver lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, \"that I'm getting pretty tired of this.\" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.\n\"Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't, in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I'm afraid you cannot play.\"\n \n \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.\n \n \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\"\n \n \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz shrugged. \"I'll pay you twice the regular fee.\"\n \n The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This game is really clean.\"\n \n \"In a town like this?\"\n \n \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz' tendrils quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung with him.\n \n \"We do a lot of business here,\" he said unnecessarily, for the whole set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by no means poor when it came to worldly goods. \"Why don't you try another town where they're not so particular?\"\n \n The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game. He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration. And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him? Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original casing had?\n \n He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl, seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of information.\n \n \n\n \n The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they detached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it happens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good health.\"\n \n The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured aloud. \"A criminal then.\"\n \n The green one's face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive.\n \n \"Male?\"\n \n \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or biological impossibility, no one could tell.\n \n It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part—if it had ever been proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body, Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,\n\"Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.\"\n \n \"It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take such a risk.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"How much?\"\n \n \"Thirty thousand credits.\"\n \n \"Why, that's three times the usual rate!\"\n \n \"The other will pay five times the usual rate.\"\n \n \"Oh, all right,\" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.\n \n \n\n \n He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body; tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the pockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful student of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily, nor whom the police intended to capture easily.\n  This might be a lucky break for me after all , the new tenant thought, as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious rude health, was not a very comfortable fit. I can do a lot with a hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe I'll be able to get away with it.\n \n\n\n IV\n \n \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don't try to fool me! I know you too well. And I know you have that man's—the real Gabriel Lockard's—body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.\n \n Lockard—Lockard's body, at any rate—sat up and felt his unshaven chin. \"That what he tell you?\"\n \n \"No, he didn't tell me anything really—just suggested I ask you whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to see his body spoiled.\"\n \n \"It is a pretty good body, isn't it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved at having someone with whom to share his secret.\n \n \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking at him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you're coursing. Gabe, why don't you...?\"\n \n \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.\n\"You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be his wife then. That would be nice—a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little more than you deserve?\"\n \n \"I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,\" she said truthfully enough, for she hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. \"Of course I'd go with you,\" she went on, now knowing she lied, \"when you got your ... old body back.\"\n  Sure , she thought, I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and thrill-mills. Actually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only once, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go with him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash that experience from her mind or her body.\n \n \"You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?\" she went on. \"You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose, does he?\"\n \n \"I don't want to know!\" he spat. \"I wouldn't want it if I could get it back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he looked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.\n\"Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a hulk I had!\"\n \n \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she said incautiously. \"You must have had a body to match your character. Pity you could only change one.\"", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "3", "uid": "ad2acea196584f569f3432f52034def4", "response_text": "\nGabriel (Gabe) Lockard, an attractive man, is sitting in a bar with humans and extraterrestrials. He knocks over a man's drink while he talks to a girl. He offers to pay for a new suit, showing off his wealth. The other man reaches to throw his drink at Lockard but is stopped by a third man wearing a gray suit, who seems to know Lockard. This man warns Lockard to be careful, and when he leaves, Lockard tells the woman he's with that he's never seen him before, even though they talked as if they were acquaintances. The stranger visits a locker at a nearby airstation, puts most of his belongings inside, including all forms of identification, and sets the lock to the word \"bodyguard\". He climbs into a helicab, where he pressures the driver into taking him to a zarquil game. This man has been floating around without an identity, but operates as a flying dutchman, floating between zarquil games. Another day, Lockard crashes a helicar on a rainy fall night in a dark corner of a degrading city, and a fat stranger pulls him and his wife out of the helicar before it exploded. The man who saved them has the ID of Dominic Bianchi, a milgot dealer who seems to have disappeared in the past few weeks. Mrs. Lockard warns her husband to be more careful lest something happen to him. It seems the stranger's job is to rotate identities and protect Lockard. On yet another day, a thin stranger chases off a thief with his gun, and checks in on Mr. and Mrs. Lockard. Mrs. Lockard realizes that he is the same man who pulled them out of their aircar crash, and was the man wearing the gray suit at the bar. He has been changing bodies this whole time. She wants to know why, but the stranger suggests she ask Gabriel. She suspects they've been running from this stranger, and has started to be able to identify him, which the stranger is disappointed by as he explains it is not Gabriel he is helping. Because Gabriel is going to run-down cities, the bodies the stranger is getting are not well-vetted, and can't last too long. It turns out the stranger was the original Gabriel Lockard, the implication being that he's trying to protect his original body. As the stranger tries to swap bodies again, he finds that nobody wants the one he's in. He's offered a body that is healthy but likely a criminal, for three times the usual fee, and the stranger accepts the expensive deal. After the bodyswap, he recognizes the man as someone police are ordered to burn on sights. Mrs. Lockard interrogates her husband about his stolen body, which starts an argument. She recognizes he can't get his old body back, but lies and says she'd stay with him if he switched back, and the two talk about how ugly he was.

Trouble was—their friendship was as dangerous as their hate!\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n General Finogenov notified Major Winship that the underground blast was scheduled for the following morning.\n \n Major Winship, after receiving the message, discussed precautions with the three other Americans.\n \n Next morning, before the sunlight exploded, the four of them donned their space suits and went and sat outside the dome, waiting. The sun rose with its bright, silent clap of radiance. Black pools of shadows lay in harsh contrast, their edges drawn with geometric precision.\n \n Major Winship attempted unsuccessfully to communicate with Base Gagarin. \"Will you please request the general to keep us informed on the progress of the countdown?\"\n \n \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply. \"Help?\"\n \n \" Nyet ,\" said Major Winship, exhausting his Russian. \"Count down. Progress. When—boom?\"\n \n \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply.\n \n \"Boom! Boom!\" said Major Winship in exasperation.\n \n \"Boom!\" said Pinov happily.\n \n \"When?\"\n \n \"Boom—boom!\" said Pinov.\n \n \"Oh, nuts.\" Major Winship cut out the circuit. \"They've got Pinov on emergency watch this morning,\" he explained to the other Americans.\n\"The one that doesn't speak English.\"\n \n \"He's done it deliberately,\" said Capt. Wilkins, the eldest of the four Americans. \"How are we going to know when it's over?\"\n \n No one bothered to respond. They sat for a while in silence while the shadows evaporated. One by one they clicked on their cooling systems.\n \n Ultimately, Lt. Chandler said, \"This is a little ridiculous. I'm going to switch over to their channel. Rap if you want me.\" He sat transfixed for several minutes. \"Ah, it's all Russian. Jabbering away. I can't tell a thing that's going on.\"\n \n In the airless void of the moon, the blast itself would be silent. A moth's wing of dust would, perhaps, rise and settle beyond the horizon: no more.\n \n \"Static?\"\n \n \"Nope.\"\n \n \"We'll get static on these things.\"\n \n A small infinity seemed to pass very slowly.\n \n Major Winship shifted restlessly. \"My reefer's gone on the fritz.\" Perspiration was trickling down his face.\n \n \"Let's all go in,\" said the fourth American, Capt. Lawler. \"It's probably over by now.\"\n \n \"I'll try again,\" Major Winship said and switched to the emergency channel. \"Base Gagarin? Base Gagarin?\"\n \n \"Is Pinov. Help?\"\n \n \" Nyet. \"\n \n \"Pinov's still there,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"Tell him, 'Help',\" said Capt. Wilkins, \"so he'll get somebody we can talk to.\"\n \n \"I'll see them all in hell, first,\" Major Winship said.\n \n Five minutes later, the perspiration was rivers across his face. \"This is it,\" he said. \"I'm going in.\"\n \n \"Let's all—\"\n \n \"No. I've got to cool off.\"\n \n \"Hell, Charlie, I feel stupid sitting out here,\" Capt. Lawler said.\n\"The shot probably went off an hour ago.\"\n \n \"The static level hasn't gone up much, if at all.\"\n \n \"Maybe,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"it's buried too deep.\"\n \n \"Maybe so,\" Major Winship said. \"But we can't have the dome fall down around all our ears.\" He stood. \"Whew! You guys stay put.\"\n \n \n\n \n He crossed with the floating moon-motion to the airlock and entered, closing the door behind him. The darkness slowly filled with air, and the temperature inside the suit declined steadily. At the proper moment of pressure, the inner lock slid open and Major Winship stepped into the illuminated central area. His foot was lifted for the second step when the floor beneath him rose and fell gently, pitching him forward, off balance. He stumbled against the table and ended up seated beside the radio equipment. The ground moved again.\n \n \"Charlie! Charlie!\"\n \n \"I'm okay,\" Major Winship answered. \"Okay! Okay!\"\n \n \"It's—\"\n \n There was additional surface movement. The movement ceased.\n \n \"Hey, Les, how's it look?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\n \n \"Okay from this side. Charlie, you still okay?\"\n \n \"Okay,\" Major Winship said. \"We told them this might happen,\" he added bitterly.\n \n There was a wait during which everyone seemed to be holding their breath.\n \n \"I guess it's over,\" said Major Winship, getting to his feet. \"Wait a bit more, there may be an after-shock.\" He switched once again to the emergency channel.\n \n \"Is Pinov,\" came the supremely relaxed voice. \"Help?\"\n \n Major Winship whinnied in disgust. \" Nyet! \" he snarled. To the other Americans: \"Our comrades seem unconcerned.\"\n \n \"Tough.\"\n \n They began to get the static for the first time. It crackled and snapped in their speakers. They made sounds of disapproval at each other. For a minute or two, static blanked out the communications completely. It then abated to something in excess of normal.\n \n \"Well,\" Lt. Chandler commented, \"even though we didn't build this thing to withstand a moonquake, it seems to have stood up all right.\"\n \n \"I guess I was just—\" Major Winship began. \"Oh, hell! We're losing pressure. Where's the markers?\"\n \n \"By the lug cabinet.\"\n \n \"Got 'em,\" Major Winship said a moment later.\n \n He peeled back a marker and let it fall. Air currents whisked it away and plastered it against a riveted seam of the dome. It pulsed as though it were breathing and then it ruptured.\n \n Major Winship moved quickly to cut out the emergency air supply which had cut in automatically with the pressure drop. \"You guys wait. It's on your right side, midway up. I'll try to sheet it.\"\n \n He moved for the plastic sheeting.\n \n \"We've lost about three feet of calk out here,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"I can see more ripping loose. You're losing pressure fast at this rate.\"\n \n Major Winship pressed the sheeting over the leak. \"How's that?\"\n \n \"Not yet.\"\n \n \"I don't think I've got enough pressure left to hold it, now. It's sprung a little, and I can't get it to conform over the rivet heads.\"\n \n There was a splatter of static.\n \n \"Damn!\" Major Winship said, \"they should have made these things more flexible.\"\n \n \"Still coming out.\"\n \n \"Best I can do.\" Major Winship stepped back. The sheet began slowly to slide downward, then it fell away completely and lay limply on the floor.\n \n \"Come on in,\" he said dryly.\n \n \n\n \n With the four of them inside, it was somewhat cramped. Most of the five hundred square feet was filled with equipment. Electrical cables trailed loosely along the walls and were festooned from the ceiling, radiating from the connections to the outside solar cells. The living space was more restricted than in a submarine, with the bunks jutting out from the walls about six feet from the floor.\n \n Lt. Chandler mounted one of the bunks to give them more room. \"Well,\" he said wryly, \"it doesn't smell as bad now.\"\n \n \"Oops,\" said Major Winship. \"Just a second. They're coming in.\" He switched over to the emergency channel. It was General Finogenov.\n \n \"Major Winship! Hello! Hello, hello, hello. You A Okay?\"\n \n \"This is Major Winship.\"\n \n \"Oh! Excellent, very good. Any damage, Major?\"\n \n \"Little leak. You?\"\n \n \"Came through without damage.\" General Finogenov paused a moment. When no comment was forthcoming, he continued: \"Perhaps we built a bit more strongly, Major.\"\n \n \"You did this deliberately,\" Major Winship said testily.\n \n \"No, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Major Winship, please believe me. I very much regret this. Very much so. I am very distressed. Depressed. After repeatedly assuring you there was no danger of a quake—and then to have something like this happen. Oh, this is very embarrassing to me. Is there anything at all we can do?\"\n \n \"Just leave us alone, thank you,\" Major Winship said and cut off the communication.\n \n \"What'd they say?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\n \n \"Larry, General Finogenov said he was very embarrassed by this.\"\n \n \"That's nice,\" Lt. Chandler said.\n \n \"I'll be damned surprised,\" Major Winship said, \"if they got any seismic data out of that shot.... Well, to hell with them, let's get this leak fixed. Skip, can you get the calking compound?\"\n \n \"Larry, where's the inventory?\"\n \n \"Les has got it.\"\n \n Lt. Chandler got down from the bunk and Capt. Wilkins mounted.\n \n \"Larry,\" Major Winship said, \"why don't you get Earth?\"\n \n \"Okay.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins got down from the bunk and Capt. Lawler ascended.\n \n \"Got the inventory sheet, Les?\"\n \n \"Right here.\"\n \n Squeezed in front of the massive transmitter, Capt. Wilkins had energized the circuits. There was a puzzled look on his face. He leaned his helmet against the speaker and then shook his head sadly. \"We can't hear anything without any air.\"\n \n Major Winship looked at the microphone. \"Well, I'll just report and—\" He started to pick up the microphone and reconsidered. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"That's right, isn't it.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins flicked off the transmitter. \"Some days you don't mine at all,\" he said.\n \n \"Les, have you found it?\"\n \n \"It's around here somewhere. Supposed to be back here.\"\n \n \"Well, find it.\"\n \n Lt. Chandler began moving boxes. \"I saw it—\"\n \n \"Skip, help look.\"\n \n Capt. Lawler got down from the bunk and Major Winship mounted. \"We haven't got all day.\"\n \n A few minutes later, Lt. Chandler issued the triumphant cry. \"Here it is! Dozen tubes. Squeeze tubes. It's the new stuff.\"\n \n Major Winship got down and Capt. Wilkins got up.\n \n \"Marker showed it over here,\" Major Winship said, inching over to the wall. He traced the leak with a metallic finger.\n \n \"How does this stuff work?\" Capt. Lawler asked.\n \n They huddled over the instruction sheet.\n \n \"Let's see. Squeeze the tube until the diaphragm at the nozzle ruptures. Extrude paste into seam. Allow to harden one hour before service.\"\n \n Major Winship said dryly, \"Never mind. I notice it hardens on contact with air.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins lay back on the bunk and stared upward. He said, \"Now that makes a weird kind of sense, doesn't it?\"\n \n \"How do they possibly think—?\"\n \n \"Gentlemen! It doesn't make any difference,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"Some air must already have leaked into this one. It's hard as a rock. A gorilla couldn't extrude it.\"\n \n \"How're the other ones?\" asked Major Winship.\n \n Lt. Chandler turned and made a quick examination. \"Oh, they're all hard, too.\"\n \n \"Who was supposed to check?\" demanded Capt. Wilkins in exasperation.\n \n \"The only way you can check is to extrude it,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"and if it does extrude, you've ruined it.\"\n \n \"That's that,\" Major Winship said. \"There's nothing for it but to yell help.\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler took the land car to Base Gagarin. The Soviet base was situated some ten miles toward sunset at the bottom of a natural fold in the surface. The route was moderately direct to the tip of the gently rolling ridge. At that point, the best pathway angled left and made an S-shaped descent to the basin. It was a one-way trip of approximately thirty exhausting minutes.\n \n Major Winship, with his deficient reefer, remained behind. Capt. Wilkins stayed for company.\n \n \"I want a cigarette in the worst way,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n \"So do I, Larry. Shouldn't be more than a couple of hours. Unless something else goes wrong.\"\n \n \"As long as they'll loan us the calking compound,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n \"Yeah, yeah,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"Let's eat.\"\n \n \"You got any concentrate? I'm empty.\"\n \n \"I'll load you,\" Capt. Wilkins volunteered wearily.\n \n It was an awkward operation that took several minutes. Capt. Wilkins cursed twice during the operation. \"I'd hate to live in this thing for any period.\"\n \n \"I think these suits are one thing we've got over the Russians,\" Major Winship said. \"I don't see how they can manipulate those bulky pieces of junk around.\"\n \n They ate.\n \n \"Really horrible stuff.\"\n \n \"Nutritious.\"\n \n After the meal, Major Winship said reflectively, \"Now I'd like a cup of hot tea. I'm cooled off.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins raised eyebrows. \"What brought this on?\"\n \n \"I was just thinking.... They really got it made, Larry. They've got better than three thousand square feet in the main dome and better than twelve hundred square feet in each of the two little ones. And there's only seven of them right now. That's living.\"\n \n \"They've been here six years longer, after all.\"\n \n \"Finogenov had a clay samovar sent up. Lemon and nutmeg, too. Real, by God, fresh lemons for the tea, the last time I was there. His own office is about ten by ten. Think of that. One hundred square feet. And a wooden desk. A wooden desk. And a chair. A wooden chair. Everything big and heavy. Everything. Weight, hell. Fifty pounds more or less—\"\n \n \"They've got the power-plants for it.\"\n \n \"Do you think he did that deliberately?\" Major Winship asked. \"I think he's trying to force us off. I think he hoped for the quake. Gagarin's built to take it, I'll say that. Looks like it, anyhow. You don't suppose they planned this all along? Even if they didn't, they sure got the jump on us again, didn't they? I told you what he told me?\"\n \n \"You told me,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n \n\n \n After a moment, Major Winship said bitterly, \"To hell with the Russian engineer.\"\n \n \"If you've got all that power....\"\n \n \"That's the thing. That's the thing that gripes me, know what I mean? It's just insane to send up a heavy wooden desk. That's showing off. Like a little kid.\"\n \n \"Maybe they don't make aluminum desks.\"\n \n \"They've—got—aluminum. Half of everything on the whole planet is aluminum. You know they're just showing off.\"\n \n \"Let me wire you up,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"We ought to report.\"\n \n \"That's going to take awhile.\"\n \n \"It's something to do while we wait.\"\n \n \"I guess we ought to.\" Major Winship came down from the bunk and sat with his back toward the transmitter. Capt. Wilkins slewed the equipment around until the emergency jacks were accessible. He unearthed the appropriate cable and began unscrewing the exterior plate to the small transmitter-receiver set on Major Winship's back. Eventually, trailing wires, Major Winship was coupled into the network.\n\"Okay?\"\n \n \"Okay,\" Major Winship gestured.\n \n They roused Earth.\n \n \"This is Major Charles Winship, Commanding Officer, Freedom 19, the American moonbase.\"\n \n At this point, Major Winship observed for the first time that he was now on emergency air. He started to ask Capt. Wilkins to change his air bottle, but then he realized his communications were cut off. He reached over and rapped Capt. Wilkins' helmet.\n \n \"This is the Cape. Come in, Major Winship.\"\n \n \"Just a moment.\"\n \n \"Is everything all right?\"\n \n Major Winship was squirming nervously, obviously perturbed.\n \n \"A-Okay,\" he said. \"Just a moment.\"\n \n \"What's wrong?\" came the worried question. In the background, he heard someone say, \"I think there's something wrong.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins peered intently. Major Winship contorted his face in a savage grimace.\n \n Capt. Wilkins raised his eyebrows in alarm. They were face to face through their helmets, close together. Each face appeared monstrously large to the other.\n \n Major Winship made a strangling motion and reached for his throat. One arm tangled a cable and jerked the speaker jack loose. Major Winship could no longer hear the alarmed expressions from the Cape. The effort was not entirely subvocal, since he emitted a little gasping cry in involuntary realism.\n \n This, in the course of some 90 seconds, was transmitted to Earth.\n \n Capt. Wilkins's lips were desperately forming the word \"Leak?\"\n \n Air, Major Winship said silently.\n \n Leak?\n \n Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It was a frog-like, unvocal expletive.\n \n \n\n \n Comprehension dawned. Capt. Wilkins nodded and started to turn away. Major Winship caught his arm and nodded his head toward the loose jack.\n \n Oh.\n \n Capt. Wilkins nodded and smiled. He reached across and plugged the speaker in again.\n \n \"... Freedom 19! Hello, Freedom 19! Come in!\"\n \n \"We're here,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"All right? Are you all right?\"\n \n \"We're all right. A-Okay.\" Major Winship, mindful of the extent of his potential audience, took a deep breath. \"Earlier this morning, the Soviet Union fired an underground atomic device for the ostensible purpose of investigating the composition of the lunar mass by means of seismic analysis of the resultant shock waves. This was done in spite of American warnings that such a disturbance might release accumulated stresses in the long undisturbed satellite, and was done in the face of vigorous American protests.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins tapped his helmet and gestured for him to swivel around. The turn was uncomfortably tight and complicated by the restraining cables. Capt. Wilkins began replacement of the air bottle.\n \n \"These protests have proved well founded,\" Major Winship continued.\n\"Immediately following the detonation, Freedom 19 was called on to withstand a moderately severe shifting of the Lunar surface. No personnel were injured and there was no equipment damage.\"\n \n Capt. Wilkins tapped his shoulder to indicate the new air bottle was being inserted. Another tap indicated it was seated. Major Winship flicked the appropriate chest button and nodded in appreciation.\n \n \"However,\" he continued, \"we did experience a minor leak in the dome, which is presently being repaired.\"\n \n \"The Soviet Union,\" came the reply, \"has reported the disturbance and has tendered their official apology. You want it?\"\n \n \"It can wait until later. Send it by mail for all I care. Vacuum has destroyed our organic air reconditioner. We have approximately three weeks of emergency air. However, Base Gagarin reports no damage, so that, in the event we exhaust our air, we will be able to obtain the necessary replacement.\"\n \n The wait of a little better than three seconds for the response gave the conversation a tone of deliberation.\n \n A new voice came on. \"We tried to contact you earlier, Major. We will be able to deliver replacements in about ten days.\"\n \n \"I will forward a coded report on the occurrence,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"Let us hear from you again in ... about three hours. Is the leak repaired?\"\n \n \"The leak has not yet been repaired. Over and out.\"\n \n He nodded to Capt. Wilkins and leaned back.\n \n Methodically, Capt. Wilkins set about disconnecting the major from the transmitter.\n \n \"Wow!\" said Major Winship when he was once more in communication. \"For a moment there, I thought....\"\n \n \"What?\" Capt. Wilkins asked with interest.\n \n \"I could see myself asking them to ask the Russians to ask Finogenov to get on the emergency channel to ask you to charge the air bottle. I never felt so ... idiotic is not quite strong enough ... there for a minute in my whole life. I didn't know how much emergency air was left, and I thought, my God, I'll never live this down. All the hams in the world listening, while I try to explain the situation. I could see the nickname being entered in my files: aka. The Airless Idiot. I tell you, that was rough.\"\n \n \n\n III\n \n Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler returned with the calking compound. It occupied the rear section of the land car. Lt. Chandler sat atop it. It was a fifty-five gallon drum.\n \n The airlock to Freedom 19 was open. \"What is that ?\" asked Major Winship, squinting out into the glaring sunlight.\n \n \"That,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"is the calking compound.\"\n \n \"You're kidding,\" said Capt. Wilkins.\n \n \"I am not kidding.\"\n \n Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler came inside. Capt. Wilkins mounted a bunk.\n \n \"Why didn't you just borrow a cupful?\" Major Winship said sarcastically.\n \n \"It's this way,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"They didn't have anything but\n55-gallon drums of it.\"\n \n \"Oh, my,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"I suppose it's a steel drum. Those things must weigh....\"\n \n \"Actually, I think you guys have got the general wrong,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"He was out, himself, to greet us. I think he was really quite upset by the quake. Probably because his people had misfigured so bad.\"\n \n \"He's too damned suspicious,\" Major Winship said. \"You know and I know why they set that blast off. I tried to tell him. Hell. He looks at me like an emasculated owl and wants to know our ulterior motive in trying to prevent a purely scientific experiment, the results of which will be published in the technical press for the good of everybody. I'll bet!\"\n \n \"About this drum,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n \"Well, like I said, it's this way,\" Lt. Chandler resumed. \"I told him we needed about a pint. Maybe a quart. But this stuff you have to mix up. He only had these drums. There's two parts to it, and you have to combine them in just the right proportion. He told me to take a little scale—\"\n \n \"A little scale?\" asked Capt. Wilkins, rolling his eyes at the dome.\n \n \"That's what I told him. We don't have any little scale.\"\n \n \"Yeah,\" said Captain Lawler, \"and he looked at us with that mute, surprised look, like everybody, everywhere has dozens of little scales.\"\n \n \"Well, anyway,\" Lt. Chandler continued, \"he told us just to mix up the whole fifty-five gallon drum. There's a little bucket of stuff that goes in, and it's measured just right. We can throw away what we don't need.\"\n \n \"Somehow, that sounds like him,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"He had five or six of them.\"\n \n \"Jesus!\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"That must be three thousand pounds of calking compound. Those people are insane.\"\n \n \"The question is,\" Capt. Lawler said, \"'How are we going to mix it?' It's supposed to be mixed thoroughly.\"\n \n They thought over the problem for a while.\n \n \"That will be a man-sized job,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"Let's see, Charlie. Maybe not too bad,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"If I took the compressor motor, we could make up a shaft and ... let's see ... if we could....\"\n \n \n\n \n It took the better part of an hour to rig up the electric mixer.\n \n Capt. Wilkins was profusely congratulated.\n \n \"Now,\" Major Winship said, \"we can either bring the drum inside or take the mixer out there.\"\n \n \"We're going to have to bring the drum in,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n \"Well,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"that will make it nice and cozy.\"\n \n It took the four of them to roll the drum inside, rocking it back and forth through the airlock. At that time, it was apparent the table was interposing itself.\n \n Lt. Chandler tried to dismantle the table. \"Damn these suits,\" he said.\n \n \"You've got it stuck between the bunk post.\"\n \n \"I know that.\"\n \n \"I don't think this is the way to do it,\" Major Winship said. \"Let's back the drum out.\"\n \n Reluctantly, they backed the drum out and deposited it. With the aid of Capt. Lawler, Lt. Chandler got the table unstuck. They passed it over to Major Winship, who handed it out to Capt. Wilkins. Captain Wilkins carried it around the drum of calking compound and set it down. It rested uneasily on the uneven surface.\n \n \"Now, let's go,\" said Major Winship.\n \n Eventually, they accomplished the moving. They wedged the drum between the main air-supply tank and the transmitter. They were all perspiring.\n\"It's not the weight, it's the mass,\" said Capt. Wilkins brightly.\n \n \"The hell it isn't the weight,\" said Lt. Chandler. \"That's heavy.\"\n \n \"With my reefer out,\" said Major Winship, \"I'm the one it's rough on.\" He shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"They should figure a way to get a mop in here, or a towel, or a sponge, or something. I'll bet you've forgotten how much sweat stings in the eyes.\"\n \n \"It's the salt.\"\n \n \"Speaking of salt. I wish I had some salt tablets,\" Major Winship said.\n\"I've never sweat so much since basic.\"\n \n \"Want to bet Finogenov hasn't got a bushel of them?\"\n \n \"No!\" Major Winship snapped.\n \n \n\n \n With the drum of calking compound inside, both Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler retreated to the bunks. Capt. Wilkins maneuvered the mixing attachment. \"I feel crowded,\" he said.\n \n \"Cozy's the word.\"\n \n \"Watch it! Watch it! You almost hit me in the face plate with that!\"\n \n \"Sorry.\"\n \n At length the mixer was in operation in the drum.\n \n \"Works perfectly,\" said Capt. Wilkins proudly.\n \n \"Now what, Skip? The instructions aren't in English.\"\n \n \"You're supposed to dump the bucket of stuff in. Then clean the area thoroughly around the leak.\"\n \n \"With what?\" asked Major Winship.\n \n \"Sandpaper, I guess.\"\n \n \"With sandpaper?\" Major Winship said, emptying the bucket of fluid into the drum. \"We don't have any sandpaper.\"\n \n \"It's been a long day,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n \"Mix it thoroughly,\" Lt. Chandler mused. \"I guess that means let it mix for about ten minutes or so. Then you apply it. It sets for service in just a little bit, Finogenov said. An hour or so, maybe.\"\n \n \"I hope this doesn't set on exposure to air.\"\n \n \"No,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"It sets by some kind of chemical action. General Finogenov wasn't sure of the English name for it. Some kind of plastic.\"\n \n \"Let's come back to how we're going to clean around the leak,\" Major Winship said.\n \n \"Say, I—\" interrupted Capt. Wilkins. There was a trace of concern in his voice. \"This is a hell of a time for this to occur to me. I just wasn't thinking, before. You don't suppose it's a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, do you? \"\n \n \"Larry,\" said Major Winship, \"I wouldn't know a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin from—\"\n \n \"Hey!\" exclaimed Capt. Wilkins. \"The mixer's stopped.\" He bent forward and touched the drum. He jerked back. \"Ye Gods! that's hot! And it's harder than a rock! It is an epoxy! Let's get out of here.\"\n \n \"Huh?\"\n \n \"Out! Out!\"\n \n Major Winship, Lt. Chandler, and Capt. Lawler, recognizing the sense of urgency, simultaneously glanced at the drum. It was glowing cherry red.\n \n \"Let's go!\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n \n He and the Major reached the airlock at the same time and became temporarily engaged with each other. Movement was somewhat ungainly in the space suits under the best of conditions, and now, with the necessity for speed, was doubly so. The other two crashed into them from behind, and they spewed forth from the dome in a tangle of arms and legs.\n \n At the table, they separated, two going to the left, two to the right. The table remained untouched.\n \n When they halted, Capt. Wilkins said, \"Get to one side, it may go off like shrapnel.\" They obeyed.\n \n \"What—what—what?\" Capt. Lawler stuttered.\n \n They were still separated, two on one side of the airlock, two on the other.\n \n \"I'm going to try to look,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Let me go.\" He lumbered directly away from the dome for a distance of about fifteen feet, then turned and positioned himself, some five feet behind the table, on a line of sight with the airlock.\n \n \"I can see it,\" he said. \"It's getting redder. It's ... it's ... melting, yes. Melting down at the bottom a little. Now it's falling over to one side and laying on the air tank. The air tank is getting red, too. I'm afraid ... it's weakening it.... Redder. Oh, oh.\"\n \n \"What?\" said Capt. Lawler.\n \n \"Watch out! There. There! \" Capt. Wilkins leaped from his position.

With a language barrier and poor communication, the Americans don’t know when they are going to perform the test, so they stand outside in their suits waiting.

He can’t stand the excessive heat and thinks that the explosion has already occurred.\n\nWhen Winship immerses himself in the moon’s environment, he successfully cools down. Within seconds, however, he feels the explosion. The men hear several minutes of static on their communication devices. They realize that their capsule has a dome and is losing pressure. Winship tries to cover the hole with a plastic sheet, but it doesn’t work. He reenters the dome and speaks to the Soviets on the phone. Their leader lets him know that they suffered zero damage and suggests that it’s because their dome is stronger and superior to the Americans’.

Pinov is the Russian on the emergency line, but he does not speak English, so the Americans don't know when it will be safe to enter the dome again. It was hot outside the dome, and the suits' cooling systems could only do so much. Major Winship got tired of waiting and wanted to cool off, so he entered the dome, but as soon as he did so he was thrown off his feet from an explosion. Soon after, some static blocked communications for a minute or two, but then the men had a new problem: the dome was losing pressure, so they were losing air. After their best attempt at patching the hole, they got in touch with the Russians who had not sustained any damage. Major Winship had no patience for General Finogenov, even though the Russian was seemingly embarrassed that there had been a quake caused by his test, as he had promised therew ould not be. Lt. Chandler found the squeeze tubes that they could use to patch the rupture, but they were no longer any good, so Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler headed to Base Gagarin in their land car to ask to borrow calking compound from the Russians.  Major Winship and Capt. Wilkins figured they may as well report back to Earth, but once their communications connect, Major Winship realized he is on emergency air and tries to get help from Capt. Wilkins, but those on Earth heard Winship lose air and gasp. Wilkins caught on just in time, and updated those on Earth as they swaped out their oxygen supplies in their suits. Earth requested a report in three hours, confirming that the dome's leak hadn't been repaired, and Winship was relieved the Soviet didn't have to step in to help with his air issue. When the others returned with the fifty-five gallon drum of calking compound, they marveled at how much the Soviets had on hand, and then moved to make an electric mixer to prepare the compound. They tried to move the drum inside to mix it, but there wasn't room, and they tried to move it back out, so all of the men were sweating again. As they discussed how best to proceed in patching the dome, it occured to Wilkins that it could be a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, and just then they realized that the epoxy had become rock-solid and hot.

According to the Russians, the test will help them determine the composition of the moon by analyzing the resultant seismic activity. However, Major Winship suspects the Russians, led by General Finogenov, are conducting the tests in order to purposefully sabotage American efforts to fortify their moon presence. They struggle to communicate with the Russian base as they await word on the status of their test, and when Major Winship goes back inside the dome to call them again, he is suddenly knocked over by movements of the moon's surface, signifying completion of the test. After the quakes settle, the crew discovers a leak in the protective dome, which causes air to slowly seep out. Luckily, they have an emergency air supply to last three weeks, but they lose a significant amount of calking that could be used to repair the leak. When a plastic sheet fails to patch the damage, Lt. Les Chandler searches for squeeze tubes that can ostensibly repair it. However, he discovers that the paste inside requires air in order to harden and some of the tubes have hardened already. Captain Skip Lawler accompanies Lt. Chandler to Base Gagarin in order to ask for calking that might help repair the patch. In their absence, Major Winship bemoans to Captain Larry Wilkins the luxury in which the Russians live on Base Gagarin compared to their discomfort in the cramped quarters of Freedom 19. He continues to muse about his theory that General Finogenov intentionally caused the explosion to harm their base and cause them to vacate the moon. As they await Lawler and Chandler's return, Capt. Wilkins calls Earth on the radio transmitter so that Winship can report the test explosion and the resulting damage. While he talks, he suddenly runs out of his emergency supply of air, and Wilkins refills it for him. Earth promises to restore their air supply in ten days. When Lawler and Chandler return with the calking compound, the crew spends a good amount of time engineering a large, mechanical mixer since the compound comes in a massive, heavy barrel and must be mixed together in order to use it properly. As Captain Wilkins begins mixing the compound, he suddenly realizes that it is a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin. The resin hardens, and the crew rushes out of the dome just before it melts, tips over the barrel, and ignites the air tank next to it, causing a massive explosion.

This suggests that there’s a power dynamic between the two nations, and Winship, as an American, does not want to appear weak in front of the Soviets. Winship wants to keep his American crew safe, but his pride is equally important at this point. As a result of Winship’s refusal to say the word “help,” he ends up stepping outside of the dome before the explosion occurs. \n\nLater, Winship called General Finogenov, the Soviet leader, to report some damage to their dome.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n I\n \n The horses and packs were loaded before we went aboard the scoutship. The scout bay is no more than a great oversized airlock with a dozen small ships squatting over their tubes, but it was the last of the Ship that I might ever see, so I took a long final look from the top of the ramp.\n \n There were sixteen of us girls and thirteen boys. We took our places in the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that nobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling lost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to me. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An intelligent runt like me.\n \n He said what I expected. \"Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get together when we get down?\"\n \n I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked him. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crack he'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, \"Not likely. I want to come back alive.\" It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he went back to his place without saying anything.\n \n My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't be telling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect that scrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the meantime, I've got brains as a consolation.\n \n After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps. We sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and then we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have to leave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.\n \n Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He's the only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't go partners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that crack about being a snob.\n \n The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact the Ship had had with it—and we were the ones who dropped them—was almost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council debate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was all right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to us kids because they never tell you anything about the place they're going to drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that much if Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.\n \n I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody else was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried when I said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that wasn't in public.\n \n \n\n \n It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really, because I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me unhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month. Planets make me feel wretched.\n \n The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and calves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on a piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere and little grubby things just looking for you to crawl on. If you can think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty imagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells—I've been on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but not for me.\n \n We have a place in the Ship like that—the Third Level—but it's only a thousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up a level or down a level and be back in civilization.\n \n When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the sea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested hills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They don't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his gear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still smarting from the slap I'd given him.\n \n In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see Jimmy—if he would get back alive.\n \n It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the nearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound like fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\n \n Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow for fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They do figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time you're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to the Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship is a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that something has to be done in a closed society to keep the population from decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to keep the population steady.\n \n I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be found at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes. Venie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start getting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next landing, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't have anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the bad moment any longer.\n \n The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird, and in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the color of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\n \n \n\n II\n \n The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the lights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in the dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach if it's really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in thirty gone.\n \n I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three things in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others. The first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot I could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to camp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces, though not with that meatball Jimmy D.\n \n No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take nothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from nobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\n \n I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November—too close to Year End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was spring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got back we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to look forward to.\n \n In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking animals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty good, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the best meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I wondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and they've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good that I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\n \n On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the hillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching it in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a hard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks of horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't identify.\n \n One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when they dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the actual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on Earth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were established, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have draft animals.\n \n The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight, as well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything else in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies were planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that could have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have had to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll bet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.\n \n \n\n \n We'd come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the road. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.\n \n I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined bend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There were five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures alive.\n \n They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and knobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for faces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were almost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They made a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded along.\n \n I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the men on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as cats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line and he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That one wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.\n \n He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he had a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we reached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow me. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the face he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man looks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That was why I kept riding.\n \n He said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head? There be escaped Losels in these woods.\"\n \n I told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it was that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though. Generally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say anything. It seemed smart.\n \n \"Where be you from?\" he asked.\n \n I pointed to the road behind us.\n \n \"And where be you going?\"\n \n I pointed ahead. No other way to go.\n \n He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and Daddy, who should know better.\n \n We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you'd better ride on from here with us. For protection.\"\n \n He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a mouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether everybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International English spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit with him.\n \n One of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they'd been watching us all the while. He called to the hard man.\n \n \"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at all. We mought as well throw him back again.\"\n \n The rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he expected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.\n \n The hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us to Forton for protection.\"\n \n I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving along and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes. I felt uncomfortable.\n \n I said, \"I don't think so.\"\n \n What the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and reached for the rifle in his saddle boot.\n \n I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over with the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he didn't want to be fried.\n \n I said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\"\n \n They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.\n \n When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let's go.\"\n \n They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I could see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with narrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling tones said, \"Look here, kid....\"\n \n \"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It surprised me. I didn't think I sounded that mean. I decided he just didn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot.\n \n After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the creatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get them now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next bend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and the creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.\n \n I put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my mind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes I even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels.\n \n \n\n III\n \n When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my great-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it, nestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than the last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.\n \n My face must have been like that as I rode along the road.\n \n The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave way to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of the green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before hadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.\n \n But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or something.\n \n I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody questioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving silently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've seen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.\n \n Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received a jolt that sickened me.\n \n By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were cold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to a gallop.\n \n I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all stone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were no machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the edge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the window—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.\n \n But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't see one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There were little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All the boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why Horst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but I decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the clocks tick on this planet.\n \n But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They swarmed. I saw a family come out of a house—a father and four children. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me then—these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I closed my eyes until it passed.\n \n \n\n \n The first thing you learn in school is that if it weren't for idiot and criminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The evacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people wouldn't have died. There wouldn't have been eight billion people. But, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in their path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth had and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.\n \n I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough foresight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some others like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I wouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.\n \n What happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up blowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The older people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the Council should know.\n \n For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt really frightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I felt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I whomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.\n \n I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk again. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's smart and brains I needed.\n \n How do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method. For one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you want to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody? Who? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind up with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think of was to find a library, but that might be a job.\n \n I'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the late afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was starting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the sky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what had gone wrong.\n \n I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal. The scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to drop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I triggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't know why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.\n \n The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my head, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started bucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain idiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me overhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours. Not too different, but not ours.\n \n \n\n \n One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and we wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that takes an advanced technology to build.\n \n \n\n \n I felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to a campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't help but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent buildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more than a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof.\n \n I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man, his wife and their three children. The kids were running around and playing, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father came and pulled him away.\n \n The kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said hello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I had two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until that moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these kids. Isn't that horrible?\n \n About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man I had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He had white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never seen before.\n \n When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered around. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the children tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go, so the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd accent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness, it seemed just right.\n \n It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in a house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a nice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony errand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the poor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the handkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her dear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to defeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.\n \n I wished for the same for myself.\n \n The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids off to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the camp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I couldn't see far into the dark.\n \n A voice there said, \"I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this one, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're not.\"\n \n Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the campfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the fire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets and mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now what they used the high-walled pen for.\n \n I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the night. I should have used my head. I hadn't and now it was time to take leave.\n \n I never got the chance.\n \n \n\n \n I was just heaving the saddle up on Ninc when I felt a hand on my shoulder and I was swung around.\n \n \"Well, well. Horst, look who we have here,\" he called. It was the one who'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He was alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.\n \n I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he went down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him and reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from behind and pinned my arms to my side.\n \n I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly hand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a lungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I'm told—but he didn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet and dragged me off.\n \n When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped dragging me and dropped me in a heap. \"Make any noise,\" he said, \"and I'll hurt you.\"\n \n That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'd threatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things to do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight for that. \"I ought to club you anyway,\" he said.\n \n The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting the animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.\n \n \"No,\" he said. \"Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what we can use.\"\n \n The other one didn't move. \"Get going, Jack,\" Horst said in a menacing tone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally backed down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me being kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his bunch.\n \n But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under my jacket.\n \n Horst turned back to me and I said, \"You can't do this and get away with it.\"\n \n He said, \"Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of trouble. So don't give me a hard time.\"\n \n He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I didn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.\n \n \"The courts won't let you get away with this,\" I said. I'd passed a courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or something stuffy like that.\n \n He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I knew I'd goofed.\n \n \"Boy, boy. Don't talk about the courts. I be doing you a favor. I be taking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go to court and they'll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leaving you your freedom.\"\n \n \"Why would they be doing that?\" I asked. I slipped my hand under my jacket.\n \n \"Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the Ships,\" Horst said. \"That be enough. They already have one of you brats in jail in Forton.\"\n \n I was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, with all my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him.\n \n He said, \"The kid's got some good equipment. But I can't make out what this be for.\" He held out my pickup signal.\n \n Horst looked at it, then handed it back. \"Throw it away,\" he said.\n \n I leveled my gun at them—Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, \"Hand that over to me.\"\n \n Horst made a disgusted sound.\n \n \"Don't make any noise,\" I said, \"or you'll fry. Now hand it over.\"\n \n I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the saddle. \"What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.\"\n \n \"I can't remember,\" he said. \"But it be coming to me. Hold on.\"\n \n I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind and the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, \"Good enough,\" to the others who'd come up behind me.\n \n I felt like a fool.\n \n Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and said in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was natural and mine wasn't, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it until it cracked and fell apart.\n \n Then he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard that my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\"\n \n I said calmly, \"You big louse.\"\n \n It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I can remember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of my face and then nothing.\n \n Brains are no good if you don't use them.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "8ae98e9c174643e8a6c42be06fd58733", "response_text": "The story begins on a scoutship with 29 fourteen-year-olds.

Members of the Ship’s population, upon turning fourteen, are dropped off on a planet with a horse, food and clothes, a pistol, and a pickup signal so that they may be picked up a month later, forced to survive on their wits and skills. \n\tJimmy Dentremont, one of the children about to be dropped off whom Mia considers to be of similar intelligence as herself, approaches her and asks if she wants to partner up during the trial. She teasingly refuses, and Jimmy disembarks the ship to begin his trial. Mia is dropped off at another location with her horse Ninc, and we learn of her dislike for planets: she is unaccustomed to the gravity, the fauna, and the smell.  \n\tOn her third day of riding, Mia discovers a road and five men herding grotesque green creatures. As she catches up with them, she notices that they are armed. Their leader, who she judges to have a mean face, invites her to ride with them to Forton. When she refuses, he gestures towards his rifle; however, she quickly draws her sonic pistol and forces the men to disarm. Twenty minutes of riding later, she leaves the men, allowing them to return for their weapons. \n\tMia enters a town whereupon she encounters a family with four children and realizes that the population of the planet engage in unregulated reproduction. She is disgusted by this behaviour, remembering that it was such behaviour that led to the overpopulation of Earth and the need to evacuate onto the Great Ships. Overhead, she notices a scout ship, similar to the one that dropped her off on Tintera, and wonders what it is doing there. \n\tNow at a campsite, Mia rests and observes the interaction between an old man and a family with three children. He tells the children the tale of Baba Yaga, an evil witch who lived in a house that stood on chicken legs. Baba Yaga’s stepdaughter is sent to live with her, and foils her stepmother’s attempt to get rid of her. \n\tSuddenly, Mia notices commotion at the edge of the camp, and realizes that the five men whom she held at gunpoint earlier had arrived. As she makes to leave, one of the men pins her and calls over the others. He tells Mia that it is obvious she is from a Ship, and that one of her friends was imprisoned in Forton. Mia quickly levels her gun at him, asking for the name of her friend. As he stalls, she is struck by another one of the men, and her pickup signal is destroyed shortly before she is knocked out.\n"}, {"worker_id": "101", "uid": "95215f5ccaec46e091924e2317b7e810", "response_text": "Mia is a fourteen year old girl aboard Earth's ship after the planet's evacuation.

She is accompanied by other children that she has known, some friends, most of them she is indifferent about. Once Mia is dropped onto Tintera along with her horse Ninc, she gets through the first night feeling frightened and lonely. For the next few days, she roams the planet in search of people to stick with. As she explores, she notes that Tintera is home to odd animals. Mia eventually finds a road and travels down it, meeting a group of men on horseback. The men question Mia, calling her a boy, and insist that she join them. Mia declines, to which the men draw their weapons at her. However, she raises her sonic pistol at them and is able to get away. Mia continues until she reaches a town, where she discovers that the people there are Free Birthers: people who were blamed for Earth's downfall and have multiple children.

WALLACE\n \n Illustrated by EMSH\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic race an inferiority complex—but then he tried to climb it!\n \n\n \n In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long though narrower ribbons.\n \n Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good imitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n \n \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was not unexpected—non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the ages before space travel— and yet each planetary race can interbreed with a minimum of ten others ! That's more than a legend—one hell of a lot more!\"\n \n \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my species.\"\n \n \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own world, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and that's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human development.\n \n \n\n \n \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the beginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on Emmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle. And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to breed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may extend to Kelburn.\"\n \n \n\n \n Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n \n \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind of planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a hundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a few of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists stretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n \n \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the Stone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude that Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout this section of the Milky Way.\"\n \n \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across thousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\" commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n \n \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n \n \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the result of parallel evolution—not when a hundred human races are involved, and only the human race.\"\n \n \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories about himself.\"\n \n It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous though not always the most advanced—Ribboneers had a civilization as high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were others—and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got together—but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n \n Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in helping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating principle?\" asked Sam Halden.\n \n \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n \n \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close. We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but was a little further along. When we project back into time those star systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n \n The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he was interested.\n \n \n\n \n Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the stars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion of it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n \n He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're looking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and, for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant. There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain together, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we calculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n \n Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped the motion.\n \n \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n \n There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n \n Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n \n \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n \n \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n \n \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate with those they were adjacent to two hundred thousand years ago !\"\n \n \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\" murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that satisfies the calculations?\"\n \n \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other mammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically. The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the time right.\"\n \n Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two ends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n \n \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic light-years—then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our exploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it this trip.\"\n \n \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\n\"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n \n \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd better ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n \n Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn was the most advanced human type present, but while there were differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And there was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and this was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some respect.\n \n The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of your pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n \n \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region we're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to have an expert—and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational ability.\"\n \n Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other plans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are the incentives?\"\n \n Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the Ribboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the profits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n \n \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n\"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me, you'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound roll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n \n They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n \n \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take you all day—it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that I'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly everywhere in this sector—places men have never been.\"\n \n There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n \n \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his ribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the region toward which we're heading.\"\n \n \n\n \n Firmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and an equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the mating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of his place in the human hierarchy.\n \n Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter, wouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how long and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy to see why.\n \n Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the biologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n \n \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more about these things than I do.\"\n \n \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still complains.\"\n \n \n\n \n Halden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n \n \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes through a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n \n It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher humans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't prepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's reaction was quite typical.\n \n \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n \n \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do something about it.\"\n \n \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing I can do.\" Halden paused thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n \n \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n \n \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n \n \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as fast as they grow.\"\n \n \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays. Use them.\"\n \n \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now they won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The animals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that way.\"\n \n Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n \n \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n \n It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n \n \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n \n \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.\n\"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n \n Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices everywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n \n They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down because there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were trying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n \n Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n \n \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of privileges.\"\n \n Halden started. So she knew that the crew was calling her that! Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't said it. It didn't help the situation at all.\n \n \n\n \n Taphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body, he wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never quite still.\n \n He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech tells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n \n Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n \n \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n \n \"Neither do we.\"\n \n The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n \n \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A typical pest.\"\n \n Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n \n \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.\n\"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n \n \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's smarter?\"\n \n \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's strong enough.\"\n \n \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical ancestor?\"\n \n Emmer didn't look like the genius he was—a Neanderthal genius, but nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy hands through shaggier hair.\n \n \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of their camp.\"\n \n \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all humans—late or early and male or female—look remarkably alike. If you are an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\"\n \n \n\n \n Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures? Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and we'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world was one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story structures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were forty feet high.\"\n \n \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n \n \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all, not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five thousand years—and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n \n \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n \n \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from ours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and long-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found. Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us did.\"\n \n \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n \n \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and late species. It's well known that individuals among my people are often as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we don't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the planets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n \n \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked Taphetta.\n \n \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n \n And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of atomic—because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves aloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it was tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\n \n \n\n \n Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this discovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n \n It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing where we came from.\"\n \n \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment was required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual curiosity.\"\n \n \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live? When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than physiology is changed—the pattern of life itself is altered. Things that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n \n \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in cultural discoveries.\"\n \n \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've achieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n \n \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.\n\"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics, but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n \n Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So, working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and produced us. They were master biologists.\"\n \n \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk using bait for your pest.\"\n \n He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been bothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n \n \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as much as you think you will. The difference is this: My terms don't permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n \n Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding anything. Halden examined his own attitudes. He hadn't intended, but could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition? He couldn't, and it was too late now—whatever knowledge they acquired would have to be shared.\n \n That was what Taphetta had been afraid of—there was one kind of technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now.\n \n \n\n \n \"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing up. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n \n Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound animals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n \n Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a miniature keyboard.\n \n \"Ready?\"\n \n When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them exactly.\"\n \n At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n \n Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began nibbling what it could reach.\n \n Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up and mauled the other unmercifully.\n \n \n\n \n It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none. Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within reach, it climbed into the branches.\n \n The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying away, still within range of the screen.\n \n Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent defeat.\n \n This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n \n The small one stood still till the last instant—and then a paw flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed. The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped moving.\n \n The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been found— and laid it down .\n \n \n\n \n At Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too bright for anything to be visible.\n \n \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out that the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n \n \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their machines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n \n \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n \n \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n \n \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't have to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough, they'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n \n \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a creature without real hands?\"\n \n \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try—and they'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n \n \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of marrying you.\"\n \n \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew that, in relation to her, he was not advanced.\n \n \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n \n Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To her, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n \n They went to his cabin.\n \n She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she wasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless, except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on the violet end of the spectrum.\n \n She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on primeval Earth.\"\n \n He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as her own world. She had something else in mind.\n \n \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n \n \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't have subhuman monsters.\"\n \n \"It would be a step up—for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension. It had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make them start lower than I am?\"\n \n The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another, it governed personal relations between races that were united against non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n \n \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n \n \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n \n It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a permanent union.\n \n \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n \n \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it lead me astray.\"\n \n \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific about it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n \n \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't like him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n \n \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough. There's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\"\n \n \n\n \n She provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race had a body like hers and she knew it.\n \n \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and I would be infertile.\"\n \n \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act unconcerned.\n \n \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n \n His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n \n She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh give when his knuckles struck it.\n \n She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n \n \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the blood and pain.\"\n \n She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back and looked at herself critically.\n \n \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it healed by morning.\"\n \n She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across the bridge. Then she came over to him.\n \n \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n \n He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage, invisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still feel that attraction to her?\n \n \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and he's even more savage than I am.\"\n \n \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too much, though. You're just right.\"\n \n He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what Emmer would do—and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage—what advantage?—for the children she intended to have. Outside of that, nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he wanted her.\n \n \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry you in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children I have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n \n The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not completely her fault. Besides....\n \n Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior children—and they might be his.\n \n He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were they all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime toward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over—no, through —everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry—onward and upward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger was turned.\n \n \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already broken it once.\"\n \n He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "103", "uid": "8f4bf470977a4c4abc9410bd38d43dfb", "response_text": "The story starts with four of the species of the spectrum of human development together, talking and explaining about the possibility of mating with different species on the spectrum to Taphetta the Ribboneer.

Halden explains to Taphetta that there are hundreds of independently-evolved human species on just as many worlds, each at various stages of human development. The crew of Halden’s expedition, humans from the various human-inhabited worlds, represents the range of human development: Emmer is a Neanderthal-type archeologist who represents early humanity, Halden is an early-middle human, Meredith is a linguist from an advanced-middle human society, and Kelburn is a mathematician from the far advanced side of human evolution. \nTaphetta, himself from an advanced civilization, is initially uninterested in Halden’s theories of human evolution. However, as Kelburn elaborates on the adjacency mating principle, an observation supporting the humans’ hypothesis of a common ancestor which distributed humans throughout the galaxy, he becomes interested. Taphetta accepts the humans’ invitation to be their pilot for the expedition, on the condition that they use his contract. \n\tAn engineer from the ship’s hydroponics department, which is responsible for regulation of the ship’s air, reports to Meredith, who is physically attractive and wearing a revealing skirt, that Taphetta is not fond of the air.

Despite the engineer’s efforts, the animal is resistant to pesticides and is intelligent enough to avoid the electric traps.

As he considers using the bait, Taphetta asks Emmer about the archeological evidence of their common ancestor on his home planet. The Neanderthal reveals that relics of massive proportions indicate the size of the common ancestor, and that they were likely long-lived and able to travel faster than light. Halden hypothesizes that their ancestor was unable to find a suitable planet, so instead left modified versions of themselves on each planet they visited.

Curious, and slightly skeptical, of the mission, Taphetta interrogates Sam Halden, a biologist, and Kelburn, a mathematician, about their theory of how humans evolved. Through analyzing the galactic routes of the human race and their locations throughout history, the team believes they have pinned the general home of the big ancestor. Taphetta agrees to help in the mission, under the condition that the team agrees to his own proposed contract rather than their own. As Taphetta prepares for navigation, he notes to Firmon, head of hydroponics, that he is bothered by the air quality on the ship. Firmon attempts to improve the air, however is met with an issue; the plants on the ship are being eaten by an unknown animal that hides within its machinery. With options limited to rebuilding the ship or baiting the animals through a risky experiment, Taphetta is again skeptical of the conditions of the ship. He requests that the team answer more questions while he thinks it over, and inquires about the big ancestor and its qualities. Emmer, a Neanderthal archaeologist, recounts his experiences growing up around the ruins of the ancestors; the infrastructure was all that they left behind, with no other scrap of information that would indicate their existence, though it is likely that they left in search of another planet to live on while improving themselves through the alteration of their germ plasm. Taphetta then questions the motives of the mission, to which Emmer and Halden consider the abilities of the big ancestor, and how much of an achievement it would be to gain the knowledge they possessed biologically. Holden asks Taphetta what the difference was between the contract the team proposed and his own; he responds and says that his contract ensured the discoveries made on this mission would not be withheld for humans exclusively. With Taphetta agreeing to baiting the animals, the team uses a realistic puppet that resembles the pests, with a retractable knife that is able to kill them when they get close.

But they erred in thinking the Old Ones were too big to be clever.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1949. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes, and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's radial velocity changed relative to the Quest III , as for forty hours the ship had decelerated.\n \n They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the Quest III drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown sated with the sight of wonders—of multiple systems of giant stars, of nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.\n \n But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the Quest III's crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might lie at the long journey's end. For the Quest III was coming home; the sun ahead was the Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.\n \n \n\n \n Knof Llud, the Quest III's captain, came slowly down the narrow stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber, a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was little more than a hollow shell.\n \n Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've sighted Earth.\"\n \n A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has identified it—no more.\"\n \n But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n \n Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n \n He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do you feel, Lesra?\"\n \n She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't know. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n \n He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n \n \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone by— there —and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world we left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n \n The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't worry. Things may have changed—but we'll manage.\" But his face had hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear within him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge. There's a new course to be set now—for Earth.\"\n \n He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes gleamed with unshed tears.\n \n Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to Earth.\n \n Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted before we get that far.\"\n \n Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said hesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n \n Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any of the other Quests returned successful, or if they returned at all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's possible—not likely, though—that something has happened to break civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been forgotten altogether.\"\n \n \n\n \n He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he sat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n \n The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n \n There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find Lesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n \n He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the Quest III's fuel stores and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n \n Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred Earth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and months had passed for the Quest III in interstellar flight while years and decades had raced by on the home world.\n \n Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about three dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a report to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were still interested.\n \n Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He slid it onto the reproducer.\n \n His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and confident than he knew it was now.\n \n \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time since leaving Earth.\n \n \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n \n \"Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n \n \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth; friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the Quest ships will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream, humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n \n Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still have been ringing in his ears.\n \n He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another, later, one.\n \n \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that that system, too, is devoid of planets.\n \n \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably true—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n \n \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan.... This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless and transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids, or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the twentieth century.\n \n \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was in sight—so we launched the Quests . Perhaps our effort will prove as futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward, expanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n \n \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"\n \n \n\n \n Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first disappointments.\n \n He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange longing....\n \n \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n \n \"According to plan, the Quest III has reached its furthest point from Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more stars and stellar systems—but hope is small that any of those will prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined already.\n \n \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead along the Milky Way.\n \n \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n \n \"Even so—by expending its remaining fuel freely, the Quest III could achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey—even if enough fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n \n \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other Quests , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization—if the other expeditions failed also—will have reached a dangerously unstable phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from overpopulation.\n \n \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be forgotten back there?\n \n \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know—some of them still show signs of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that was once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n \n \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n \n Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n \n The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them once in translation from the ancient English....\n \n \n ... for my purpose holds\n \n\n To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n \n\n Of all the western stars, until I die.\n \n \n\n \n Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to turn back. The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able to alter that.\n \n He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he would want to do that, though.\n \n Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed to falter one moment in flight.\n \n \n\n \n The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea what it had been—a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have been done. The Quest III's collision armor was nonmaterial and for practical purposes invulnerable.\n \n Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled, frowning—surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence, maybe—it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n \n He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded cat.\n \n \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain, we're being attacked!\"\n \n \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically, then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis. There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start—three short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,\n\"Now—attacked by what?\"\n \n \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a sixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the Quest III's framework. The navigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them long enough to tell much.\"\n \n \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n \n In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were big; he had heard his father's words.\n \n \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you, huh, Dad?\"\n \n Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\" He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n \n There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts. Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The Quest III shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n \n To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge, most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof Llud.\n \n \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n \n Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and they're all banging away at us.\"\n \n The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice from the same position.\n \n Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently. His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in his father.\n \n \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they can't touch us as long as our power lasts—or until they bring up some bigger stuff.\"\n \n \n\n \n The mild shocks went on—whether from projectiles or energy-charges, would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting the Quest III's shell was doing it at velocities where the distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n \n But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded—usually vaporized by the impact—and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its deflection was negligible.\n \n The people in the Quest III would have felt nothing at all of the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities, was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n \n One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in wait for us. But why on Earth—\"\n \n \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why—on Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\"\n \n The Quest III bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end—perhaps in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking, always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons—but suddenly on one of the vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn apart.\n \n Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was paying attention to him. The men on the Quest III's bridge looked questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored too direct a hit.\"\n \n He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the Quest III , except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance and speed—but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than Gwar Den had at first supposed—not large enough to hold even one man. Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n \n \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy they had explored, but one of the other Quests might have encountered and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to conquer.\n \n \n\n \n It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind it.\n \n Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight hours.\"\n \n \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n \n \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n \n \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not knowing why we're being attacked.\"\n \n Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a thought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological advantage, too!\"\n \n His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have noticed it.\"\n \n \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he hadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts swinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n \n Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in a position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I was going to say—I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n \n And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies, repeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n \n \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition Quest III ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and querying again, \"Who are you ?\"\n \n There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the Quest III too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of his ship.\n \n Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time, Captain—I've got some data on Earth now.\"\n \n Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up inquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n \n \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.\n\"First of all—there are no lights on the night side. And on the daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces of cities, canals, and the like—but it does not.\n \n \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine moss or even a coarse mold.\"\n \n \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n \n \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well—we tried photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is opaque to it.\"\n \n The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps you can answer some of these riddles before—\"\n \n \" We know who you are ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a strange accent, \" and pleading will do you no good. \"\n \n \n\n \n Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from him once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating tape.\n \n He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling with space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be—the sooner, if you continue toward Earth.\"\n \n Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice—which must be coming from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships—was not very smart; it had already involuntarily told him a couple of things—that it was not as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the Quest III's ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n \n He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \" Are you human? \"\n \n The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are not.\"\n \n The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply. Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully into its field.\n \n \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud woodenly. He named a vision frequency.\n \n \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the changes that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the Quest I's commander.\"\n \n Knof Llud stiffened. The Quest I , launched toward Arcturus and the star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the Quest III the most hopeful of the expeditions—and its captain had been a good friend of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to him?\"\n \n \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some time,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short pause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n \n Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly, but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the Quest III , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n \n He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question. Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n \n The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a poisonous hatred.\n \n \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\"", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "072b266a911a4f7e8c3768c11a49f65d", "response_text": "A spaceship named Quest III is moving towards a color-changing star, but this time it is the Sun.

It made a one-night pitch on a Venusian swamp-town—to find that death stalked it from the jungle in a tiny ball of flame.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories May 1943. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He knocked over the pitcher of thil , but it didn't matter. The pitcher was empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not very hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to spring them.\n \n \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and down the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\n \n I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\"\n \n \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through a curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says I'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in Space, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\n \n \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a lot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey! I've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for eleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down! Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\n \n I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults Buckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face unless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\n \n Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his grey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian girl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the slanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round toward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\n \n I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to Shannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.\n \n I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\n \n Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter Shannon?\"\n \n Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled pleasantly and said, very gently:\n \n \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\n \n I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if he was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon settled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\n \n The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed in dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of grey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully clean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust with their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\n \n There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale blue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.\n \n He said, \"I don't think you understand.\"\n \n I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair back. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I got my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed, and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\n \n Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\n \n I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise. It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up, quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\n \n Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you, Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.\"\n \n \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\"\n \n The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\n \n Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm Shannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at the table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\n \n The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face stayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start that it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I ever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more than you could see through sheet metal.\n \n I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,\n\"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking like hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\n \n The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon Beamish. I wish to—ah—charter your circus.\"\n \n \n\n \n I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't say anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh pitcher of thil on the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n \n \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n \n Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have independent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten the burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\n \n Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and started to get up. I kicked him under the table.\n \n \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\n \n He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish ignored him. He went on, quietly,\n \n \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most valuable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of toil and boredom....\"\n \n I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\n \n \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no entertainment of the— proper sort has been available. I propose to remedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n \n Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to speak, and I kicked him again.\n \n \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel several engagements....\"\n \n He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n \n \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n \n The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I glared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n \n It was Gow, our zoo-man—a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran colony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the scenery—scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the curtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger than the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n \n He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n \n \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n \n Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude ain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n \n I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n \n He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to fit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome, see? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot ship'll hold her.\"\n \n He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish cleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n \n \"Gertrude?\"\n \n \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I finished for him.\n \n \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp Venusian cansin . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt Brothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n \n She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be a little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she wouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking circus than even I could stand.\n \n Beamish looked impressed. \"A cansin . Well, well! The mystery surrounding the origin and species of the cansin is a fascinating subject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n \n We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have at least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n \n It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker. Beamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a second I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my stomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n \n \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be agreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled off half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n \n \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in the morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n \n We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made grab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n \n \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs. Here.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We can get lushed enough on this.\"\n \n Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back he said suddenly,\n \n \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n \n \"Yeah.\"\n \n \"It may be crooked.\"\n \n \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I yelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n \n Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic where the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n \n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He poked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More thildatum !\"\n \n \n\n \n It was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where Shannon's Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late as it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting around and smoking and looking very ugly.\n \n It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless under the two moons. There's a smell to Mars, like something dead and dried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown red dust gritted in my teeth.\n \n Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to the roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his feet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\"\n \n They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I grinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more than money. It grates on a man's pride to have to sneak in and out of his own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in weeks we'd come in at the front door.\n \n I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly, Bucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts. Bucky yawned and stretched sleepily.\n \n \"Now?\" he said.\n \n \"Now,\" I said.\n \n We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join in. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went home happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.\n \n The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the green girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the muscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers and joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the passageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.\n \n Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.\n\"They're good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I've rewarded them.\"\n \n I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.\n \n \"Let's go see Gertrude.\"\n \n I didn't want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going into the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I'm a city guy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But Bucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.\n \n \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\"\n \n \"You're a pal, Jif. Bes' li'l' guy inna worl'....\"\n \n The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he'd fall down the ladder and break his neck. That's why I went along. If I hadn't.... Oh, well, what's a few nightmares among friends?\n \n It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was a dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude's hand. We started down the long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and compression units.\n \n Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn't near as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It's the smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them, breathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled around them as strong as the cage bars.\n \n Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and then wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again. A high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell, ripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.\n \n It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same time. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I could think of, and I couldn't hear myself doing it. Presently a great metallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow had them nicely conditioned to that gong.\n \n \n\n \n But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel them inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared of them. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought—like I wanted to put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night, all of a sudden....\n \n Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She's gettin' worse,\" he said. \"She's lonesome.\"\n \n \"That's tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an owl's. He swayed slightly. \"That's sure tough.\" He sniffled.\n \n I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank and even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a deep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a cansin . There's only two of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say will make much difference.\n \n They're what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old Dame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The cansins were pretty successful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and now there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even the Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.\n \n I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck some place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little bird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big.\n \n I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage with her hands—yeah, hands—hanging over her knees and her snaky head sunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything. Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.\n \n The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the mane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes clear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like old Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.\n \n Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\"\n \n Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow! Nobody's ever seen a male cansin . There may not even be any.\"\n \n Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head. The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That close, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold inside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....\n \n Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You'll have to snap her out of this, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.\"\n \n He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood looking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he turned to Gertrude.\n \n \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak's wreck and everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know her. I can do things with her. But this time....\"\n \n He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a woman's talking about a sick child.\n \n \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain't sure.\"\n \n \"Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need her.\" I took Shannon's arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.\"\n \n He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look at us. Bucky sobbed.\n \n \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But it's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there with Gertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\"\n \n \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\"\n \n We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed high and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all around us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.\n \n Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist rose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly with blue, cold fire.\n \n I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow—for God's sake!\"\n \n I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp and heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and roars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all I could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.\n \n I thought, \" Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wants to kill us! \" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I sobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.\n \n One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I rolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the hollow of his shoulder.\n \n The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the back of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my mouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.\n \n Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,\n\"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!\"\n \n Then I went out.\n \n \n\n II\n \n Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. His little brown face was crinkled with laughter. He'd lost most of his teeth, and he gummed thak -weed. It smelt.\n \n \"You pretty, Mis' Jig,\" he giggled. \"You funny like hell.\"\n \n He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him and said, \"Where's Shannon? How is he?\"\n \n \"Mis' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis' Jig. Mis' Gow come nickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!\"\n \n I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down a couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the washstand—I was in my own cell—and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned snakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch plaid. I felt sick.\n \n Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was a big burn across his neck. He said:\n \n \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\"\n \n I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\"\n \n Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.\n \n \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in. Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\"\n \n I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far. Nobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head.\n \n \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\"\n \n \"Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.\"\n \n \"One hundred U.C.'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge mining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\"\n \n I shrugged. \"You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off the creditors.\"\n \n \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn't a comfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign.\" He put his hand on the latch and looked at my feet. \"And—uh—Jig, I....\"\n \n I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!\"\n \n We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge, and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking like a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian strong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had kittens.\n \n Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. It lived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out of their pants. Circus people are funny that way.\n \n Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time. Anybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. It didn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at dinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I was ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.\n \n Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our itinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It was Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a bunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle of it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.\n \n I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and our router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.\n \n \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\"\n \n I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and went out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they weren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus heat was already sneaking into the ship.\n \n While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude, screaming.\n \n \n\n \n The canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in the mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I stood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking.\n \n I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was standing in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her triangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn't have anything on but her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn't sound nice.\n \n You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with the electric power they carry in their own bodies. They're Venusian middle-swampers, they're not human, and they never forget it.\n \n Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with white reptilian teeth.\n \n \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can smell it in the swamp wind.\"\n \n The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under her jaw pulsed like a toad's, and her eyes were red.\n \n \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken. They are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\"\n \n She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight and cold. Bucky said,\n \n \"Let's eat if they have a bar in this dump.\"\n \n We weren't half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing field when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We could see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd.\n \n He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or four tries to get our names out clear enough to understand.\n \n Bucky said, \"Jig—it's Sam Kapper.\"\n \n We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled around to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man who crawled and whimpered in the mud.\n \n Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and carnivals. He'd given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren't too broke, and we were pretty friendly.\n \n I hadn't seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed, hard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick, looking down at him.\n \n Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over like animals I've seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over and put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.\n \n I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn't pay much attention. I only caught a glimpse of the man's face as he straightened up. I didn't realize until later that he looked familiar.\n \n We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a couple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled the curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the cigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.\n \n Bucky said gently, \"Okay, Sam. Relax. What's the trouble?\"\n \n \n\n \n Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines of his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered with mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n \n He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it and brought it out.\"\n \n The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help me,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n \n \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's got to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they wouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n \n He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know how they found out about it, but they did.

There were quite a lot of men in the place. At first glance they looked okay—a hard-faced, muscular bunch of miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n \n Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never did any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n \n The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender was a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair coiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n \n I leaned on the bar. \" Lhak ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a green bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n \n \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out cold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n \n \" Selak ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n \n I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing behind me.

Its quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n \n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux.

They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards. But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards.

Possibly somebody like Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n \n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There wasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n \n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n \n \n\n \n The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact, Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n \n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under the Ultrawelfare State.\n \n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home, Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have miserably failed.\"\n \n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy. In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n \n \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has been trained. There aren't two men on North America—there aren't two men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the road to his destiny.\"\n \n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n \n \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our ancestors did?\"\n \n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous pastimes.\"\n \n Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food, clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well. He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to our pleas for a few more trips?\"\n \n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\n \n \n\n \n Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that, seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken man.\n \n He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one need face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n \n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been increasingly hard to come by—even though in our minds, Hans, we are near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space Exploration.\"\n \n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n \n \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n \n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement. Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends justify the means?\"\n \n Gubelin blinked at him.\n \n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read of the sailor and his way of life?\"\n \n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to do with it?\"\n \n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points, tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n \n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n \n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\n\"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it, nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n \n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern methods, my dear chap.\"\n \n \n\n \n II\n \n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n \n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n \n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree, a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of dangers met and passed.\n \n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n \n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did you need?\n \n It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n \n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution. They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week. It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none of them ever really becoming efficient.\n \n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees were needed, a draft lottery was held.\n \n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be sold for a lump sum on the market.\n \n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was obviously called for.\n \n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n \n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks, fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n \n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long denied him.\n \n Si was going to do it differently this time.\n \n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The works. But nothing but the best.\n \n \n\n \n To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided. A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations, titles.\n \n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n \n In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The screen went dead.\n \n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n \n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one place really made sense. The big city.\n \n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He might as well do it up brown.\n \n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n \n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n \n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the direction of the pressure was reversed.\n \n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n \n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present your credit card within ten minutes.\"\n \n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n \n He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that, he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n \n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the mattress.\n \n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that registration could be completed.\n \n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias. This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n \n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a dime a dozen.\n \n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\n\"Kudos Room.\"\n \n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\n \n \n\n \n At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either. However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made his way to the bar.\n \n There was actually a bartender.\n \n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment. He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n \n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to take a look at the others present.\n \n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n \n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked and then swallowed.\n \n \" Zo-ro-as-ter ,\" he breathed.\n \n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her eyes. Every pore, but every pore, was in place. She sat with the easy grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n \n His stare couldn't be ignored.\n \n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n \n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about building the drink.\n \n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be on me?\"\n \n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n \n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n \n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a space pin?\"\n \n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n \n \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n \n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you been on at least a Moon run.\"\n \n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\n\"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave you.\"\n \n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n \n She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n \n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\n\"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to if they say Seymour.\"\n \n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having met him.\n \n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n \n \" Academician Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him Doc ?\"\n \n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like that. But how come you cried?\"\n \n \n\n \n She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her, as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the planets....\"\n \n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\n \n \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\n \n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job, it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop. So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those spaceships costs?\"\n \n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\"\n \n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\n \n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like. Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\n \n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\n \n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\n \n She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\"\n \n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard, but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "106", "uid": "a2c1299a0e864fc0b9c84425c3f49aa6", "response_text": "Seymour Pond has just retired from his career as the last astronaut from the Ultrawelfare State at the age of thirty. At his going away party he is given a watch, and academics like Lifting Gubelin and Dr Hans Girarad-Perregaux speak on his behalf. Si has decided to take the money he has saved up from his time working, which most people in the Ultrawelfare state don't, and live a simple comfortable life. He intends to never work again, after his six space flights. The currency used in the state was universal, controlled by a personal credit card. Because most jobs were automated, few people had to work, so most people lived off of a set welfare, and those selected to work were given a little extra compensation. Si was one of these people. Gubelin and Perregaux are both horrified by the fact that Pond has decided to take an early retirement. He was their only pilot for their space program, and if they were to get another, it would take at least a year of training. Without a pilot, they are worried that their funding will be cut, and the space program will be shut down. They scheme together as to how to get Pond back in the space program. They think that the only way to get him back would be to make sure he was left without any money, and therefore would have no choice but to return to his former position. \nSi is planning a big night out. He has always gone and celebrated when there was a cause, and tonight, he was planning to spend at least half of all the money in his account. He gets dressed in his retirement rank suit to go out, checks his balance, and then takes his vacuum tube to New york city.

People are selected for different jobs based on their physical and mental qualifications. People who don't work have their assigned shares to live off of, and those that are selected to work are given a little extra as compensation. When the society was first formed, they tried to give everyone work, but they realised that it was no good to have people working for two hours, two days a week, so they created the draft lottery. Most people live in small apartments, and the fortunate living Si, are able to afford vacuum tubes, which can take you anywhere in an instant.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n This guard smelled trouble and it could be counted on to come—for a nose for trouble was one of the many talents bred here!\n \n\n\n I\n \n His name was Liam O'Leary and there was something stinking in his nostrils. It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble was yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of guards in Estates-General Correctional Institution—better known to its inmates as the Jug—and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent of trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to reach his captaincy.\n \n And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.\n \n He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like her into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she couldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n \n He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n \n The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block guard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n \n O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the Civil Service Guide to Prison Administration : \"Detainees will be permitted to speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary was a man who lived by the book.\n \n She burst out: \"I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told me I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush up, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and told them I refused to mop.\"\n \n The block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk—that's what she was telling you to do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is—\"\n \n \"Shut up, Sodaro.\"\n \n \n\n \n Captain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was attractive and young—not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off to a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the disciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and looked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for him to judge their cases.\n \n He said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your cell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you should have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time—\"\n \n \"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first offense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in the mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The block guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench, and she claimed the same business—said she didn't understand when the other one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard warned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\"\n \n Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I don't care. I don't care!\"\n \n O'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\"\n \n It was the only thing to do—for her own sake as much as for his. He had managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted to say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up forever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was clearly the next step for her.\n \n All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet to Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here. What's she in for?\"\n \n \"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her, Cap'n. She's a figger-lover!\"\n \n Captain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked\n\"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the smell from his nose.\n \n What got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty business? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the yard, wondering about her. She'd had every advantage—decent Civil Service parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If anything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and look what she had made of it.\n \n The direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no exception, but with the difference that his is the one species that creates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment that clans formed, specialization began—the hunters using the weapons made by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the ceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.\n \n Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From the born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved to the point of smaller contact and less communication between the specializations, until now they could understand each other on only the most basic physical necessities—and not even always then.\n \n But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree of civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation of each specialization—social and genetic measures to make them breed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man, or at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the specializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer or Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized, would be good at no specialization.\n \n And the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups are the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal enforcement of a demonstrable fact.\n \n \"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and touched his cap as O'Leary passed by.\n \n \"Evening.\"\n \n \n\n \n O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted those things, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'd noticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much to sweep—the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the cobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's job to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they didn't.\n \n There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a perfectly good civil-service position—better than post-office clerk, not as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He was proud of it. It was right that he should be proud of it. He was civil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to do a good, clean civil-service job.\n \n If he had happened to be born a fig—a clerk , he corrected himself—if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been proud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk—or a mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n \n Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe, but they had a—well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary was a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a touch of envy how comfortable it must be to be a wipe—a laborer . No responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and loaf, work and loaf.\n \n Of course, he wouldn't really want that kind of life, because he was Civil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that weren't meant to be—\n \n \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n \n He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of maintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n \n \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n \n Conan, now—he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the next hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on the prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the cars going—and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up in another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status restored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he certainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as Civil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n \n So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n \n \n\n II\n \n Every prison has its Greensleeves—sometimes they are called by different names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State called it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the snake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what it is called; it is a place for punishment.\n \n And punishment is what you get.\n \n Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the disciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its inhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of its own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And like any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them. Their names were Sauer and Flock.\n \n Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She was in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an irritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor below, when she heard the yelling.\n \n \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n \n The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck guard. The outside guard looked impassively back—after all, he was on the outside.\n \n The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n \n The outside guard shrugged.\n \n \"Detail, halt !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as the three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the head of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care of 'em, will you? Especially the lady—she's going to like it here, because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her company.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O guards.\n \n The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary knows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all riled up.\"\n \n \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up already.\"\n \n Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no attention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the tanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block corridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you could ignore the prisoners—they simply could not move fast enough, against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a rule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all the time—only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's restraining garment removed.\n \n Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate—and fell flat on her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was like walking through molasses.\n \n The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy, auntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right direction and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules say you got to wear it and the rules—Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his head, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry in the Greensleeves.\n \n However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from tears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she passed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge to retch.\n \n \n\n \n Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were laborers—\"wipes,\" for short—or, at any rate, they had been once. They had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even for them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big, grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe five-footer with the build of a water moccasin—and the sad, stupid eyes of a calf.\n \n Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\"\n \n \"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell.\n \n \"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so as not to disturb the lady!\" He screeched with howling, maniacal laughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble, Flock!\"\n \n \"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that, Sauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\"\n \n The howling started all over again.\n \n The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off the tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take a turn in here for a while?\"\n \n \"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head.\n \n \"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah, I don't know why I don't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat your head off!\"\n \n \"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he grinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know you can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\"\n \n \"Shut up !\" yelled the inside guard.\n \n Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help it. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting under her skin. They weren't even—even human , she told herself miserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the satisfaction of hearing her—they were animals!\n \n Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly that resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly normal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against the vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was good that Sauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious system—\n \n But did they have to scream so?\n \n The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to weeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!\n \n It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless, because noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very long.\n \n \n\n III\n \n \"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden.\n \n \"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his little round eyes looked terrified—as perhaps they should have. Warden Godfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in the Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the last decent job he would have in his life.\n \n \"Trouble? What trouble?\"\n \n O'Leary shrugged. \"Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This afternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\"\n \n The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what did you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball in the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\"\n \n \"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the outside—an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes don't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\"\n \n O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that it didn't smell right?\n \n \"For instance—Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's a pretty good old girl—that's why she's the block orderly. She's a lifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women. But today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she told Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now Mathias wouldn't—\"\n \n The warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about that kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured himself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a desk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped a pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the scalding heat.\n \n He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.\n \n \"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have your job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is just as important as my job,\" he said piously. \" Everybody's job is just as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to our own jobs. We don't want to try to pass .\"\n \n O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was that for the warden to talk to him?\n \n \"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean, after all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was a great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \" You know you don't want to worry about my end of running the prison. And I don't want to worry about yours . You see?\" And he folded his hands and smiled like a civil-service Buddha.\n \n \n\n \n O'Leary choked back his temper. \"Warden, I'm telling you that there's trouble coming up. I smell the signs.\"\n \n \"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last.\n \n \"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose—\"\n \n \"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with all your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee, made a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not noticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into it this time.\n \n He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.\n \n \"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you tonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the—' Oh, curse the thing.\"\n \n His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.\n \n That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary; they gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.\n \n \"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What the devil do you want? Don't you know I'm—What? You did what ? You're going to WHAT?\"\n \n He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror. Whatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like clamshells in a steamer.\n \n \"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\"\n \n And he hung up—more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his fingers.\n \n The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.\n \n Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it didn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good. Because five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the hard-timers of the Greensleeves.\n \n His name was Flock.\n \n He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him, thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the crazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the face of an agonized man.\n \n The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"\n \n Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did happen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that actuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison rules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the Greensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case had to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.\n \n \"Rest period\" it was called—in the rule book. The inmates had a less lovely term for it.\n \n \n\n \n At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.\n \n Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat bed—nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields had a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out. Score one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed the backs of her thighs gingerly—and slowly, slowly, for the eddy currents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against rubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.\n \n The guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She proudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds. He didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while she attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male prisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was grateful. At least she didn't have to live quite like a fig—like an underprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.\n \n Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's the matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an asbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.\n \n Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over.\n \n The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe. Couldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real enough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I—I—\"\n \n \"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The guard lumbered around Flock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in here, he told himself—not for the first time. And imagine, some people didn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he realized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning. Almost like meat scorching.\n \n It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the stinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to get all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if he didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was pretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little vain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability to make the rounds in two minutes, every time.\n \n Every time but this.\n \n For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.\n \n The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was Flock—astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't been in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there was something that glinted and smoked.\n \n \"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut with pain.\n \n But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining, smoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though it had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God knows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how—filed, filed to sharpness over endless hours.\n \n No wonder Flock moaned—the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly cooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv had been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.\n \n \n\n \n \"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get hurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell him not to, you hear?\"\n \n He was nearly fainting with the pain.\n \n But he hadn't let go.\n \n He didn't let go. And he didn't stop.\n \n \n\n IV\n \n It was Flock on the phone to the warden—Flock with his eyes still streaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing the two bound deck guards.\n \n Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the voice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and hating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt himself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the guards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got your guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\"\n \n And he snapped the connection.\n \n O'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\"\n \n The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated, and picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison operator: \"Get me the governor—fast.\"\n  Riot!\n \n \n The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.\n \n It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Seniority with his manager and their wives—and just when he was holding the Porkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole.\n \n It broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Field to the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to a Red Alert that was real.\n \n It reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highway checkpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the nineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug.\n \n Riot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.\n \n A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in every limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds of thousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under the impact of the news from the prison.\n \n For the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merely a street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasers relaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the corrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipes and no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together.\n \n \n\n \n Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The airmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of the alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched and yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained and their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled for tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids couldn't get up yet—it was the middle of the night.\n \n And as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers struggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing area to hear.\n \n They caught the words from a distance—not quite correctly. \"Riot!\" gasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I told Charlie they'd get out of hand and—Alys, we aren't safe. You know how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club and stand right by the door and—\"\n \n \"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children querulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the use of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd better come along to Supply with me and draw a gun—you'll need it before this night is over.\"\n \n But the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the scramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of trouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called them out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such levels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n \n The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a whistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they were the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up their picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers in each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n \n They were ready for the breakout.\n \n But there wasn't any breakout.\n \n The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The helicopters hung on—still ready, still waiting.\n \n The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again. They stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed. The prison below them was washed with light—from the guard posts on the walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of the guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n \n North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed land, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed lights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion from their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded tenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to window; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n \n \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier yelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the whirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout from the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be right in the middle of it!\"\n \n He was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it—for every man, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of it. There was no place anywhere that would be spared. No mixing. That was the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There's no harm in a family fight—and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers a clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties than blood or skin?\n \n But the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and once they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The breakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever known.\n \n But he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to come.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "bb1472ba897f44c49a4476a40f783490", "response_text": "Liam O’Leary is the captain of the guards at the Estates-General Correctional Institution (also known as the Jug).

WESTLAKE\n \n\n Criminals, beware; the Scorpion is on your trail! Hoodlums fear his fury—and, for that matter, so do the cops!\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n The man with the handkerchief mask said, \"All right, everybody, keep tight. This is a holdup.\"\n \n There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall at his desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger. There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic named Rodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English and Miss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was Mister Anderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There was Mrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in their joint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward\n(Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollars dimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his father in the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels, withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were three bank robbers.\n \n The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, they all wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers, brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefs over the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulled low over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous.\n \n The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-two calibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One of the others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and said to him in a low voice, \"Think about retirement, my friend.\" The third one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walked quickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it with money.\n \n It was just like the movies.\n \n The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall and the customers all over against the back wall, while the second man stayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed money into the black satchel.\n \n The man by the door said, \"Hurry up.\"\n \n The man with the satchel said, \"One more drawer.\"\n \n The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, \"Keep your shirt on.\"\n \n That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ran pelting in her stocking feet for the door.\n \n \n\n \n The man by the door spread his arms out and shouted, \"Hey!\" The man with the gun swung violently back, cursing, and fired the gun. But he'd been moving too fast, and so had Miss English, and all he hit was the brass plate on Mr. Featherhall's desk.\n \n The man by the door caught Miss English in a bear hug. She promptly did her best to scratch his eyes out. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson went scooting out the front door and running down the street toward the police station in the next block, shouting, \"Help! Help! Robbery!\"\n \n The man with the gun cursed some more. The man with the satchel came running around from behind the counter, and the man by the door tried to keep Miss English from scratching his eyes out. Then the man with the gun hit Miss English on the head. She fell unconscious to the floor, and all three of them ran out of the bank to the car out front, in which sat a very nervous-looking fourth man, gunning the engine.\n \n Everyone except Miss English ran out after the bandits, to watch.\n \n Things got very fast and very confused then. Two police cars came driving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank, and the car with the four robbers in it lurched away from the curb and drove straight down the street toward the police station. The police cars and the getaway car passed one another, with everybody shooting like the ships in pirate movies.\n \n There was so much confusion that it looked as though the bank robbers were going to get away after all. The police cars were aiming the wrong way and, as they'd come down with sirens wailing, there was a clear path behind them.\n \n Then, after the getaway car had gone more than two blocks, it suddenly started jouncing around. It smacked into a parked car and stopped. And all the police went running down there to clap handcuffs on the robbers when they crawled dazedly out of their car.\n \n \"Hey,\" said Eddie Clayhorn, ten years old. \"Hey, that was something, huh, Mom?\"\n \n \"Come along home,\" said his mother, grabbing his hand. \"We don't want to be involved.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"It was the nuttiest thing,\" said Detective-Sergeant Stevenson. \"An operation planned that well, you'd think they'd pay attention to their getaway car, you know what I mean?\"\n \n Detective-Sergeant Pauling shrugged. \"They always slip up,\" he said.\n\"Sooner or later, on some minor detail, they always slip up.\"\n \n \"Yes, but their tires .\"\n \n \"Well,\" said Pauling, \"it was a stolen car. I suppose they just grabbed whatever was handiest.\"\n \n \"What I can't figure out,\" said Stevenson, \"is exactly what made those tires do that. I mean, it was a hot day and all, but it wasn't that hot. And they weren't going that fast. I don't think you could go fast enough to melt your tires down.\"\n \n Pauling shrugged again. \"We got them. That's the important thing.\"\n \n \"Still and all, it's nutty. They're free and clear, barrelling out Rockaway toward the Belt, and all at once their tires melt, the tubes blow out and there they are.\" Stevenson shook his head. \"I can't figure it.\"\n \n \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth,\" suggested Pauling. \"They picked the wrong car to steal.\"\n \n \"And that doesn't make sense, either,\" said Stevenson. \"Why steal a car that could be identified as easily as that one?\"\n \n \"Why? What was it, a foreign make?\"\n \n \"No, it was a Chevvy, two-tone, three years old, looked just like half the cars on the streets. Except that in the trunk lid the owner had burned in 'The Scorpion' in big black letters you could see half a block away.\"\n \n \"Maybe they didn't notice it when they stole the car,\" said Pauling.\n \n \"For a well-planned operation like this one,\" said Stevenson, \"they made a couple of really idiotic boners. It doesn't make any sense.\"\n \n \"What do they have to say about it?\" Pauling demanded.\n \n \"Nothing, what do you expect? They'll make no statement at all.\"\n \n The squad-room door opened, and a uniformed patrolman stuck his head in. \"The owner of that Chevvy's here,\" he said.\n \n \"Right,\" said Stevenson. He followed the patrolman down the hall to the front desk.\n \n The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, tall and paunchy. \"John Hastings,\" he said. \"They say you have my car here.\"\n \n \"I believe so, yes,\" said Stevenson. \"I'm afraid it's in pretty bad shape.\"\n \n \"So I was told over the phone,\" said Hastings grimly. \"I've contacted my insurance company.\"\n \n \"Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd come with me?\"\n \n \n\n \n On the way around, Stevenson said, \"I believe you reported the car stolen almost immediately after it happened.\"\n \n \"That's right,\" said Hastings. \"I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm a wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car was gone.\"\n \n \"You left the keys in it?\"\n \n \"Well, why not?\" demanded Hastings belligerently. \"If I'm making just a quick stop—I never spend more than five minutes with any one customer—I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?\"\n \n \"The car was stolen,\" Stevenson reminded him.\n \n Hastings grumbled and glared. \"It's always been perfectly safe up till now.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. In here.\"\n \n Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. \"It's ruined!\" he cried. \"What did you do to the tires?\"\n \n \"Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.\"\n \n Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. \"Look at that! There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What did you use, incendiary bullets?\"\n \n Stevenson shook his head. \"No, sir. When that happened they were two blocks away from the nearest policeman.\"\n \n \"Hmph.\" Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,\n\"What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of kids had stolen the car.\"\n \n \"It wasn't a bunch of kids,\" Stevenson told him. \"It was four professional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in a bank holdup.\"\n \n \"Then why did they do that ?\"\n \n Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the crudely-lettered words, \"The Scorpion\" burned black into the paint of the trunk lid. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"It wasn't there before the car was stolen?\"\n \n \"Of course not!\"\n \n Stevenson frowned. \"Now, why in the world did they do that?\"\n \n \"I suggest,\" said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, \"you ask them that.\"\n \n Stevenson shook his head. \"It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking about anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us.\" He looked at the trunk lid again. \"It's the nuttiest thing,\" he said thoughtfully....\n \n That was on Wednesday.\n \n The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the Daily News brought a crank letter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is, the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a newspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.\n \n The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:\n \n Dear Mr. Editor:\n \n The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion fights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!\n \n \n Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION\n \n The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It didn't rate a line in the paper.\n \n \n\n II\n \n The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man went berserk.\n \n It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood, composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.\n \n Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the third time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home, brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.\n \n As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to awaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he really ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.\n \n Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the house at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked bedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and\n\"stop acting like a child.\" Neighbors reported to the police that they heard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, \"Go away! Can't you let a man sleep?\"\n \n At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence, a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of similar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted from his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being annoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells at them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the hand and shoulder.\n \n Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming out the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,\n\"Murder! Murder!\" At this point, neighbors called the police. One neighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television stations, thereby earning forty dollars in \"news-tips\" rewards.\n \n \n\n \n By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the Belt Parkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at Idlewild Airport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a position across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work with a Zoomar lens.\n \n In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house, firing at anything that moved.\n \n The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One concentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors and ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to search for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home audience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and undershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of the house.\n \n The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere, and firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the corner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr. Higgins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The police used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they had the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway. Higgins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge anyone present to hand-to-hand combat.\n \n The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day and all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken. Higgins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again.\n \n The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and dramatically.\n \n Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of shooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped and threw the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered down to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell barrel first onto the lawn.\n \n Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a wounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall into the arms of the waiting police.\n \n They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually trying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was shouting: \"My hands! My hands!\"\n \n They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers were red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was another burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder.\n \n Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn ointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The neighbors went home and telephoned their friends.\n \n On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the precincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy individual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle. He touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all.\n \n He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the stock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, \"The Scorpion.\"\n \n \n\n \n You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political connections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As Captain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both more imaginative than most—\"You gotta be able to second-guess the smart boys\"—and to be a complete realist—\"You gotta have both feet on the ground.\" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was best not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.\n \n The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.\n\"Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?\" he demanded.\n \n \"I'm not sure,\" admitted Stevenson. \"But we've got these two things. First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for no reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk. Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle all of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to prove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.\"\n \n \"He says he put that on there himself,\" said the captain.\n \n Stevenson shook his head. \"His lawyer says he put it on there. Higgins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's case. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.\"\n \n \"He put it on there himself, Stevenson,\" said the captain with weary patience. \"What are you trying to prove?\"\n \n \"I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And what about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?\"\n \n \"They were defective,\" said Hanks promptly.\n \n \"All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the trunk?\"\n \n \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain. \"Kids put it on before the car was stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows? What do they say?\"\n \n \"They say they didn't do it,\" said Stevenson. \"And they say they never saw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been there.\"\n \n The captain shook his head. \"I don't get it,\" he admitted. \"What are you trying to prove?\"\n \n \"I guess,\" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, \"I guess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made that rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.\"\n \n \"What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are you trying to hand me?\"\n \n \"All I know,\" insisted Stevenson, \"is what I see.\"\n \n \"And all I know,\" the captain told him, \"is Higgins put that name on his rifle himself. He says so.\"\n \n \"And what made it so hot?\"\n \n \"Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do you think made it hot?\"\n \n \"All of a sudden?\"\n \n \"He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.\"\n \n \"How come the same name showed up each time, then?\" Stevenson asked desperately.\n \n \"How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these things happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they write 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens all the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?\"\n \n \"But there's no explanation—\" started Stevenson.\n \n \"What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just gave you the explanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty idea—like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there was a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned refrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting all upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch. Remember?\"\n \n \"I remember,\" said Stevenson.\n \n \"Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,\" the captain advised him.\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson....\n \n The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a crank letter to the Daily News :\n \n Dear Mr. Editor,\n \n You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could not escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is safe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.\n \n \n Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION\n \n Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had seen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the same place, and forgotten.\n \n \n\n III\n \n Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around for the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up carrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on your way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a JD.\n \n The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances on two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and the street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides claimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys from both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that had been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and determined that the matter could only be settled in a war.\n \n The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard. The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no pistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner would have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both entrances.\n \n The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate clubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play chicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of the approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might come wandering through.\n \n Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen years old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine, gum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the Scarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to her. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.\n \n Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were dark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark, particularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone pole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet Raider jacket and waited.\n \n At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The rumble had started.\n \n At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the street. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them carried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks on.\n \n They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey, you kids. Take off.\"\n \n One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\"\n \n \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\"\n \n \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask.\n \n \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Listen, lady,\" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, \"we got a long way to go to get home.\"\n \n \"Yeah,\" said another kid, in a black mask, \"and we're late as it is.\"\n \n \"I couldn't care less,\" Judy told them callously. \"You can't go down that street.\"\n \n \"Why not?\" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete and elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt and a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a black knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. \"Why can't we go down there?\" this apparition demanded.\n \n \"Because I said so,\" Judy told him. \"Now, you kids get away from here. Take off.\"\n \n \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. \"Hey, they're fighting down there!\"\n \n \"It's a rumble,\" said Judy proudly. \"You twerps don't want to be involved.\"\n \n \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went running around Judy and dashing off down the street.\n \n \"Hey, Eddie!\" shouted one of the other kids. \"Eddie, come back!\"\n \n Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase the one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would come running along after her. She didn't know what to do.\n \n A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.\n\"Cheez,\" said one of the kids. \"The cops!\"\n \n \"Fuzz!\" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the schoolyard, shouting, \"Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!\"\n \n But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the schoolyard.\n \n The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving their arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling off their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering. They were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's warning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both schoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy and the rumble was over.\n \n \n\n \n Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great big blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in the yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.\n \n And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault.\n \n \n\n \n Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was impatient as well. \"All right, Stevenson,\" he said. \"Make it fast, I've got a lot to do this morning.

What's the problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?\"\n \n \"Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'\" Stevenson told him. \"One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the Challengers.\"\n \n \"So they changed their name,\" said Hanks.\n \n \"Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?\"\n \n \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\"\n \n \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted that much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever seeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.\"\n \n \"A bunch of juvenile delinquents,\" said Hanks in disgust. \"You take their word?\"\n \n \"Captain, did you read the article in the paper?\"\n \n \"I glanced through it.\"\n \n \"All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started fighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once all the metal they were carrying—knives and tire chains and coins and belt buckles and everything else—got freezing cold, too cold to touch. And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to pull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later collected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been branded 'The Scorpion.'\"\n \n \"Now, let me tell you something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard the police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they threw their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been part of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before they could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed up a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it but weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the neighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not bothering anybody. That's what happened. And all this talk about freezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec punk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to worrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid gangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or you're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business. Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "101", "uid": "0918340a3d5b4c4ab394b2b3a512fafa", "response_text": "The story opens up on a bank robbery. Three men, wearing identical outfits and masks, walk in and threaten the citizens in the bank, raising a weapon. As the men are taking money from behind the counter, a woman, Miss English, makes a run for the door. She is shot at but missed, caught by one of the men at the door, and another citizen, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call for help. The men flee the bank and hop into a stolen car, just missing the incoming police. As the men get away, the car suddenly malfunctions and crashes into another car, and they are eventually caught by the police. Detective Stevenson discusses the incident with Detective Pauling, and he is perplexed by how the tires of the stolen car seemed to melt instantly, and how the words \"The Scorpion\" were branded into the car. The owner of the stolen car, John Hastings, arrives, and he confirms that the words were not on the car before it was stolen. Two days later, the Daily News receives a crank letter, addressed from \"The Scorpion\" and explaining that he fights crime, threatening criminals. The letter was not published. About a month after the robbery, another incident occurs in Brooklyn, where Jerome Higgins murders his wife and injures his sister after spending days in his bedroom. Police and cameramen arrive at his home, where a standoff occurs for an hour before Higgins suddenly throws his rifle and runs outside, his hands burned severely. Stevenson finds the rifle and sees \"The Scorpion\" burned into the side of it. Stevenson goes to Captain Hanks, questioning the similarities between the two events, and Hanks dismisses his conspiracies. The Daily Mail receives another letter, but still does not publish it. On Halloween, two gangs, the Challengers and the Scarlet Raiders, plan a rumble over territory. Judy Canzanetti is a lookout for the Scarlet Raiders, and she is guarding the street when a group of children approach her. Judy warns them to leave, but one of the children goes around her and runs down the street. Suddenly, the police arrive, and Judy warns the gang, but then sees them jumping around and throwing their weapons and jackets.

The getaway car reaches ahead until the car crashes, and the police clap handcuffs on the robbers, taking them to the station. \nBack in the station Detective-Sergeant Stevenson discusses with his colleague what happened. The tires of the getaway car seemed to have melted. The car was normal, apart from the words \"the scorpion\", burned in big black letters on the trunk lid. They meet the owner of the stolen car at the station, who tells them that he never put that sign on the car. That was on Wednesday. On Friday, the Daily News is sent a crank letter from someone signed \"the scorpion\" who tells the paper to warn their readers that \"the scorpion fights crime\" and that criminals are not safe.\nJerome Higgins, a man from Brooklyn goes crazy and kills his wife and injures his sister with a gun. Both neighbours and police surround the house after his sister Mrs.Strober escapes the house. inside, Higgins goes ballistic, shooting at random. That is until Higgins runs out of the house, his hands and shoulder having severe burns. He is taken to get his wounds treated, and then to jail. On the gun, it is burned into the wood \"The Scorpion\". \nThe Sergeant and his Captain discuss these cases.

She sees a group of kids, who she tries to divert, but when one of them escapes and runs in the direction of the fight, she is caught off guard. That is until she hears sirens, and goes to warn the gang. Before she gets there though, all the members of the two gangs jump around, throwing their weapons on the ground and taking off their jackets. It is explained later on by Steavenson that their weapons all of a sudden became freezing cold, as did their jackets, with \"the scorpion\" burned into the backs of them.

The three robbers, who look like triplets, all wear the same outfits. One man draws a pistol while the other one takes the guard's pistol, Mr. Anderson. The last one takes a black satchel bag and fills it with money. Then, they join the fourth robber in a stolen car while the police chase them. It seems that they will get away, but the tires melt, which gives the police the opportunity to apprehend them. On Wednesday, Detective-Sergeant Stevenson finds it very strange, but Detective-Sergeant Pauling tells him it is common for plans to have these flaws. Stevenson mentions that the car has 'The Scorpion' burned into it just as the owner arrives. John Hastings says that he reported his car as soon as it was stolen. Stevenson is surprised that he would leave his keys in it, but Hastings says it is usually safe for him because he is a wine and liquor salesman. Hastings is angry at the police for melting his tires, but Stevenson says the police had no part in that. Both of them are confused by the writing on the car since it was not there before. On Friday, the Daily News receives a letter from The Scorpion that warns the readers of the paper because it fights crime. However, the letter is ignored and filed into the wastebasket instead. The second incident happens in early August when a Brooklyn man named Jerome Higgins goes berserk after failing a Civil Service exam for the third time. The crime is in Canarsie, in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. Mrs. Higgins and his sister, Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, try to wake him up; Mister Higgins kills his wife and injures his sister with a hunting rifle. He then goes on a rampage, barricading himself in the house and shooting at anything that moves. Policemen, firemen, neighbors, ambulance attendants, and even two cameramen from the mobile unit are present. After one hour, Higgins plans to shoot at the camera, but he suddenly throws his rifle away. He then complains about his hands, which are severely burned, and Stevenson finds the words 'The Scorpion' present again. Precinct Captain Hanks tells him that his idea of an external force fighting crime out there is silly, while the Daily News receives a second letter from The Scorpion. The third case details a Hallowe'en rumble in a schoolyard. Judy Canzanetti is made to stand chicken, and she tells a group of kids in Hallowe'en masks to stay away from the schoolyard. The kid named Eddie dashes down the street, and the cops soon appear after. Stevenson tries to bring up how strange it is for both gangs to have 'The Scorpion' on their jackets when the conflict was a territorial war.

Picking a moment, one of the hostages, Miss English, rushes out, but she is stopped, while another captive, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call the police. The robbers hit Miss English into unconsciousness and run away. Police cars come and go in the wrong way, but surprisingly manage to capture the robbers after all. The stupid mistake of the robbers seems suspicious as the car's tires melted for no reason and the stolen car was very noticeable with \"The Scorpion\" written in the back. When the car owner comes, he is very angry and upset, and he mentions the inscription wasn't there before the robbery. Soon, a letter from \"The Scorpion\" is received by a newspaper, saying that the sender will keep fighting crime. About one month later, a clerk murders his wife from a rifle after going berserk. This man, Mr. Higgins, barricades himself at home and fires outside in defense, while his sister runs to the police and the neighbors call. After an hour of no success in arresting the man, he runs out himself with his hands being terribly burnt. The same detective who led the first case, Stevenson, comes to the scene, and sees an engraving \"The Scorpion\" on the rifle. Higgins' lawyer claims the inscription was put by his client, while the least denies it, which the lawyer uses to proclaim him insane. Stevenson holds on to someone else making those inscriptions while Captain Hanks denies the version. Stevenson keeps posing questions making the case strange, but Hanks tries to close the case with explaining everything as primitively as possible. Hanks orders Stevenson to forget his ideas of someone pretending to be a superhero and even threatens him reminding about a precedent. Another warning letter to the readers comes from \"The Scorpion\" to the newspaper, but it's not printed again. Another story takes place on Halloween, two gangs meet to fight for a school yard with knifes and chains. A fifteen year old girl Judy stands chicken on the corner during the fight and sees a bunch of kids heading home, she says them to go another way, but one kid sees the rumble and rushes there. Suddenly the cops come and the gangs do not hear Judy's warning, everyone is arrested. \"The Scorpion\" appears on the participants' jackets after the fight. Turns out the fight didn't happen as all the metallic weapons and leather jackets suddenly got extremely cold to hold. Hanks again finds an explanation - the kids threw all of these away not tore arrested. He again tells Stevenson to stop with this nonsense from the superhero books.

But Macklin is exactly what we need for a quick, dramatic test. We've had it if he turns us down.\"\n \n \"I know,\" Mitchell said, exhaling deeply. \"Somehow the men with the money just can't seem to understand basic research. Who would have financed a study of cyclic periods of the hedgehog? Yet the information gained from that study is vital in cancer research.\"\n \n \"When we prove our results that should be of enough practical value for anyone. But those crummy trustees didn't even leave us enough for a field test.\" Ferris scrubbed his thin hand over the bony ridge of his forehead. \"I've been worrying so much about this I've got the ancestor of all headaches.\"\n \n Mitchell's blue eyes narrowed and his boyish face took on an expression of demonic intensity. \"Ferris, would you consider—?\"\n \n \"No!\" the smaller man yelled. \"You can't expect me to violate professional ethics and test my own discovery on myself.\"\n \n \" Our discovery,\" Mitchell said politely.\n \n \"That's what I meant to say. But I'm not sure it would be completely ethical with even a discovery partly mine.\"\n \n \"You're right. Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches? Our reputations don't go outside our own fields,\" Mitchell said. \"But now Macklin—\"\n \n Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein in the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word\n\"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether his Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been able to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but looked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The government took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the Ideal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.\n \n For the past seven years Macklin—who was the Advanced Studies Department of Firestone University—had been involved in devising a faster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the nearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knew that the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of Ad astra per aspirin .\n \n The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.\n \n Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mild stroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It was known that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of the headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several weeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen around the campus.\n \n \n\n \n Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the laboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chair behind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.\n \n \"Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up?\" Ferris demanded, pausing in mid-stride.\n \n \"I imagine he will,\" Mitchell said. \"Macklin's always seemed a decent enough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trustees meetings.\"\n \n \"He's always treated me like dirt,\" Ferris said heatedly. \"Everyone on this campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash in their smug faces.\"\n \n Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack of scientific detachment.\n \n There came a discreet knock on the door.\n \n \"Please come in,\" Mitchell said.\n \n Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. He looked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell suspected that that was his intention.\n \n He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. \"Good of you to ask me over, Steven.\"\n \n Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. \"How have you been, Harold?\"\n \n Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. \"Fine, thank you, doctor.\"\n \n Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. \"Now what's this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep the explanation simple. Biology isn't my field, you know.\"\n \n Mitchell moved around the desk casually. \"Actually, Doctor, we haven't the right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be an element of risk.\"\n \n The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. \"Now you have me intrigued. What is it all about?\"\n \n \"Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches,\" Mitchell said.\n \n Macklin nodded. \"That's right, Steven. Migraine.\"\n \n \"That must be terrible,\" Ferris said. \"All your fine reputation and lavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearing agony begins, can it?\"\n \n \"No, Harold, it isn't,\" Macklin admitted. \"What does your project have to do with my headaches?\"\n \n \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said, \"what would you say the most common complaint of man is?\"\n \n \"I would have said the common cold,\" Macklin replied, \"but I suppose from what you have said you mean headaches.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Headaches,\" Mitchell agreed. \"Everybody has them at some time in his life. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide by their headaches.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" Macklin said.\n \n \"But think,\" Ferris interjected, \"what a boon it would be if everyone could be cured of headaches forever by one simple injection.\"\n \n \"I don't suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But it would please about everybody else.\"\n \n \"Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscular pains,\" Mitchell said.\n \n \"I see. Are you two saying you have such a shot? Can you cure headaches?\"\n \n \"We think we can,\" Ferris said.\n \n \"How can you have a specific for a number of different causes?\" Macklin asked. \"I know that much about the subject.\"\n \n \"There are a number of different causes for headaches—nervous strain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors, over-indulgence—but there is one effect of all of this, the one real cause of headaches,\" Mitchell announced.\n \n \"We have definitely established this for this first time,\" Ferris added.\n \n \"That's fine,\" Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. \"And this effect that produces headaches is?\"\n \n \"The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain,\" Mitchell said eagerly. \"That is, the constriction of blood vessels in the telencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It's caused by an over-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a virus that feeds on pituitrin.\"\n \n \"That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean the end of the race as well,\" Macklin said. \"In certain areas it is valuable to have a constriction of blood vessels.\"\n \n \"The virus,\" Ferris explained, \"can easily be localized and stabilized. A colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral vessels—and only the cerebral vessels—so that the cerebrospinal fluid doesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain.\"\n \n The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. \"If this really works, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuff makes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than the migraine. How should I go about removing my curse?\" He reinserted the pipe.\n \n \"I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate,\" Ferris said. \"Our discovery will work.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Will work,\" Macklin said thoughtfully. \"The operative word. It hasn't worked then?\"\n \n \"Certainly it has,\" Ferris said. \"On rats, on chimps....\"\n \n \"But not on humans?\" Macklin asked.\n \n \"Not yet,\" Mitchell admitted.\n \n \"Well,\" Macklin said. \"Well.\" He thumped pipe ashes out into his palm.\n\"Certainly you can get volunteers. Convicts. Conscientious objectors from the Army.\"\n \n \"We want you,\" Ferris told him.\n \n Macklin coughed. \"I don't want to overestimate my value but the government wouldn't like it very well if I died in the middle of this project. My wife would like it even less.\"\n \n Ferris turned his back on the mathematician. Mitchell could see him mouthing the word yellow .\n \n \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I know it's a tremendous favor to ask of a man of your position. But you can understand our problem. Unless we can produce quick, conclusive and dramatic proof of our studies we can get no more financial backing. We should run a large-scale field test. But we haven't the time or money for that. We can cure the headaches of one person and that's the limit of our resources.\"\n \n \"I'm tempted,\" Macklin said hesitantly, \"but the answer is go. I mean\n' no '. I'd like to help you out, but I'm afraid I owe too much to others to take the rest—the risk, I mean.\"\n \n Macklin ran the back of his knuckles across his forehead. \"I really would like to take you up on it. When I start making slips like that it means another attack of migraine. The drilling, grinding pain through my temples and around my eyeballs. The flashes of light, the rioting pools of color playing on the back of my lids. Ugh.\"\n \n Ferris smiled. \"Gynergen makes you sick, does it, doctor? Produces nausea, eh? The pain of that turns you almost wrong side out, doesn't it? You aren't much better off with it than without, are you? I've heard some say they preferred the migraine.\"\n \n Macklin carefully arranged his pipe along with the tools he used to tend it in a worn leather case. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"what is the worst that could happen to me?\"\n \n \"Low blood pressure,\" Ferris said.\n \n \"That's not so bad,\" Macklin said. \"How low can it get?\"\n \n \"When your heart stops, your blood pressure goes to its lowest point,\" Mitchell said.\n \n A dew of perspiration had bloomed on Macklin's forehead. \"Is there much risk of that?\"\n \n \"Practically none,\" Mitchell said. \"We have to give you the worst possibilities. All our test animals survived and seem perfectly happy and contented. As I said, the virus is self-stabilizing. Ferris and I are confident that there is no danger.... But we may be wrong.\"\n \n Macklin held his head in both hands. \"Why did you two select me ?\"\n \n \"You're an important man, doctor,\" Ferris said. \"Nobody would care if Mitchell or I cured ourselves of headaches—they might not even believe us if we said we did. But the proper authorities will believe a man of your reputation. Besides, neither of us has a record of chronic migraine. You do.\"\n \n \"Yes, I do,\" Macklin said. \"Very well. Go ahead. Give me your injection.\"\n \n Mitchell cleared his throat. \"Are you positive, doctor?\" he asked uncertainly. \"Perhaps you would like a few days to think it over.\"\n \n \"No! I'm ready. Go ahead, right now.\"\n \n \"There's a simple release,\" Ferris said smoothly.\n \n Macklin groped in his pocket for a pen.\n \n \n\n II\n \n \"Ferris!\" Mitchell yelled, slamming the laboratory door behind him.\n \n \"Right here,\" the small man said briskly. He was sitting at a work table, penciling notes. \"I've been expecting you.\"\n \n \"Doctor—Harold—you shouldn't have given this story to the newspapers,\" Mitchell said. He tapped the back of his hand against the folded paper.\n \n \"On the contrary, I should and I did,\" Ferris answered. \"We wanted something dramatic to show to the trustees and here it is.\"\n \n \"Yes, we wanted to show our proof to the trustees—but not broadcast unverified results to the press. It's too early for that!\"\n \n \"Don't be so stuffy and conservative, Mitchell! Macklin's cured, isn't he? By established periodic cycle he should be suffering hell right now, shouldn't he? But thanks to our treatment he is perfectly happy, with no unfortunate side effects such as gynergen produces.\"\n \n \"It's a significant test case, yes. But not enough to go to the newspapers with. If it wasn't enough to go to the press with, it wasn't enough to try and breach the trustees with. Don't you see? The public will hand down a ukase demanding our virus, just as they demanded the Salk vaccine and the Grennell serum.\"\n \n \"But—\"\n \n The shrill call of the telephone interrupted Mitchell's objections.\n \n Ferris excused himself and crossed to the instrument. He answered it and listened for a moment, his face growing impatient.\n \n \"It's Macklin's wife,\" Ferris said. \"Do you want to talk to her? I'm no good with hysterical women.\"\n \n \"Hysterical?\" Mitchell muttered in alarm and went to the phone.\n \n \"Hello?\" Mitchell said reluctantly. \"Mrs. Macklin?\"\n \n \"You are the other one,\" the clear feminine voice said. \"Your name is Mitchell.\"\n \n She couldn't have sounded calmer or more self-possessed, Mitchell thought.\n \n \"That's right, Mrs. Macklin. I'm Dr. Steven Mitchell, Dr. Ferris's associate.\"\n \n \"Do you have a license to dispense narcotics?\"\n \n \"What do you mean by that, Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said sharply.\n \n \"I used to be a nurse, Dr. Mitchell. I know you've given my husband heroin.\"\n \n \"That's absurd. What makes you think a thing like that?\"\n \n \"The—trance he's in now.\"\n \n \"Now, Mrs. Macklin. Neither Dr. Ferris or myself have been near your husband for a full day. The effects of a narcotic would have worn off by this time.\"\n \n \"Most known narcotics,\" she admitted, \"but evidently you have discovered something new. Is it so expensive to refine you and Ferris have to recruit new customers to keep yourselves supplied?\"\n \n \"Mrs. Macklin! I think I had better talk to you later when you are calmer.\"\n \n Mitchell dropped the receiver heavily. \"What could be wrong with Macklin?\" he asked without removing his hand from the telephone.\n \n Ferris frowned, making quotation marks above his nose. \"Let's have a look at the test animals.\"\n \n Together they marched over to the cages and peered through the honeycomb pattern of the wire. The test chimp, Dean, was sitting peacefully in a corner scratching under his arms with the back of his knuckles. Jerry, their control in the experiment, who was practically Dean's twin except that he had received no injection of the E-M Virus, was stomping up and down punching his fingers through the wire, worrying the lock on the cage.\n \n \"Jerry is a great deal more active than Dean,\" Mitchell said.\n \n \"Yes, but Dean isn't sick. He just doesn't seem to have as much nervous energy to burn up. Nothing wrong with his thyroid either.\"\n \n They went to the smaller cages. They found the situation with the rats, Bud and Lou, much the same.\n \n \"I don't know. Maybe they just have tired blood,\" Mitchell ventured.\n \n \"Iron deficiency anemia?\"\n \n \"Never mind, doctor. It was a form of humor. I think we had better see exactly what is wrong with Elliot Macklin.\"\n \n \"There's nothing wrong with him,\" Ferris snapped. \"He's probably just trying to get us in trouble, the ingrate!\"\n \n \n\n \n Macklin's traditional ranch house was small but attractive in aqua-tinted aluminum.\n \n Under Mitchell's thumb the bell chimbed dum-de-de-dum-dum-dum .\n \n As they waited Mitchell glanced at Ferris. He seemed completely undisturbed, perhaps slightly curious.\n \n The door unlatched and swung back.\n \n \"Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I'm sure we can help if there is anything wrong with your husband. This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr. Mitchell.\"\n \n \"You had certainly better help him, gentlemen.\" She stood out of the doorway for them to pass.\n \n Mrs. Macklin was an attractive brunette in her late thirties. She wore an expensive yellow dress. And she had a sharp-cornered jawline.\n \n The Army officer came out into the hall to meet them.\n \n \"You are the gentlemen who gave Dr. Macklin the unauthorized injection,\" he said.\n \n It wasn't a question.\n \n \"I don't like that 'unauthorized',\" Ferris snapped.\n \n The colonel—Mitchell spotted the eagles on his green tunic—lifted a heavy eyebrow. \"No? Are you medical doctors? Are you authorized to treat illnesses?\"\n \n \"We weren't treating an illness,\" Mitchell said. \"We were discovering a method of treatment. What concern is it of yours?\"\n \n The colonel smiled thinly. \"Dr. Macklin is my concern. And everything that happens to him. The Army doesn't like what you have done to him.\"\n \n Mitchell wondered desperately just what they had done to the man.\n \n \"Can we see him?\" Mitchell asked.\n \n \"Why not? You can't do much worse than murder him now. That might be just as well. We have laws to cover that.\"\n \n The colonel led them into the comfortable, over-feminine living room. Macklin sat in an easy chair draped in embroidery, smoking. Mitchell suddenly realized Macklin used a pipe as a form of masculine protest to his home surroundings.\n \n On the coffee table in front of Macklin were some odd-shaped building blocks such as were used in nursery schools. A second uniformed man—another colonel but with the snake-entwined staff of the medical corps in his insignia—was kneeling at the table on the marble-effect carpet.\n \n The Army physician stood up and brushed his knees, undusted from the scrupulously clean rug.\n \n \"What's wrong with him, Sidney?\" the other officer asked the doctor.\n \n \"Not a thing,\" Sidney said. \"He's the healthiest, happiest, most well-adjusted man I've ever examined, Carson.\"\n \n \"But—\" Colonel Carson protested.\n \n \"Oh, he's changed all right,\" the Army doctor answered. \"He's not the same man as he used to be.\"\n \n \"How is he different?\" Mitchell demanded.\n \n The medic examined Mitchell and Ferris critically before answering. \"He used to be a mathematical genius.\"\n \n \"And now?\" Mitchell said impatiently.\n \n \"Now he is a moron,\" the medic said.\n \n \n\n III\n \n Mitchell tried to stop Colonel Sidney as he went past, but the doctor mumbled he had a report to make.\n \n Mitchell and Ferris stared at Colonel Carson and Macklin and at each other.\n \n \"What did he mean, Macklin is an idiot?\" Mitchell asked.\n \n \"Not an idiot,\" Colonel Carson corrected primly. \"Dr. Macklin is a moron. He's legally responsible, but he's extremely stupid.\"\n \n \"I'm not so dumb,\" Macklin said defensively.\n \n \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" Carson said. \"I didn't intend any offense. But according to all the standard intelligence tests we have given you, your clinical intelligence quotient is that of a moron.\"\n \n \"That's just on book learning,\" Macklin said. \"There's a lot you learn in life that you don't get out of books, son.\"\n \n \"I'm confident that's true, sir,\" Colonel Carson said. He turned to the two biologists. \"Perhaps we had better speak outside.\"\n \n \"But—\" Mitchell said, impatient to examine Macklin for himself. \"Very well. Let's step into the hall.\"\n \n Ferris followed them docilely.\n \n \"What have you done to him?\" the colonel asked straightforwardly.\n \n \"We merely cured him of his headaches,\" Mitchell said.\n \n \"How?\"\n \n Mitchell did his best to explain the F-M Virus.\n \n \"You mean,\" the Army officer said levelly \"you have infected him with some kind of a disease to rot his brain?\"\n \n \"No, no! Could I talk to the other man, the doctor? Maybe I can make him understand.\"\n \n \"All I want to know is why Elliot Macklin has been made as simple as if he had been kicked in the head by a mule,\" Colonel Carson said.\n \n \"I think I can explain,\" Ferris interrupted.\n \n \"You can?\" Mitchell said.\n \n Ferris nodded. \"We made a slight miscalculation. It appears as if the virus colony overcontrols the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum. It isn't more than necessary to stop headaches. But that necessary amount of control to stop pain is too much to allow the brain cells to function properly.\"\n \n \"Why won't they function?\" Carson roared.\n \n \"They don't get enough food—blood, oxygen, hemoglobin,\" Ferris explained. \"The cerebral vessels don't contract enough to pump the blood through the brain as fast and as hard as is needed. The brain cells remain sluggish, dormant. Perhaps decaying.\"\n \n The colonel yelled.\n \n Mitchell groaned. He was abruptly sure Ferris was correct.\n \n \n\n \n The colonel drew himself to attention, fists trembling at his sides.\n\"I'll see you hung for treason! Don't you know what Elliot Macklin means to us? Do you want those filthy Luxemburgians to reach Pluto before we do? Macklin's formula is essential to the FTL engine. You might just as well have blown up Washington, D.C. Better! The capital is replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearly once in a human race.\"\n \n \"Just a moment,\" Mitchell interrupted, \"we can cure Macklin.\"\n \n \"You can ?\" Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man was going to clasp his hands and sink to his knees.\n \n \"Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We have antitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as a beneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary.\"\n \n \"Good!\" Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at the knees.\n \n \"Just you wait a second now, boys,\" Elliot Macklin said. He was leaning in the doorway, holding his pipe. \"I've been listening to what you've been saying and I don't like it.\"\n \n \"What do you mean you don't like it?\" Carson demanded. He added, \"Sir?\"\n \n \"I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be.\"\n \n \"Yes, doctor,\" Mitchell said eagerly, \"just as you used to be.\"\n \n \" With my headaches, like before?\"\n \n Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to frame an answer. \"Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions properly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is a dismal failure.\"\n \n \"I wouldn't go that far,\" Ferris remarked cheerfully.\n \n Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw Macklin slowly shaking his head.\n \n \"No, sir!\" the mathematician said. \"I shall not go back to my original state. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying, worrying.\"\n \n \"You mean wondering,\" Mitchell said.\n \n Macklin nodded. \"Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing. How high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity—say, what was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It's peaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife and all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?\"\n \n Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.\n \n \"That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him,\" Mitchell said.\n \n \"It's not his decision to make,\" the colonel said. \"He's an idiot now.\"\n \n \"No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron. He seems an idiot compared to his former level of intelligence but he's legally responsible. There are millions of morons running around loose in the United States. They can get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of them do. You can't force him into being cured.... At least, I don't think you can.\"\n \n \"No, I can't. This is hardly a totalitarian state.\" The colonel looked momentarily glum that it wasn't.\n \n Mitchell looked back at Macklin. \"Where did his wife get to, Colonel? I don't think that even previously he made too many personal decisions for himself. Perhaps she could influence him.\"\n \n \"Maybe,\" the colonel said. \"Let's find her.\"\n \n \n\n \n They found Mrs. Macklin in the dining room, her face at the picture window an attractive silhouette. She turned as the men approached.\n \n \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the colonel began, \"these gentlemen believe they can cure your husband of his present condition.\"\n \n \"Really?\" she said. \"Did you speak to Elliot about that?\"\n \n \"Y-yes,\" Colonel Carson said, \"but he's not himself. He refused the treatment. He wants to remain in his state of lower intelligence.\"\n \n She nodded. \"If those are his wishes, I can't go against them.\"\n \n \"But Mrs. Macklin!\" Mitchell protested. \"You will have to get a court order overruling your husband's wishes.\"\n \n She smoothed an eyebrow with the third finger of her right hand. \"That was my original thought. But I've redecided.\"\n \n \"Redecided!\" Carson burst out almost hysterically.\n \n \"Yes. I can't go against Elliot's wishes. It would be monstrous to put him back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again, where he never had a moment's peace from worry and pressure. He's happy now. Like a child, but happy.\"\n \n \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the Army man said levelly, \"if you don't help us restore your husband's mind we will be forced to get a court order declaring him incompetent.\"\n \n \"But he is not! Legally, I mean,\" the woman stormed.\n \n \"Maybe not. It's a borderline case. But I think any court would give us the edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once he's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and Ferris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin to sanity.\"\n \n \"I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,\" she said.\n \n The colonel looked smug. \"Why not?\"\n \n \"Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is involved.\"\n \n \"There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But—\"\n \n \"It isn't quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of vascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to give those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To paralyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority.\"\n \n \"I suppose there's some chance of that. But without the treatment there is no chance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell interjected.\n \n Her mouth grew petulant. \"I don't care. I would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him comfortable....\"\n \n Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led him back into the hall.\n \n \"I'm no psychiatrist,\" Mitchell said, \"but I think she wants Macklin stupid. Prefers it that way. She's always dominated his personal life, and now she can dominate him completely.\"\n \n \"What is she? A monster?\" the Army officer muttered.\n \n \"No,\" Mitchell said. \"She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous of her husband's genius.\"\n \n \"Maybe,\" Carson said. \"I don't know. I don't know what the hell to tell the Pentagon. I think I'll go out and get drunk.\"\n \n \"I'll go with you,\" Ferris said.\n \n Mitchell glanced sharply at the little biologist.\n \n Carson squinted. \"Any particular reason, doctor?\"\n \n \"To celebrate,\" Ferris said.\n \n The colonel shrugged. \"That's as good a reason as any.\"\n \n On the street, Mitchell watched the two men go off together in bewilderment.\n \n \n\n IV\n \n Macklin was playing jacks.\n \n He didn't have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a great curving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Pluto and the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Not his head. Mitchell's. Both heads were initialed \"M\" so it was all the same.\n \n \n\n \n Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.\n \n He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his heart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from the nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.\n \n After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.\n \n \"Hello?\" Elliot Macklin said.\n \n Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the phone instead of his wife.\n \n \"Can you speak freely, doctor?\" Mitchell asked.\n \n \"Of course,\" the mathematician said. \"I can talk fine.\"\n \n \"I mean, are you alone?\"\n \n \"Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she's asleep. That Army doctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn't let him give me anything, though.\"\n \n \"Good boy,\" the biologist said. \"Listen, doctor—Elliot—El, old son. I'm not against you like all the others. I don't want to make you go back to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me, don't you?\"\n \n There was a slight hesitation.\n \n \"Sure,\" Macklin said, \"if you say so. Why shouldn't I believe you?\"\n \n \"But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second if I could have some reason for not telling you the truth.\"\n \n \"I suppose so,\" Macklin said humbly.\n \n \"You've found yourself worrying—thinking—about a lot of other problems since we left you, haven't you? Maybe not the same kind of scientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn't used to have time to think about.\"\n \n \"If you say so.\"\n \n \"Now, you know it's so. But how would you like to get rid of those worries just as you got rid of the others?\" Mitchell asked.\n \n \"I guess I'd like that,\" the mathematician replied.\n \n \"Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it's at, don't you?\"\n \n \"No, I—yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won't try to put me back where I was instead of helping me more?\"\n \n \"I couldn't do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!\"\n \n \"If you say so. But I don't guess I can come anyway. The Army is watching me pretty close.\"\n \n \"That's alright,\" Mitchell said quickly. \"You can bring along Colonel Carson.\"\n \n \"But he won't like you fixing me up more.\"\n \n \"But he can't stop me! Not if you want me to do it. Now listen to me—I want you to come right on over here, El.\"\n \n \"If you say so,\" Macklin said uncertainly.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "26e0391c309243e8b3c8bf848e98419e", "response_text": "Ferris and Mitchell discuss the struggles they are experiencing with their research. They are eager to test their new research and want the test subject to be Elliot Macklin, a well-known and attractive scientist with a reputation akin to Albert Einstein. Macklin experiences migraines and the two believe that their injection shot could cure them. The two want Macklin to participate because it could ensure that their research will have strong financial support.\n\nMacklin soon enters their laboratory and begins to ask about what they’re looking to do with their research. Ferris and Mitchell discuss their theory with Macklin and how their supposed cure works. They mention to Macklin, to his dismay, that it has only been tested on animals. Macklin is skeptical and considers the injection too risky and initially does not agree to take the treatment. \n\nMacklin begins to start experiencing a migraine. As he suffers through a migraine, Ferris and Mitchell use the opportunity to try again to convince him to participate in the research. They further emphasize the very minimal potential risk. Macklin finally agrees to take the injection due to the immense pain he is experiencing. \n\nLater on, Mitchell is upset with Ferris for sharing their unverified results with the press. Ferris exclaims to Mitchell that the experiment with Macklin was a success and that he should not be concerned. The phone rings and Ferris answers it but quickly passes it to Mitchell. Macklin’s wife is on the phone accusing them of giving her husband heroin as Macklin appears to be in a trance. The doctors are concerned by the news and decide to check on the test animals. They do not find anything of concern with the test animals and go to Macklin’s house. Ferris does not seem worried to Mitchell as they wait to be let into the house. When they enter the house, an army Colonel meets them and expresses his unhappiness with their actions. \n\nAs the group heads into the living room, they greet an army physician that tells them that medically there is nothing wrong with Macklin’s health the only difference is that Macklin is no longer a mathematical genius. The three go into the hallway and discuss how the experiment most likely went wrong. The Colonel becomes upset because Macklin was very important to many missions because of his invaluable research. Mitchell suddenly exclaims that he thinks that Macklin can be cured. \n\nHowever, Macklin overhears the possibility of a cure and protests receiving the treatment. The Colonel is upset at Macklin’s reaction and tries to convince Macklin’s wife to force him to be cured. Macklin’s wife does not wish to go against her husband’s wishes. They leave the house without convincing Macklin or his wife. Later on, Mitchell wakes up and calls Macklin.

Their new injection that they have discovered will potentially cure Macklin of his incessant migraines, which plague the genius' daily life. Macklin is famed for being at the forefront of the research team that is almost finished developing a faster than light drive, to help the US army reach Pluto. The only thing in the way of the completion of this project could be Macklin's headaches. Mitchell and Ferris ask Macklin if he would like to be the trial patient for their new antidote, which they only have funding to test out on one person. The antidote consists of a virus that is injected into a specific spot in the brain, blocking off oxygen from entering, curing the patient of any headaches. After walking Macklin through the science behind it and Macklin signing some waivers, they deliver the treatment to him. \nThe next day, Ferris gives the story of their success with the Doctor to the newspapers, that is until they get a call form Macklin's wife. She tells him that her husband seems to be high on a form of heroin. To this the two scientists protest, but then go to check on their previous animal test subjects to see their state. All the animals tested appear fine, yet subdued. They decide to go and check up on Macklin. \nThey arrive at his house to meet a colonel at the door, who invites them into the living room, where Macklin is sitting. He has just been evaluated by the doctor, and it turns out that the vaccine has reduced his brain capacity, to the point where he is now a \"moron\". The oxygen that the brain has been denied has made Macklin stupid, almost childlike. The two scientists propose they can fix this quite easily, and they just need to reverse the treatment they gave him, which would return him to his original state. Both Macklin and his wife refuse this. Macklin wants to live a life without pain, and the thoughts about the universe that would keep him up worrying, late at night. His wife tells the men that she doesn't want to go against her husband's wishes, and if the US government wants to take the pair to court over it, so that Macklin might regain full consciousness and continue with his work on the Pluto project, the court would side in her and her husband's favour. \nThe men leave, defeated. That is until Mitchell wakes up in the middle of the night, and calls Macklin, convincing him that it's in his best interest to come to his lab, so that he might make him better.

While Ferris suggests Mitchell to be the candidate, Mitchell points out that it wouldn’t be ethical. He suggests that Elliot Macklin, the late Albert Einstein, has more reputation and his migraine is well known. He is the perfect candidate they have. After a knock on the door, Mitchell and Ferris invite Macklin inside. They introduce the injection and claim that his headache can be cured forever with this one simple injection. Macklin notices that they have not yet tested this on a human being, but they assert that it worked fine on rats and chimps. They explain their situation to Macklin, which is a lack of time and money. They have the resources to cure one person. However, Macklin is still suspicious of the injection. Mitchell and Ferris assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low enough blood pressure to stop the heart. Along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject. \n\nMacklin’s wife calls and blames them for giving her husband heroin. Being confused, Mitchell and Ferris look at the test animals and realize that the ones with injections are much more calmer and have less energy. They go to see Macklin. Macklin has become the healthiest, happiest person, but he also becomes a moron, namely not very intelligent. After Mitchell explains that he has the antitoxin to fix him, Carson demands them to give it to Macklin. However, Macklin refuses. He used to be worried all the time, but now he is peaceful. Since he is legally responsible, he can definitely refuse the antitoxin. Thus, they go to Mrs. Macklin, hoping that she will be able to persuade Macklin to take the antitoxin. She also refuses. Later, Mitchell calls Macklin pointing out that he is still doing a lot of thinking. Mitchell tells him that he can get rid of them if he wants.

They want to test their cure on Elliot Macklin, a well-known genius mathematician who suffered from a stroke and is victim to periodic migraines. Macklin arrives, and the two inform him of their plan. They want to create a cure to the headache using an injection of a virus that attacks pituitrin, which causes migraines. They have had no confirmation of success of their cure on humans, only animals, so there is uncertainty with their experiment. Macklin initially tells them that there is too much of a risk, and that too many people rely on him for him to take the risk. However, after some consideration, Macklin agrees to take the injection. Later on, Mitchell scolds Ferris after learning that he had released the story to the press, despite the results not being confirmed yet. They then receive a call from Macklin's wife, hsyterically accusing them of giving Macklin narcotics and claiming that he has been put under a trance. Ferris and Mitchell visit Macklin, where they meet a team of Army doctors and officials, and find Macklin to be in a mellow, relaxed state.

The First Vice-President was a cool cat—the elevator and the money operators all wore earmuffs—was just as phony as a three-dollar bill!\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n I\n \n The First Vice-President of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company, the gentleman to whom Miss Orison McCall was applying for a job, was not at all the public picture of a banker. His suit of hound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his jacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious bank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really swing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you come on real cool in the secretary-bit.\"\n \n \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from staring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair of furry green earmuffs. It was not cold.\n \n Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color bread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked.\n \n \"Beg pardon?\"\n \n \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and down on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.\n \n \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said.\n \n \"You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n\"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay?\" He caught Orison's look of bewilderment. \"One each, a Franklin and a Grant,\" he explained further. She still looked blank. \"Sister, you gonna work in a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's a hunnerd-fifty a week, doll.\"\n \n \"That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji,\" Orison said. It was indeed.\n \n \"Crazy!\" Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it with athletic vigor. \"You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell you, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around this tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of elevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly to Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal than Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\" Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n\"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor and floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron Curtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs, now that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n \n The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to hold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and a microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\n\"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n \n \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\n \n The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\n\"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you get done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to read. Okay?\"\n \n \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a secretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me with the Bank's operation?\"\n \n \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that there paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to ask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union, coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take care of these details now? Or would you—\"\n \n \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems best to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's might explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's secretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall, girl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket, unfolded it to discover the day's Wall Street Journal , and began at the top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk, nodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said.\n\"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\"\n \n Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the one into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then took off upstairs in the elevator.\n \n \n\n \n By lunchtime Orison had finished the Wall Street Journal and had begun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a fantastic novel of some sort, named The Hobbit . Reading this peculiar fare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than ever that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her, the front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a Federal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a microphone for an invisible audience.\n \n Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the book and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was a new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming down from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with briefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these gentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped aboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his heart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment of their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny into this curiousest of banks.\n \n Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude. Girls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together, eyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and favored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed, finished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her lonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished the book, reading rapidly and becoming despite herself engrossed in the saga of Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. She switched off the microphone, put on her light coat, and rode downstairs in an elevator filled with earmuffed, silent, hat-clasping gentlemen.\n \n What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a double Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of the U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association. Earmuffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read into a microphone. A Vice-President with the vocabulary of a racetrack tout. And what goes on in those upper floors? Orison stopped in at the restaurant nearest her apartment house—the Windsor Arms—and ordered a meal and a single Martini. Her boss in Washington had told her that this job of hers, spying on Taft Bank from within, might prove dangerous. Indeed it was, she thought. She was in danger of becoming a solitary drinker.\n \n Home in her apartment, Orison set the notes of her first day's observations in order. Presumably Washington would call tonight for her initial report. Item: some of the men at the Bank wore earmuffs, several didn't. Item: the Vice-President's name was Mr. Wanji: Oriental? Item: the top eight floors of the Taft Bank Building seemed to be off-limits to all personnel not wearing earmuffs. Item: she was being employed at a very respectable salary to read newsprint and nonsense into a microphone. Let Washington make sense of that, she thought.\n \n \n\n \n In a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven o'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results of her first day's spying.\n \n No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock was set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her? Perhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs had her phone tapped.\n \n \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n \n Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she said.\n \n \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one. Do you read me? Over.\"\n \n Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax, she reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n \n The room was empty.\n \n \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n \n \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience. Who are you?\"\n \n \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you have anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n \n \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n \n \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly to your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n \n Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n \n \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow beside her.\n \n Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she asked.\n \n \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications security. Have you anything to report?\"\n \n \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the time?\"\n \n \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we establish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time, every day?\"\n \n \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n \n \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n \n Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a microphone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n \n \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped into a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n \n \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n \n \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with a peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she placed the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n \n Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved to write Washington for permission to make her future reports by registered mail.\n \n \n\n II\n \n At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current Wall Street Journal , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair of leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together was bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not wearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am President of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our little family.\"\n \n \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight? So tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three? Maybe higher heels?\n \n \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took the chair to the right of her desk.\n \n \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n \n \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n \n \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any reasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n \n \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled, as though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official designation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're to keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here and dictate it?\"\n \n \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and presence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n \n \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding asked, as though following her train of thought.\n \n \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large financial organization.\"\n \n \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used to them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense with calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy your using it.\"\n \n \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n \n \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this evening?\"\n \n Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and still so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n \n \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n \n \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march, playing, from the elevator.\n \n \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your personnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle, and bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European. Sandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a curtsy? Orison wondered.\n \n \"Thank you,\" she said.\n \n He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders stayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome, to the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink, saw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but not their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them. Small bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\n \n \n\n \n Orison finished the Wall Street Journal by early afternoon. A page came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of yesterday's Congressional Record . She launched into the Record , thinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome madman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. \"You read so well , darling,\" someone said across the desk.\n \n Orison looked up. \"Oh, hello,\" she said. \"I didn't hear you come up.\"\n \n \"I walk ever so lightly,\" the woman said, standing hip-shot in front of the desk, \"and pounce ever so hard.\" She smiled. Opulent, Orison thought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don't like her. Can't. Wouldn't if I could. Never cared for cats.\n \n \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing teeth.\n \n \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I'm Auga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\"\n \n \"Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?\"\n \n \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan't have time to visit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker. One for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\"\n \n \"Thanks,\" Orison said.\n \n \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I'd like to draw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding—you know, the shoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Should you throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your little eyes scratched out. Word to the wise, n'est-ce pas ?\"\n \n \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her Wall Street Journal into a club and standing. \"Darling.\"\n \n \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here. You could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of annoyance. Understand me, darling?\"\n \n \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you'd best hurry back to your stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.\"\n \n \"Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right off?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator, displaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba motion.\n \n The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male, stepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing.\n \n \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed, he stepped up to Orison's desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said.\n \n \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused and shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It's just that ... Vingt thing....\"\n \n \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said.\n \n \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\"\n \n \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I'm Kraft Gerding, Dink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped even closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch of frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The head, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's spike-topped Pickelhauben ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed normal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed—what continental manners these bankers had!—and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up paper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.\n \n \n\n \n Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and said, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you, Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing business with pleasure.\"\n \n Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she shouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I care. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in finance, and listen to another word.\"\n \n \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again, a bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most charming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end, dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to the wise....\"\n \n \" N'est-ce pas? \" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here's a word to the foolish. Get lost.\"\n \n Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\"\n \n \"I'll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind you. Push a button, will you? And bon voyage .\"\n \n Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with a cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above fifth floor.\n \n First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding. Surely, Orison thought, recovering the Wall Street Journal from her wastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern bank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior of the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she thought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks and all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she finished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits upper floors.\n \n Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the sudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \" Wanji e-Kal, Datto. Dink ger-Dink d'summa. \"\n \n Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before replying, \"I'm a local girl. Try me in English.\"\n \n \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I'm in kinda clutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see him, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\"\n \n \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down. What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language Mr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by tonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle it out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk, she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could only fire her.\n \n Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would be here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going. The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her off the upstairs floors.\n \n But the building had a stairway.\n \n \n\n III\n \n The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to seven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and the landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There was a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the fringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\n \n She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\n \n Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room extended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut, its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were galvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs. Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred and eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by strands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with pink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half full of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment Orison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the liquid. Then she screamed.\n \n \n\n \n The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from the spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions upon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling, leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison put her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the stairway door.\n \n Into a pair of arms.\n \n \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said. Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have her wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder Gerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he said. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were we to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against her two sumo -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by some quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the floor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted all around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of course, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of calcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within minutes.\"\n \n \"Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of the earmuffed sumo -wrestlers protested.\n \n \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you must tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.\"\n \n \"Dink ... Dink!\" Orison shouted.\n \n \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of damsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the bank.\"\n \n \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you acromegalic apes!\"\n \n \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded.\n \n \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\"\n \n \n\n \n Suddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as though struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their faces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly lowering himself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Without questions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms around Orison.\n \n \"They can't harm you,\" he said. She turned to press her face against his chest. \"You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn your brain back on. All right, now?\"\n \n \"All right,\" she said, still trembling. \"They were going to throw me to the spiders.\"\n \n \"Kraft told you that?\" Dink Gerding released her and turned to the kneeling man. \"Stand up, Elder Brother.\"\n \n \"I....\"\n \n Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft's jaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.\n \n \"If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt to recover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.\" Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dink through half-closed eyes. \"No? Then get out of here, all of you. Samma! \"\n \n Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, with the merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.\n \n \"I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison,\" Dink said. \"Why did you do it?\"\n \n \"Have you read the story of Bluebeard?\" Orison asked. She stood close to Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. \"I had to see what it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was forbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for you, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you that the escudo green is pale.\"\n \n \"You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless,\" Dink said. \"Now, what is this thing you have about spiders?\"\n \n \"I've always been terrified of them,\" Orison said. \"When I was a little girl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a spider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came home and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetite for supper.\"\n \n \"Strange,\" Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked one of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. \"This is no spider, Orison,\" he said.\n \n She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped in the palm of his hand. \"These are Microfabridae, more nearly related to shellfish than to spiders,\" he said. \"They're stone-and-metal eaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.\" He extended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature, flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around the bowl of his hand. \"Pretty little fellow, isn't he?\" Dink asked.\n\"Here. You hold him.\"\n \n \"I'd rather not,\" she protested.\n \n \"I'd be happier if you did,\" Dink said.\n \n \n\n \n Orison extended her hand as into a furnace. Dink brushed the Microfabridus from his palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like a legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and unfolded it, to hold it over Orison's palm.\n \n \"He's like a baby crawdad,\" Orison said.\n \n \"A sort of crustacean,\" Dink agreed. \"We use them in a commercial process we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off and secret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.\"\n \n \"What do they do?\" Orison asked.\n \n \"That's still a secret,\" Dink said, smiling. \"I can't tell even you that, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.\"\n \n \"What's he doing now?\" Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus, perched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching against her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.\n \n \"They like gold,\" Dink explained, peering across her shoulder, comfortably close. \"They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as children are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison. We'd better get you down where you belong.\"\n \n Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest tank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring. It was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. \"Strange, using crawdads in a bank,\" she said. She stood silent for a moment. \"I thought I heard music,\" she said. \"I heard it when I came in. Something like the sighing of wind in winter trees.\"\n \n \"That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing together while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He took her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these little workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\"\n \n Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to the music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness, storm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace and harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.\n\"It's an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been singing it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a wood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.\n\"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.\n\"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said.\n \n Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the mineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the liquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.\n\"They're so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she thought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling life. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "af155caa61514dd9b3bfe0a82a06500f", "response_text": "Orison McCall is applying for a job at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company.

Orison notes that their singing sounds like the sighing of the wind in winter trees. When she listens to them sing again, it sounds like wilderness, storm, and danger.

He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder, crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\n \n \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the wire as the scrambler went into operation.\n \n \"Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this damned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest of the afternoon.\"\n \n \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered hum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond—I can't wait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing me.\"\n \n \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got some answers to go with the questions?\"\n \n \"I'm an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind that. This fellow Margrave—General Margrave. Project Officer for the hyperwave program—he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau—\"\n \n \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all. Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let me do it my way.\"\n \n \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home area—\"\n \n \"You don't have to justify yourself. Just don't hold out on me. I sometimes wonder if I've seen the complete files on this—\"\n \n \"You've seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I'm warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!\"\n \n \n\n \n Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the opposite corner of his mouth.\n \n \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of authority.\n \n Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while, though.\"\n \n The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What brings you back to the boondocks?\"\n \n \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\n \n In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\"\n \n Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n \n \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n \n \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction pattern—\"\n \n \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your word for it.\"\n \n \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\n \n \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord intended.\"\n \n \"I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had something ...\"\n \n \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there's always Mr. Bram ...\"\n \n \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a hundred years old when I was kid.\"\n \n \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\n \n \"Well, what about him?\"\n \n \"Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little touched in the head.\"\n \n \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine said. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something I've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me. I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and sometimes he gave us apples.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"I've never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this town is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram has blue eyes and blond hair—or did before it turned white—and he talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right. But we never did know where he came from.\"\n \n \"How long's he lived here in Elsby?\"\n \n \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about ancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\n \n \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened then?\"\n \n \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all over again.\"\n \n \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the other drug store....\"\n \n \"Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it on fire.\"\n \n \"What was the idea of that?\"\n \n \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back in the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day they'll make jail age.\"\n \n \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any dealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\n \n \"Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew about Mr. Bram—the young Mr. Bram—and Linda Carroll.\"\n \n Tremaine shook his head.\n \n \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper. Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to think she was some kind of princess....\"\n \n \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\"\n \n \n\n \n Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling, frowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties—and that made her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair—and a stranger to boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town, practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy shay. And the next day, she was home again—alone. That finished off her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram in front of her.\"\n \n Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess. Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n \n \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of detector you were going to set up?\"\n \n \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up in my room over at the hotel.\"\n \n \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n \n \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely repeating logarithmic sequence, based on—\"\n \n \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me know if you want anything. And by the way—\" he winked broadly—\"I always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front teeth.\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor, a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said\n\"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n \n A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at Tremaine.\n \n \"We're closed,\" he said.\n \n \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the Bram property changed hands last.\"\n \n The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram? He dead?\"\n \n \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n \n The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to sell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n \n \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n \n The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n \n Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw. A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n \n \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n \n It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a line written in faded ink:\n \n \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&V consid. NW Quarter Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 & cet.)\"\n \n \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n \n \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n \n \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to the door.\n \n \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of trouble?\"\n \n \"No. No trouble.\"\n \n The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\" he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n \n \"I guess you're right.\"\n \n The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n \n \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n \n \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.\n\"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n \n Tremaine waited.\n \n \"You—uh—paying anything for information?\"\n \n \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n \n The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway—I can swear to this. Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\"\n \n \n\n \n Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n \n \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The older are there in the shelves.\"\n \n \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n \n The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle these old papers carefully.\"\n \n \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed through it, muttering.\n \n \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n \n \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n \n The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table, adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n \n \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech. Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n \n On page four, under a column headed County Notes he saw the name Bram:\n \n Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land, north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past months.\n \n \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n \n The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught his eye:\n \n A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along the river.\n \n The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now. You'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n \n Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n \n A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped short, stared after the car.\n \n \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply. Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed north after the police car.\n \n \n\n \n Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back. The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n \n \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n \n \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\"\n \n \"What's it to you, mister?\"\n \n \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\n \n \"We could be.\"\n \n \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\"\n \n \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike before handing it to Tremaine.\n \n The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef, Tremaine?\"\n \n \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave the word, Grammond.\"\n \n \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out on me.\"\n \n \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\"\n \n Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it apart brick by brick in the time—\"\n \n \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll go underground.\"\n \n \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use for the spade work, that it?\"\n \n \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\"\n \n \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county—\"\n \n \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\n \n Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\"\n \n \n\n \n Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\n \n \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred. Tell him if he queers this—\"\n \n \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out—\"\n \n \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia moonshiners.\"\n \n \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\"\n \n \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat and left the hotel.\n \n He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned face looked at him coolly.\n \n \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I—\"\n \n \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto. Only a faint quaver reflected her age—close to eighty, Tremaine thought, startled.\n \n \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\n \n \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a straight chair across the room from him.\n \n \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see that you've amounted to something.\"\n \n \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\"\n \n \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\n \n \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\n \n \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\n \n \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your discretion?\"\n \n \"Of course.\"\n \n \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\"\n \n \n\n \n Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be used against him?\"\n \n \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs to be in the national interest.\"\n \n \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means, James. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n \n \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n \n \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the year.\"\n \n \"What does he do for a living?\"\n \n \"I have no idea.\"\n \n \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated piece of country? What's his story?\"\n \n \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n \n \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his last?\"\n \n \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n \n \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything—\"\n \n A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away impatiently.\n \n \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n \n Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n \n Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\" She paused. Tremaine waited.\n \n \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale. He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in a cave beneath his house.\"\n \n Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me there alone.\n \n \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried to speak to me but I would not listen.\n \n \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home. He never called again.\"\n \n \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n \n Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I am, James.\"\n \n \"May I see it?\"\n \n She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n \n Miss Carroll nodded.\n \n \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n \n \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n \n \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n \n \n\n III\n \n As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and asked:\n \n \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n \n Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a dud, I'm afraid.\"\n \n \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n \n \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n \n As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand from what you were saying to me.\"\n \n \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n \n \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring working—\"\n \n \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ... and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n \n The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n \n He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a gun?\"\n \n \"In the car.\"\n \n \"Better get it.\"\n \n Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket, rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate lay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n \n \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n \n \"Not a very cozy—\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the distance.\n \n \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n \n A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\" Tremaine said.\n \n Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n \n \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n \n \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n \n \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor. It ended suddenly near the wall.\n \n \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n \n A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess stared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\" he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing tricks?\"\n \n \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few questions.\"\n \n \n\n \n At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop of greased hair.\n \n \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n \n \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong with burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n \n \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that out, Hull?\"\n \n \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we heard....\"\n \n \"What did you hear?\"\n \n \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n \n \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n \n \"Cops.\"\n \n \"Who says so?\"\n \n The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n \n \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all night.\"\n \n \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around hers.\"\n \n \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\n \n The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out that way, ain't he?\"\n \n \"Anything else?\"\n \n The boy looked at his feet.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "103", "uid": "ca6954aa341f44a4ad84599dcfa6aa19", "response_text": "With pressure coming from Fred, who elected him into this investigation, Tremaine first goes to the police station to meet his friend who works here so that he can get familiar with the town and learn about unusual activities and strange events if there are any.

Tremaine enters a pleasant parlor with old furniture. Jess picks him up and they drive to Mr. Bram's house. The place looks dark and dangerous, it looks as if it was empty for a week or so.

LOMBINO\n \n There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel Walsh's madness—murder-madness—when he ordered Major Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since we went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\n \n For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus. He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as I liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At least, that's what he told me.\n \n I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were somewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in Space II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of it, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and then. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get by with gravy.\n \n \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over his fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n \n \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\n \n I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on the job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his fingers.\n \n \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then added, \"For a native, that is.\"\n \n I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the way he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there. Which brought to mind an important point.\n \n \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I thought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\n \n He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk as if he were waiting for me to cut.\n \n \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so happens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just what's happening on Mars.\"\n \n I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very far.\n \n \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If anyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\n \n If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give them to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called it \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at least a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\n \n \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never been to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It was just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\n \n \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\n \n At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported him for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium that could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night. He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by reporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in any military organization, he outranked me.\n \n \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n \n \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n \n \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n \n \"Just Joe.\"\n \n \"Just Joe?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than first names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n \n \"I don't know, sir.\"\n \n \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n \n \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance? Personal habits? Anything?\"\n \n Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like any of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He does have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n \n \"What's that?\"\n \n \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n \n I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n \n \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\"\n \n \n\n \n The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on that trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought about Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that revolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started pushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if the whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took over. Swell guy, Walsh.\n \n Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic I was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like a mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere I looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd never seen before, and some as bare as cactus.\n \n I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me about. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about him was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have been stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to normal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.\n \n I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called.\n \n He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance between us in seconds.\n \n \"Call me Joe,\" he said.\n \n I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this was going to be a simple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said.\n \n \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered.\n \n \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told him.\n \n \"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at his use of Terran idiom.\n \n \"You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?\"\n \n \"I'm Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a pocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\"\n \n \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began wondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking for. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately upon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him anyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a drink first.\n \n \"Where's the Officer's Club?\" I asked the Venusian.\n \n \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\"\n \n \"Can you take me there?\" I asked.\n \n \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a heavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when he dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\"\n \n The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that protected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable but I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped the native thirty solars.\n \n He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh well, you're new here. We'll let it go.\"\n \n He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'd meant. Had I tipped him too little?\n \n I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it looked as hot as hell.\n \n On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to curse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.\n \n There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game and a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.\n \n I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\"\n \n \"Call me Joe,\" he answered.\n \n He caught me off balance. \"What?\"\n \n \"Joe,\" he said again.\n \n A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.\n\"You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about Mars, would you?\"\n \n \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\"\n \n That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....\n  But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\n \n \n Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most contemptible....\n \n \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again.\n \n \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain's shack?\"\n \n \"Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.\"\n \n I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at the bartender.\n \n \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How's it going?\"\n \n \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied.\n \n I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a great gag. Very funny. Very....\n \n \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who'd just come in asked.\n \n \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.\n \n \"You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,\" he said. \"He's about ready to post you as overdue.\"\n \n \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\"\n \n \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.\n \n \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender.\n \n \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back.\n \n \n\n \n Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing a tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did an officer.\n \n \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the desk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it was empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped open. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n \n \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n \n \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us some, please?\"\n \n \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the door behind him.\n  Another Joe , I thought. Another damned Joe.\n \n \n \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n \n \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n \n \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things they like about Terran culture.\"\n \n So Walsh had taken care of that angle too. He does have a peculiar habit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes. Cigarettes was the tip I should have given; not solars.\n \n \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n \n Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n \n \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but I think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n \n Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it was so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and waited for his explanation.\n \n \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n \n \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n \n \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you know. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n \n \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n \n \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture. Lots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n \n I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful ancestry more keenly.\n \n \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\" Bransten was saying.\n \n I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh sitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n \n \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n \n \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain wasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how they are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him Joe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you like to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n \n \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n \n \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives are a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them—the Joe business, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the cigarettes.\"\n \n He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were personally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if he were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first place.\n \n \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n \n Just a case of extended idiot , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose chase a hell of a long way from home.\n \n \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n \n Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding me that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first Venusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n \n I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton stuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical tunic.\n \n I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort of thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I twinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n \n Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat pussy cat.\n \n \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n \n \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n \n Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any difficulties, are you?\"\n \n \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him a lot sooner if....\"\n \n \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n \n \"I thought....\"\n \n \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you otherwise.\"\n \n Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n \n \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n \n I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those big white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the surprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles away.\n \n He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on him.\n \n \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n \n I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen on my end went blank, too.\n  He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n \n \n I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my quarters.\n \n As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n \n One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping the next ship back to Earth.\n \n It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer. It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the Service altogether.\n \n Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that jungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a trader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of course, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might really find a guy who was trader Joe.\n \n I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and besides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his life. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there was I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n \n I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n \n A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n \n \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n \n \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n \n \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me into the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n \n \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n \n \"How much?\"\n \n \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n \n \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n \n \"How's the price sound?\"\n \n \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were almost a childish people!\n \n \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the planet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do. Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n \n \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up around fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n \n The Venusian started to leave.\n \n \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not overlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n \n His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n \n When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd just have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on a planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the Captain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n \n \n\n \n I began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of me. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed like a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something that had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I'd be back again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set for me.\n \n Or maybe he didn't expect me to come back.\n \n The thought hadn't occurred to me before this, and I began to consider it seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing at the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a few more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with Space II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken place like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too. But what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in command. If he were transferred, I'd be in charge of Space II, and I could understand how much that would appeal to Walsh.\n \n I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good points against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A guy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of uranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn't watched, would deliberately do just about anything.\n \n Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may have been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a gag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in.\n \n The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall, elongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far.\n \n \"I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,\" he said.\n \n \"Are you familiar with the jungle?\" I asked him.\n \n \"Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.\"\n \n \"Has Joe told you what the payment will be?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.\"\n \n I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled.\n \n \"When can we leave?\"\n \n \"Right away, sir. We won't need much really. I've made a list of supplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear light clothing, boots, and a hat.\"\n \n \"Will I need a weapon?\"\n \n He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. \"Why, what for, sir?\"\n \n \"Never mind,\" I said. \"What's your name, by the way?\"\n \n He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was definitely surprised.\n \n \"Joe,\" he said. \"Didn't you know?\"\n \n \n\n \n When we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the boots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it would have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the high boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n \n Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be enjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret pleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't see three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes, his head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another. Then he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more impenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly to another village.\n \n Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their huts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took me a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n \n Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of stinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had I any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low about the whole affair.\n \n Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each village he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped gossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye to all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n \n His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing that would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He would talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n \n \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n \n \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n \n \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good for Venus. And they are fun.\"\n \n \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species Leonard Walsh.\n \n \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ... well, you know.\"\n \n \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n \n Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more, that I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been just my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and employee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere began to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about the people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid tests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding sympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n \n And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely friendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our grinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n \n Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted greenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife gleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled vines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing through them like strips of silk.\n \n \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n \n \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n \n I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n \n \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n \n \"We'll never find him.\"\n \n \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n \n \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n \n \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n \n I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a brilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same feeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my friends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my own house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe reminded me of that friend.\n \n \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large now, his eyes shining.\n \n \n\n \n Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out to greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n \n \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n \n He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n \n And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of the sun like a great silver bullet.\n \n \"What...?\" I started.\n \n \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n \n The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near the nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh standing near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n \n \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look cheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n \n \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his joviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n \n Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with happiness.\n \n \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n \n I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he was getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n \n I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n \n \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel, Major .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless finality.\n \n I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd been. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh pointing the stun gun at my middle.\n \n \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n \n \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure have.\"\n \n Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the smile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm going to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think it'll rain tomorrow.\"\n \n Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying this. Another of those funny Terran games.\n \n \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I should thank you, really.\"\n \n \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n \n \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n \n \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing when you decided to cork off.\"\n \n Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n \n \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n \n \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have nudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again sometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n \n Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely audible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this little spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small, unimportant drama.\n \n I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n \n \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n \n \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n \n \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n \n Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't understand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the game, the fun?\n \n \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was never any trouble before you took command.\"\n \n \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n \n Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to say about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native. Or maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n \n \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n \n \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n \n \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with savages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe. The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the colonel in puzzlement.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "106", "uid": "e0294bdceda64c64aa14173c25a683d8", "response_text": "Major Polk is given orders by his Boss, Colonel Walsh, to go to Venus in search of a man named Joe.

We supply cheap. Trouble also handled without charge.\" Interplanetary Hauling Company. (ADVT.)\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Bob Parker, looking through the photo-amplifiers at the wedge-shaped asteroid, was plainly flabbergasted. Not in his wildest imaginings had he thought they would actually find what they were looking for.\n \n \"Cut the drive!\" he yelled at Queazy. \"I've got it, right on the nose. Queazy, my boy, can you imagine it? We're in the dough. Not only that, we're rich! Come here!\"\n \n Queazy discharged their tremendous inertia into the motive-tubes in such a manner that the big, powerful ship was moving at the same rate as the asteroid below—47.05 miles per second. He came slogging back excitedly, put his eyes to the eyepiece. He gasped, and his big body shook with joyful ejaculations.\n \n \"She checks down to the last dimension,\" Bob chortled, working with slide-rule and logarithm tables. \"Now all we have to do is find out if she's made of tungsten, iron, quartz crystals, and cinnabar! But there couldn't be two asteroids of that shape anywhere else in the Belt, so this has to be it!\"\n \n He jerked a badly crumpled ethergram from his pocket, smoothed it out, and thumbed his nose at the signature.\n \n \"Whee! Mr. Andrew S. Burnside, you owe us five hundred and fifty thousand dollars!\"\n \n Queazy straightened. A slow, likeable smile wreathed his tanned face.\n\"Better take it easy,\" he advised, \"until I land the ship and we use the atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of the asteroid.\"\n \n \"Have it your way,\" Bob Parker sang, happily. He threw the ethergram to the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy—so called because his full name was Quentin Zuyler—dropped the ship straight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped it tight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, brought out two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, with star-powdered infinity spread to all sides.\n \n In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia, one of the richest men in the world, still lay on the deck-plates. It was addressed to: Mr. Robert Parker, President Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., 777 Main Street, Satterfield City, Fontanaland, Mars. The ethergram read:\n  Received your advertising literature a week ago. Would like to state that yes I would like an asteroid in my back yard. Must meet following specifications: 506 feet length, long enough for wedding procession;\n98 feet at base, tapering to 10 feet at apex; 9-12 feet thick; topside smooth-plane, underside rough-plane; composed of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar. Must be in my back yard before 11:30 A.M. my time, for important wedding June 2, else order is void. Will pay $5.00 per ton.\n \n \n \n\n \n Bob Parker had received that ethergram three weeks ago. And if The Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on the rocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor & Saylor, a rival firm) neither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answering ethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. It was, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chance there was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worries would be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, using their mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed like an incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions of asteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space only three weeks.\n \n The \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea had been Bob Parker's originally. Now it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the first rich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid. Unfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in on that brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers—which persons Bob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would have before this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants. Now that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate to get it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might get wind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits. Which was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor & Saylor made no pretense of being scrupulous.\n \n Now they scuffed along the smooth-plane topside of the asteroid, the magnets in their shoes keeping them from stepping off into space. They came to the broad base of the asteroid-wedge, walked over the edge and\n\"down\" the twelve-foot thickness. Here they squatted, and Bob Parker happily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface. By the naked eye, they could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar, but he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn't use it. He satisfied himself as to the exterior of the asteroid, and then sent the twin beams deep into its heart. The beams crossed, tore atoms from molecules, revolved them like an infinitely fine powder. The radiations from the sundered molecules traveled back up the beams to the atomic-whirl spectroscope. Bob watched a pointer which moved slowly up and up—past tungsten, past iridium, past gold—\n \n Bob Parker said, in astonishment, \"Hell! There's something screwy about this business. Look at that point—\"\n \n Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer any further. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,\n \n \"May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?\"\n \n Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred and the lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far as he could inside the \"aquarium\"—the glass helmet, and found himself looking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of the asteroid \"below.\"\n \n \"Ma'am,\" said Bob, blinking, \"did you say something?\"\n \n Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automatically reached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.\n \n \"I said,\" remarked the girl, \"that you should scram off of my asteroid. And quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already taken a reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.\"\n \n \n\n \n Bob's nose twitched as he adjusted his glasses, which he wore even inside his suit. He couldn't think of anything pertinent to say. He knew that he was slowly working up a blush. Mildly speaking, the girl was beautiful, and though only her carefully made-up face was visible—cool blue eyes, masterfully coiffed, upswept, glinting brown hair, wilful lips and chin—Bob suspected the rest of her compared nicely.\n \n Her expression darkened as she saw the completely instinctive way he was looking at her and her radioed-voice rapped out, \"Now you two boys go and play somewhere else! Else I'll let the Interplanetary Commission know you've infringed the law. G'bye!\"\n \n She turned and disappeared.\n \n Bob awoke from his trance, shouted desperately, \"Hey! Wait! You! \"\n \n He and Queazy caught up with her on the side of the asteroid they hadn't yet examined. It was a rough plane, completing the rigid qualifications Burnside had set down.\n \n \"Wait a minute,\" Bob Parker begged nervously. \"I want to make some conversation, lady. I'm sure you don't understand the conditions—\"\n \n The girl turned and drew a gun from a holster. It was a spasticizer, and it was three times as big as her gloved hand.\n \n \"I understand conditions better than you do,\" she said. \"You want to move this asteroid from its orbit and haul it back to Earth. Unfortunately, this is my home, by common law. Come back in a month. I don't expect to be here then.\"\n \n \"A month!\" Parker burst the word out. He started to sweat, then his face became grim. He took two slow steps toward the girl. She blinked and lost her composure and unconsciously backed up two steps. About twenty steps away was her small dumbbell-shaped ship, so shiny and unscarred that it reflected starlight in highlights from its curved surface. A rich girl's ship, Bob Parker thought angrily. A month would be too late!\n \n He said grimly, \"Don't worry. I don't intend to pull any rough stuff. I just want you to listen to reason. You've taken a whim to stay on an asteroid that doesn't mean anything to you one way or another. But to us—to me and Queazy here—it means our business. We got an order for this asteroid. Some screwball millionaire wants it for a backyard wedding see? We get five hundred and fifty thousand dollars for it! If we don't take this asteroid to Earth before June 2, we go back to Satterfield City and work the rest of our lives in the glass factories. Don't we, Queazy?\"\n \n Queazy said simply, \"That's right, miss. We're in a spot. I assure you we didn't expect to find someone living here.\"\n \n The girl holstered her spasticizer, but her completely inhospitable expression did not change. She put her hands on the bulging hips of her space-suit. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Now I understand the conditions. Now we both understand each other. G'bye again. I'm staying here and—\" she smiled sweetly \"—it may interest you to know that if I let you have the asteroid you'll save your business, but I'll meet a fate worse than death! So that's that.\"\n \n Bob recognized finality when he saw it. \"Come on, Queazy,\" he said fuming. \"Let this brat have her way. But if I ever run across her without a space-suit on I'm going to give her the licking of her life, right where it'll do the most good!\"\n \n He turned angrily, but Queazy grabbed his arm, his mouth falling open. He pointed off into space, beyond the girl.\n \n \"What's that?\" he whispered.\n \n \"What's wha— Oh! \"\n \n Bob Parker's stomach caved in. A few hundred feet away, floating gently toward the asteroid, came another ship—a ship a trifle bigger than their own. The girl turned, too. They heard her gasp. In another second, Bob was standing next to her. He turned the audio-switch to his headset off, and spoke to the girl by putting his helmet against hers.\n \n \"Listen to me, miss,\" he snapped earnestly, when she tried to draw away. \"Don't talk by radio. That ship belongs to the Saylor brothers! Oh, Lord, that this should happen! Somewhere along the line, we've been double-crossed. Those boys are after this asteroid too, and they won't hesitate to pull any rough stuff. We're in this together, understand? We got to back each other up.\"\n \n The girl nodded dumbly. Suddenly she seemed to be frightened.\n\"It's—it's very important that this—this asteroid stay right where it is,\" she said huskily. \"What—what will they do?\"\n \n \n\n \n Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue sparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic clamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and five men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood surveying the three who faced them.\n \n The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their darkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.\n \n \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you think of this situation Billy?\"\n \n \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his heels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have to take steps.\"\n \n The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling laughter.\n \n Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an ethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\"\n \n \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled—and his smile remained fixed, dangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came abreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave back a step, as he saw their intentions.\n \n \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll report you to the Interplanetary Commission!\"\n \n It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of these men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of the girl's spasticizer—a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained chance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at Queazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He hurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid and threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.\n \n At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his hand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked the smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something crushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar plexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back, and his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely, before the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete darkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage—then a scream of pain.\n \n What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick, he didn't care. Then—lights out.\n \n \n\n \n Bob Parker came to, the emptiness of remote starlight in his face. He opened his eyes. He was slowly revolving on an axis. Sometimes the Sun swept across his line of vision. A cold hammering began at the base of his skull, a sensation similar to that of being buried alive. There was no asteroid, no girl, no Queazy. He was alone in the vastness of space. Alone in a space-suit.\n \n \"Queazy!\" he whispered. \"Queazy! I'm running out of air!\"\n \n There was no answer from Queazy. With sick eyes, Bob studied the oxygen indicator. There was only five pounds pressure. Five pounds! That meant he had been floating around out here—how long? Days at least—maybe weeks! It was evident that somebody had given him a dose of spastic rays, enough to screw up every muscle in his body to the snapping point, putting him in such a condition of suspended animation that his oxygen needs were small. He closed his eyes, trying to fight against panic. He was glad he couldn't see any part of his body. He was probably scrawny. And he was hungry!\n \n \"I'll starve,\" he thought. \"Or suffocate to death first!\"\n \n He couldn't keep himself from taking in great gulps of air. Minutes, then hours passed. He was breathing abnormally, and there wasn't enough air in the first place. He pleaded continually for Queazy, hoping that somehow Queazy could help, when probably Queazy was in the same condition. He ripped out wild curses directed at the Saylor brothers. Murderers, both of them! Up until this time, he had merely thought of them as business rivals. If he ever got out of this—\n \n He groaned. He never would get out of it! After another hour, he was gasping weakly, and yellow spots danced in his eyes. He called Queazy's name once more, knowing that was the last time he would have strength to call it.\n \n And this time the headset spoke back!\n \n Bob Parker made a gurgling sound. A voice came again, washed with static, far away, burbling, but excited. Bob made a rattling sound in his throat. Then his eyes started to close, but he imagined that he saw a ship, shiny and small, driving toward him, growing in size against the backdrop of the Milky Way. He relapsed, a terrific buzzing in his ears.\n \n He did not lose consciousness. He heard voices, Queazy's and the girl's, whoever she was. Somebody grabbed hold of his foot. His\n\"aquarium\" was unbuckled and good air washed over his streaming face. The sudden rush of oxygen to his brain dizzied him. Then he was lying on a bunk, and gradually the world beyond his sick body focussed in his clearing eyes and he knew he was alive—and going to stay that way, for awhile anyway.\n \n \"Thanks, Queazy,\" he said huskily.\n \n Queazy was bending over him, his anxiety clearing away from his suddenly brightening face.\n \n \"Don't thank me,\" he whispered. \"We'd have both been goners if it hadn't been for her. The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed like us, and when she woke up she was on a slow orbit around her ship. She unstrapped her holster and threw it away from her and it gave her enough reaction to reach the ship. She got inside and used the direction-finder on the telaudio and located me first. The Saylors scattered us far and wide.\" Queazy's broad, normally good-humored face twisted blackly. \"The so and so's didn't care if we lived or died.\"\n \n Bob saw the girl now, standing a little behind Queazy, looking down at him curiously, but unhappily. Her space-suit was off. She was wearing lightly striped blue slacks and blue silk blouse and she had a paper flower in her hair. Something in Bob's stomach caved in as his eyes widened on her.\n \n The girl said glumly, \"I guess you men won't much care for me when you find out who I am and what I've done. I'm Starre Lowenthal—Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter!\"\n \n \n\n \n Bob came slowly to his feet, and matched Queazy's slowly growing anger.\n \n \"Say that again?\" he snapped. \"This is some kind of dirty trick you and your grandfather cooked up?\"\n \n \"No!\" she exclaimed. \"No. My grandfather didn't even know there was an asteroid like this. But I did, long before he ordered it from you—or from the Saylor brothers. You see—well, my granddad's about the stubbornest old hoot-owl in this universe! He's always had his way, and when people stand in his way, that's just a challenge to him. He's been badgering me for years to marry Mac, and so has Mac—\"\n \n \"Who's Mac?\" Queazy demanded.\n \n \"My fiancé, I guess,\" she said helplessly. \"He's one of my granddad's protégés. Granddad's always financing some likely young man and giving him a start in life. Mac has become pretty famous for his Mercurian water-colors—he's an artist. Well, I couldn't hold out any longer. If you knew my grandfather, you'd know how absolutely impossible it is to go against him when he's got his mind set! I was just a mass of nerves. So I decided to trick him and I came out to the asteroid belt and picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could take place on it. I took the measurements and the composition, then I told my grandfather I'd marry Mac if the wedding was in the back yard on top of an asteroid with those measurements and made of iron ore, tungsten, and so forth. He agreed so fast he scared me, and just to make sure that if somebody did find the asteroid in time they wouldn't be able to get it back to Earth, I came out here and decided to live here. Asteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them, by common law.... So I had everything figured out—except,\" she added bitterly, \"the Saylor brothers! I guess Granddad wanted to make sure the asteroid was delivered, so he gave the order to several companies.\"\n \n Bob swore under his breath. He went reeling across to a port, and was gratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floating only a few hundred feet away. He swung around, looked at Queazy.\n \n \"How long were we floating around out there?\"\n \n \"Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us a stiff shot.\"\n \n \" Ouch! \" Bob groaned. Then he looked at Starre Lowenthal with determination. \"Miss, pardon me if I say that this deal you and your granddad cooked up is plain screwy! With us on the butt end. But I'm going to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylor brothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship and ours both travel on the HH drive—inertia-less. But the asteroid has plenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by a long, spiraling orbit. We can go direct and probably catch up with them a few hundred thousand miles this side of Earth. And we can have a fling at getting the asteroid back!\"\n \n Her eyes sparkled. \"You mean—\" she cried. Then her attractive face fell. \"Oh,\" she said. \" Oh! And when you get it back, you'll land it.\"\n \n \"That's right,\" Bob said grimly. \"We're in business. For us, it's a matter of survival. If the by-product of delivering the asteroid is your marriage—sorry! But until we do get the asteroid back, we three can work as a team if you're willing. We'll fight the other problem out later. Okay?\"\n \n She smiled tremulously. \"Okay, I guess.\"\n \n Queazy looked from one to another of them. He waved his hand scornfully at Bob. \"You're plain nuts,\" he complained. \"How do you propose to go about convincing the Saylor brothers they ought to let us have the asteroid back? Remember, commercial ships aren't allowed to carry long-range weapons. And we couldn't ram the Saylor brothers' ship—not without damaging our own ship just as much. Go ahead and answer that.\"\n \n Bob looked at Queazy dismally. \"The old balance-wheel,\" he groaned at Starre. \"He's always pulling me up short when I go off half-cocked. All I know is, that maybe we'll get a good idea as we go along. In the meantime, Starre—ahem—none of us has eaten in three weeks...?\"\n \n Starre got the idea. She smiled dazzlingly and vanished toward the galley.\n \n \n\n \n Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after five days out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth; probably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn't attach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailed astern, attached by a long cable.\n \n Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifth day Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and she gently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.\n \n \"Even I know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder, Bob. That switch is for the—ah—the anathern tube, you told me. Right?\"\n \n \"Right,\" he said unsteadily. \"Anyway, Starre, as I was saying, this ship operates according to the reverse Fitzgerald Contraction Formula. All moving bodies contract in the line of motion. What Holloway and Hammond did was to reverse that universal law. They caused the contraction first—motion had to follow! The gravitonic field affects every atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We could go from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second just like that!\"\n \n He snapped his fingers. \"No acceleration effects. This type of ship, necessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move in any direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motion at—Oh, hell!\" Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making him shake. He took her hand. \"Starre,\" he said desperately, \"I've got to tell you something—\"\n \n She jerked her hand away. \"No,\" she exclaimed in an almost frightened voice. \"You can't tell me. There's—there's Mac,\" she finished, faltering. \"The asteroid—\"\n \n \"You have to marry him?\"\n \n Her eyes filled with tears. \"I have to live up to the bargain.\"\n \n \"And ruin your whole life,\" he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back to the control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely to the lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell ship trailing astern.\n \n \"There's your ship, Starre.\" He jabbed his finger at it. \"I've got a feeling—and I can't put the thought into concrete words—that somehow the whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back lies there. But how? How? \"\n \n Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it was attached around her ship's narrow midsection.\n \n She shook her head helplessly. \"It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.\"\n \n \"A yo-yo?\"\n \n \"Yes, a yo-yo. That's all.\" She was belligerent.\n \n \"A yo-yo !\" Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, he got out of the chair so fast. \"Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!\"\n \n He disappeared from the room. \"Queazy!\" he shouted. \" Queazy, I've got it! \"\n \n \n\n \n It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job, fastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's narrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to two winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and reinforced.\n \n The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob Parker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of cosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into strange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the end of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy snapped his fingers.\n \n \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the Saylor brothers are where we calculated!\"\n \n They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had discovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid on their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the Moon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to the still bigger asteroid—inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred thousand miles from Earth!\n \n \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within naked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was spread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere vaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship was two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant sky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.\n \n Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\"\n \n Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then sent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten miles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the\n\"yo-yo.\"\n \n There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But, scornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm the oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought, for Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero—and Starre Lowenthal's little ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!\n \n It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid lengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a fantastic spinning cannon ball.\n \n \"It's going to hit!\"\n \n The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship reached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of completing its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back up the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.\n \n \n\n \n Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuver for the \"yo-yo\" could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It was ticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used exactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of the ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in his glove—namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost exactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid dividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released again.\n \n All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor brothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on. But by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with better calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid between them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for the asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing it, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came spinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and again the \"yo-yo\" snapped out.\n \n And this time—collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the hand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to the principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had received a mere dent in its starboard half.\n \n Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This time we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\"\n \n The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly. Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish communication.\n \n Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the telaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in the plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.\n \n \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared.\n\"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our stern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\"\n \n \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\"\n \n \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor.\n \n \" If you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless you release the asteroid.\"\n \n \"I'll see you in Hades first!\"\n \n \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\"\n \n He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at zero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie.\n \n For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a doomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size with a strangled yell.\n \n The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in such a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as heavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling precision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it was apparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier, their ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space for a second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons from its still-intact jets.\n \n The battle was won!", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "386d46cd588944c0b01e5474b324d330", "response_text": "Bob Parker, the President of Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., sells asteroids to wealthy people on earth.

They’re startled by a woman who is squatting on the asteroid and claiming she is protected by law to remain there.

She told her grandfather that she would only marry the man he set her up with, Mac, if it was atop this exact asteroid - thinking that there was no way it was possible for it to be found, and if by small chance it was she would scare those people away.\n \nBob tells Starre they can still intercept the Saylor brothers’ ship since they have to take a long slow orbit back to Earth while his ship can go direct because it’s not towing an asteroid. Along the five day journey to Earth, Bob and Starre fall in love with each other, but Starre seems determined that she would have to keep her promise to marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered. They hook up Starre’s dumbbell shaped spaceship that they are towing like a yo-yo and use it to bludgeon the Saylor brothers’ ship, causing them to release the asteroid and jet away into outer space, leaving Bob, Queasy and Starre in possession.\n"}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "9f842112a409486c92a9c5da495e500f", "response_text": "Bob Parker and his partner Queazy are searching for an asteroid of exact proportions to meet a client’s demand. This job is very important because their company, Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., is in dire straits and likely to go under without the significant payday this asteroid will bring: $550,000. The client who requested an asteroid this size wants it for a wedding in his backyard by 11:30 am on June 2; otherwise, the order is void. Parker started the “asteroid in your backyard” promotion, but since then, other companies have been offering the same service. Most notably, competition from Saylor & Saylor is hurting his business. Parker and Queazy locate the perfect asteroid that meets the exact specifications of the request, only to find that someone else, a beautiful young woman, already has laid claim to it. She orders them to leave and threatens to report them to the Interplanetary Commission or to shoot them with her spasticizer. Parker explains why the asteroid is so important to them, and the girl explains that if they take it, she will meet a fate worse than death. Then suddenly, the Saylors’ ship comes into view and lands. Billy and Wally Saylor alight along with three other men, threatening Parker. So Parker tells them that he has an ethergram from Mr. Burnsides ordering this specific asteroid, but Wally announces that they also have the order. Bob grabs the girl’s spasticizer while Queazy grabs Billy Saylor and hurls him into space. But Wally shoots the spasticizer out of Bob’s hand, and someone hits Bob hard and knocks him out.\n\tWhen Bob regains consciousness, he is almost out of oxygen. He calls out for Queazy with his last breath, and Queazy responds and brings the ship to pick him up. The girl had rescued Queazy. She introduces herself as Starre Lowenthal, Mr. Burnside’s granddaughter. Her grandfather wants her to marry Mac andwouldn’tt take no for an answer, so finally Starre told him she would marry Mac if he could find an asteroid with specific dimensions and containing the minerals she specified. Bob knows the way the Saylors will have to take the asteroid into Earth’s orbit and knows they can catch up to them. He tells Starre they have to do that to say the business, but they will work out her problem, too. \n\tAfter five days, Bob is in love with Starre, and she knows it. He starts to tell her, but she stops him because of Mac and the bargain she has to live up to. Bob says he thinks her ship is the solution, and she says it’s just a big yo-yo. As Bob thinks about this, he devises a way to use her ship as a yo-yo to attack the Saylors’ ship.

Bob worries about the Saylor brothers from the beginning of the story, and he acknowledges that they do not always play by the rules. If Wally and Billy can make a buck by inconveniencing or cheating someone else, they will do it.

Yet, they still worry that somehow, someway, their enemies will hear about the potential to make half a million dollars and try to steal their opportunity out from under them. Within moments of setting eyes on their spaceship, Bob tells Starre that they have to fight the Saylor brothers together. He doesn’t know her at all, and she actually just pulled a gun on him, but he so deeply mistrusts Wally and Billy that it’s worth it to take a chance on Starre.\n\nOf course, Bob turns out to be right. The second the Saylor brothers get a chance to potentially kill Bob, Queazy, and Starre, they take it. Bob floats in space, unconscious, for several weeks before Starre eventually finds Queazy and Bob, and they give him oxygen and food. Bob is truly close to death before his friends save him in the knick of time, and the Saylor brothers would be perfectly fine with that outcome. \n\nWally and Billy give Bob all the motivation in the world to try and steal the asteroid back, and Bob is determined to catch up with his rivals and make it work somehow. When he comes up with his yo-yo idea using Starre’s ship, he shows zero empathy for the Saylor brothers. During his attempts to retrieve the rock, he seriously damages the brothers’ ship, and they have the gall to call him and attempt to make him feel guilty about their desperate state.

LUDWIG\n \n Illustrated by THORNE\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n One man's retreat is another's prison ... and it takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home!\n \n\n \n Forty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's been, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you what it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the stars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing fear—a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an evil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\n \n Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\n \n It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos, were over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and laboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after spawning its first-born.\n \n For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\n \n The first graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important, because we were the first .\n \n We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach of faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New Mexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and grandparents and kid brothers and sisters—the people who a short time ago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken wistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had never really existed.\n \n But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us with pride in their eyes.\n \n A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked hard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things. They're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately need. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land that will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most important of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up at them and feel humility—for mankind needs humility.\"\n \n The speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on Mars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and who had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\n \n Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders and his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth and skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time, for I was thinking:\n  He's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the others alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the first!\n \n \n \n\n \n Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't see 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n \n I blinked. \"Who?\"\n \n \"My folks.\"\n \n That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in a strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those\n\"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie Taggart.\n \n Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a veteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years ago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the Lunar Lady , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White Sands.\n \n I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island Spaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like me until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I remembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n \n My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It wasn't surprising. The Lunar Lady was in White Sands now, but liberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\n  It doesn't matter , I told myself.\n \n Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n \n Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a garden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a tenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that he was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at the Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was mighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only half as big.\n \n And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we were gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw the stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each like a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by the sons of Earth.\n  They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of civilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and a hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.\n \n \n I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.\n \n \n\n \n At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge, babbling wave.\n \n Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n \n His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining like a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear rows.\n \n But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and old, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that it was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n \n He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n \n \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate tonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as good spacemen should!\"\n \n Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again, walking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm with some silent melody.\n \n And you, Laura, were with him.\n \n \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n \n I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity of your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a golden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a gentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n \n \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for the past year.\"\n \n A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an introduction of Charlie.\n \n You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old Stardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie scorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a shiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol. His tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n \n And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the result of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so accustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I knew, would find them ugly.\n \n You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to meet you, Charlie. Just think—one of Everson's men, one of the first to reach the Moon!\"\n \n Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the weekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n \n I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're planning to see the town tonight.\"\n \n \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their own plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room. Charlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the Moon?\"\n \n Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew that he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian fizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n \n But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n \n \"We'd really like to come,\" I said.\n \n \n\n \n On our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was a tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor should look.\n \n \"Ben,\" he called, \"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two months to decide.\"\n \n \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\"\n \n A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben? Did he make you an offer?\"\n \n I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching astrogation. What a life that would be! Imagine standing in a classroom for forty years when I've got the chance to—\"\n \n I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you've got the chance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you want, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\"\n \n I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to understand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\n \n Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That's what Mickey used to want.\"\n \n \" Used to want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\n \n You bit your lip, not answering.\n \n \"What did she mean, Mickey?\"\n \n Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben. We've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But—\"\n \n \"Yes?\"\n \n \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty uniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If you're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or another gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\"\n \n My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to say, Mickey?\"\n \n \"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It's not so exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\"\n \n I couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my knees with the blast of a jet.\n \n \"It doesn't change anything, Ben—right now, I mean. We can still have a good weekend.\"\n \n Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to reach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the\n'copter.\n \n \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\"\n \n \n\n \n I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course. They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things, deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was cool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional video, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or housework.\n \n Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a shower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\n \n At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit Mars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic. Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough, the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid in your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that. Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\"\n \n That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\n \n Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night, to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally streaked up from White Sands.\n \n We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:\n\"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's sort of funny.\"\n \n \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those days, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a spaceman then.\"\n \n \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\"\n \n I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie doesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as I know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\n \n You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew suddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n \n There was silence.\n \n You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were flecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the feeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n \n You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking, Laura?\"\n \n You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be thinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n \n \"I could never hate you.\"\n \n \"It—it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you want to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were kids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I dreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I lived for months, just thinking about it.\n \n \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles, and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I realized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting before you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\"\n \n I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think maybe I haven't grown up yet?\"\n \n Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman, to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it worth the things you'd have to give up?\"\n \n I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up what ?\"\n \n Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\n \n All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\n \n Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on the stars.\n \n Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that I'd never noticed before.\n  You can go into space , I thought, and try to do as much living in ten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died in a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie buried in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like Charlie—a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally alone, never finding a home.\n \n  Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth in cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with a wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow old, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who fill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous dust.\n \n \n \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\n \n \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense—a lot of sense.\"\n \n \n\n \n The next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his scarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin, tight coughs.\n \n Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I'm leavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought maybe you'd like to have 'em.\"\n \n I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\"\n \n He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh, it's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years. That's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky. Some of these days, I won't be so lucky.\"\n \n I tried to laugh. \"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\"\n \n He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I'm gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell you what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a look inside. I'll probably be there.\"\n \n He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\n \n \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need's some Martian climate.\"\n \n Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered, too, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were drugged.\n \n I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about going to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\n \n We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\n \n \"When will you be back?\" you asked.\n \n Charlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a couple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\"\n \n Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\n \n I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill the doubt worming through my brain.\n \n But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was gone.\n \n \n\n \n That afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's room than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids treasure—pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy, books, a home-made video.\n \n I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy. I could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched their children grow to adulthood.\n \n I'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of them drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it had been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and routines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams, I hadn't realized I was different.\n  My folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd have lived the kind of life a kid should live.\n \n \n Mickey noticed my frown.\n \n \"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just not like you and Charlie, I guess. I—\"\n \n \"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\"\n \n \"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\"\n \n \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the Odyssey , the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me, too, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than teaching. I want to be in deep space.\"\n \n \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy Earth life while you can. Okay?\"\n \n I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted someone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of courage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\n \n But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the flecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever so slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as much as I loved the stars.\n \n And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure, I'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\"\n \n \n\n \n Forty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the little things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying down to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to teach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon and the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and promise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\n \n One morning I thought, Why must I make a choice? Why can't I have both you and the stars? Would that be asking too much?\n \n \n All day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\n \n That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I want you to be my wife.\"\n \n You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face flushed.\n \n Then you murmured, \"I—I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me to marry a spaceman or a teacher?\"\n \n \"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\"\n \n \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see, Ben? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for maybe two months, maybe two years. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty—and I'd have what?\"\n \n Somehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn't have to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years, then teach.\"\n \n \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't you want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\n \n Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears glittering in your eyes.\n \n \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened on the Cyclops . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was flooded with radiation—just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The men had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it was—\"\n \n \"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\"\n \n You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\"\n \n That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me sleep.\n  You've got to decide now , I told myself. You can't stay here. You've got to make a choice.\n \n \n The teaching job was still open. The spot on the Odyssey was still open—and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the way to Pluto.\n  You can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a home and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now.\n \n  Or you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a line in a history book.\n \n \n I cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \"Get the hell out of there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get out there on the Odyssey where you belong. We got a date on Mars, remember? At the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\"\n \n That's what he'd say.\n \n And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\n \n \"Oh God,\" I moaned, \"what shall I do?\"\n \n \n\n \n Next morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and brought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who could be sending me a message.\n \n I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping, automatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to inform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\"\n \n Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word\n\"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\"\n \n I stood staring at the cylinder.\n \n Charles Taggart was dead.\n \n Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\n \n My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie! The audiogram had lied!\n \n I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of Charles ...\"\n \n I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken voice droned on.\n \n You ran to it, shut it off. \"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly—\"\n \n Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I remembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze. The metallic words had told the truth.\n \n I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at Charlie's faded tin box.\n \n Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions—a few wrinkled photos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god, a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol.\n \n \n\n \n This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space. It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters instead of children, a medal instead of a home.\n  It'd be a great future , I thought. You'd dream of sitting in a dingy stone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky, stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls with dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first sign of lung-rot.\n \n \n To hell with it!\n \n I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\n \n I accepted that job teaching.\n \n \n\n \n And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping, and the house is silent.\n \n It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am writing this.\n \n I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they could tell me what he could not express in words.\n \n And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n \n A wedding ring.\n \n In that past he never talked about, there was a woman—his wife. Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to travel both. He later learned what we already know—that there can be no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n \n Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never live to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a man's dream.\n \n He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was kind—but that doesn't matter now.\n \n Do you know why he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n \n It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother, brothers, the planets his children.\n \n You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes after you reach it. But how can one ever be sure until the journey is made? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a star and think, I might have gone there; I could have been the first ?\n \n We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one be lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n \n Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his last night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration to you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n \n Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain the best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n \n Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep—at a dingy stone cafe on Mars, the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n \n Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever part of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n \n I have two wedding rings with me—his wife's ring and yours.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "85e20d36291f4c3eb3be04fdbf2fdf4b", "response_text": "After studying for six years, Ben sits at his U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight graduation.

Ben met Charlie, an accomplished spaceman, when he was a boy, and Charlie took him under his wing. When Ben connects with Charlie after the ceremony, he worries about his gaunt face and terrible cough. \n\nBen then meets Laura, Mickey’s sister. There is an undeniable and instant connection between them. Charlie only has 24 hours to spend with Ben before he has to report back for duty, and although he wants to have some drinks with Ben alone, Laura invites them both over, and Ben can’t help but say yes.\n\nMoments later, Dean Dawson reminds Ben about an offer to teach at the Academy. Mickey takes this opportunity to admit to Ben that he will be working as a Supervisor at White Sands Port. Ben is disappointed to hear that Mickey has chosen to live a boring life, but Mickey insists that he does not want to die in his 30s. \n\nAfter dinner at Mickey’s house, Laura and Ben take a walk together. Laura asks about Charlie’s life before he was a spaceman, but Ben doesn’t have answers for her. He doesn’t know anything about Charlie’s past.

It all begins in June of 1965 in New Mexico when the first class of the U.S. Academy of Interplentary Flight is finally graduating after six years. These 25 students were trained to take on interplanetary flight and space exploration, so they can continue to discover the outer planets. Robert Chandler gave a speech detailing why these brave men were so important to modern society, as women were not allowed to become space explorers. Mickey and Ben, graduates and friends, sat next to each other during the ceremony. Mickey struggles to find his family in the crowd, and Ben reveals that he was orphaned after his parents died in a rocket crash. A spaceman named Charlie Taggart (Stardust Charlie) raised him instead. He was one of the oldest spacemen ever, having travelled for nearly 25 years, and was the Chief Jetman on the Lunar Lady. \nAfter the ceremony, Ben runs into Charlie and sees how much he’s aged in just a year. He looks ill and drugged, but he still asks Ben to celebrate with him. Before Ben can respond, Mickey and his sister Laura came up to him. He is instantly attracted to her and feels a connection. Ben was supposed to spend the weekend with Mickey and his family, but now that Charlie’s in town he feels conflicted. Both Ben and Charlie decide to join them, despite Charlie not being a family man. Dean Dawson, an academy professor, approaches Ben and reminds him of his job offer at the Academy. Ben turns him down laughing, until Mickey reveals that he is not going to space anymore. Instead, he’ll be the Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Sport. After an awkward dinner together, Laura and Ben went stargazing and spoke of Charlie and the draw of space. Laura hints at loving Ben, but doesn’t say it outright. Charlie left the next day, but left Ben some of his possessions. He knows he hasn’t got much time in this universe, but he goes back to Mars anyways. \nWith several job options to choose from, Ben decides to stay at Mickey’s house for the timebeing. He stays for 40 days and nights, spending much of his time with Laura. He asked Laura to marry him, but she says she’d only marry him if he were a teacher, not a spaceman. Ben was faced with a serious conundrum. The next day he received word that Charlges Taggart died of lung-rot, and Ben broke down. Ben sifted through Charlie’s possessions and decided to take on a the teaching gig for Dawson. However, after looking through the box again, he found a wedding ring. Seeing himself in Charlie, Ben decided to fly to the stone cafe on Mars called the Space Rat where Stardust Charlie said he’d be waiting for him. \n"}, {"worker_id": "10", "uid": "36695036dc4a4779b90033922ea594e9", "response_text": "Nearly the entire story is a recollection of the narrator, Ben, as he writes a letter to his love, Laura, who he is leaving behind for his dreams of becoming a spaceman.\nIn June of 1995, Ben and Mickey are sitting together during their graduation ceremony from the first class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, looking at out at the audience for their guests. Mickey is cheerful and generally accepts the world with a smile. Ben’s invited guest, Charlie Taggart, is a pioneering spaceman of 25 years who he thinks of as a parental figure since his parents died in a strato-jet crash when he was four. Ben and Mickey both spot their guests, and there is a contrasting moment between Ben’s orphaned upbringing and Mickey’s family.\nCharlie looks different from the other guests, with scars on his face, and a missing button on his suit - known for doing things his own way. Charlie is a veteran of the explorer Everson's first trip to the Moon, and he had spent his life in space. Mickey introduces Ben to his sister, Laura, after the ceremony. Since Mickey has invited Ben to spend the weekend with them, Laura goes a step further to also invite Charlie, which they both accept. Charlie leaves after one night, gifting Ben a tin box of “souvenirs” from his life, foreshadowing his imminent passing.\nAlthough Ben and Mickey both graduated from the school of interplanetary flight, they have both been offered terrestrial jobs. Ben was offered a job teaching Astrogation at the Academy by Dean Dawson. No doubt very prestigious, but Ben dreams of being the first to visit new planets with Mickey. Mickey awkwardly reveals he had a change of heart, citing that spacemen have short lives because of the demands and danger. Mickey was offered a Cargo Supervisor role at the White Sands Port that he accepted because he will “live a lot longer” there.\nBen is deeply uncertain about his future, accepting Mickey’s offer to stay until he figures it out. During the forty days and forty nights he spends with them he falls in love with Laura and contemplates a family life on Earth with her - even proposing marriage to her - but his desire to be a spaceman remains a barrier to them being together. After Ben learns of Charlie’s death (at “home” on Mars), he remembers the box Charlie gave him.

Ben and his friend Mickey looked around for the one person Ben had invited: Charlie Taggart, aka \"Spaceman Charlie\". They spotted him, and Ben was relieved; the three of them went out afterwards to celebrate along with Mickey's sister, Laura. Ben explained that he'd been offered a teaching job at The Academy but wanted to join an exploratory crew. After getting to the helicopter, Ben eventually met Laura and Charlie's parents--simple people who were happy to live on Earth and not be going anywhere any time soon. Charlie did his best to interact with these new people, even though he told some disturbing stories. Laura and Ben headed to the terrace to look for rockets and talked about Charlie; Laura had a lot of questions about his past. They shared a quiet moment, appreciating each other, before Laura made a comment about the desire to go to the stars might be a disappointment: if they weren't what they seemed, maybe they would never be enough. She asked Ben if he really wanted to give up everything he could have, making Ben sad. The next morning, Charlie returned to work and left a box of belongings with Ben; it was only then when Ben became worried about the coughing he'd noticed over the past day, and his glassy eyes and stiff movements. Before they could talk, Charlie was gone. Later, in Mickey's room, Ben reflected on how his childhood was different from that of other children, after his parents died in a rocket crash. It was after this that he realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to stay or to go, and agreed to stay with Mickey's family until he made a decision about what to do. He spent most of the time with Laura, and after forty days of this he proposed to her, prompting her to ask what he wanted to do for his job. She didn't want to marry someone who would be absent, or someone in such a dangerous profession, but would feel better if he stayed and worked as a teacher, because she loved him too.  It was the next day that Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. Shocked, he looked through the box of belongings that Charlie had left him, and after seeing what little Charlie had left behind in terms of meaningful connections, he called The Academy to accept the teaching job. In the end, though, Ben recognized that he would never be happy without trying to explore the stars, so he tells Laura he will not be around when she wakes up because he has to see what's out there, and takes Laura's wedding ring and that of Charlie's wife with him, as mementos.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n Getting specimens for the interstellar zoo was no problem—they battled for the honor—but now I had to fight like a wildcat to keep a display from making a monkey of me!\n \n\n \n It was our first day of recruiting on the planet, and the alien life-forms had lined up for hundreds of feet back from my rented office. As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and see and smell them with ease.\n \n My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwise in front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The aliens came in every shape and form, in all colors and textures—and all of them eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarre beings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the old exhibitionist urge.\n \n \"Send them in one at a time,\" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the office, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to begin.\n \n The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the official Terran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people were accustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV and referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals happy wherever I go.\n \n Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim sign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS! We had saturated MacTavish IV with our promotional poop for a month preceding arrival. Stuff like this:\n  Want to visit Earth—see the Galaxy's most glittering and exclusive world? Want to draw good pay, work short hours, experience the thrills of show business on romantic Terra? If you are a non-terrestrial, there may be a place for you in the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science. No freaks wanted—normal beings only. J. F. Corrigan will hold interviews in person on Ghryne from Thirdday to Fifthday of Tenmonth. His last visit to the Caledonia Cluster until\n2937, so don't miss your chance! Hurry! A life of wonder and riches can be yours!\n \n \n \n\n \n Broadsides like that, distributed wholesale in half a thousand languages, always bring them running. And the Corrigan Institute really packs in the crowds back on Earth. Why not? It's the best of its kind, the only really decent place where Earthmen can get a gander at the other species of the universe.\n \n The office buzzer sounded. Auchinleck said unctuously, \"The first applicant is ready to see you, sir.\"\n \n \"Send him, her or it in.\"\n \n The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on nervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a big basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and five double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body. There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones, one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.\n \n \n\n \n His voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. \"You are Mr. Corrigan?\"\n \n \"That's right.\" I reached for a data blank. \"Before we begin, I'll need certain information about—\"\n \n \"I am a being of Regulus II,\" came the grave, booming reply, even before I had picked up the blank. \"I need no special care and I am not a fugitive from the law of any world.\"\n \n \"Your name?\"\n \n \"Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.\"\n \n I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick cough. \"Let me have that again, please?\"\n \n \"Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands for Raymond.\"\n \n \"Of course, that's not the name you were born with.\"\n \n The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation, remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of an apologetic smile. \"My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and shall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see.\"\n \n \n\n \n The little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained.\n\"You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\n \n \"I'll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You'll pay for my services, transportation and expenses. I'll be required to remain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.\"\n \n \"And the pay will be—ah—$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses and transportation.\"\n \n The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping on one side, two on the other. \"Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I accept the terms!\"\n \n I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into the other office to sign him up.\n \n I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show; the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him didn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get to Earth. My conscience won't let me really exploit a being, but I don't believe in throwing money away, either.\n \n The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet, four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at anything short of top rate.\n \n Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a handout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supply of, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even get the handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging.\n \n The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.\n \n \n\n \n It was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into the successful proprietor of Corrigan's Institute, after some years as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in\n2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement.\n \n Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down, a non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a scientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo.\n \n That's what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is, of course. A zoo. But we don't go out and hunt for our specimens; we advertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth once in his lifetime, and there's only one way he can do it.\n \n We don't keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens before this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms. My goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I reach that, I'll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can.\n \n After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new specimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids, fifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no less than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks.\n \n It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a Ghrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some\n400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn't see how we could take one on. They're gentle and likable beings, but their upkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any old kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan.\n \n \"One more specimen before lunch,\" I told Stebbins, \"to make it an even dozen.\"\n \n He looked at me queerly and nodded. A being entered. I took a long close look at the life-form when it came in, and after that I took another one. I wondered what kind of stunt was being pulled. So far as I could tell, the being was quite plainly nothing but an Earthman.\n \n He sat down facing me without being asked and crossed his legs. He was tall and extremely thin, with pale blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, and though he was clean and reasonably well dressed, he had a shabby look about him. He said, in level Terran accents, \"I'm looking for a job with your outfit, Corrigan.\"\n \n \"There's been a mistake. We're interested in non-terrestrials only.\"\n \n \"I'm a non-terrestrial. My name is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Wazzenazz XIII.\"\n \n \n\n \n I don't mind conning the public from time to time, but I draw the line at getting bilked myself. \"Look, friend, I'm busy, and I'm not known for my sense of humor. Or my generosity.\"\n \n \"I'm not panhandling. I'm looking for a job.\"\n \n \"Then try elsewhere. Suppose you stop wasting my time, bud. You're as Earthborn as I am.\"\n \n \"I've never been within a dozen parsecs of Earth,\" he said smoothly. \"I happen to be a representative of the only Earthlike race that exists anywhere in the Galaxy but on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is a small and little-known planet in the Crab Nebula. Through an evolutionary fluke, my race is identical with yours. Now, don't you want me in your circus?\"\n \n \"No. And it's not a circus. It's—\"\n \n \"A scientific institute. I stand corrected.\"\n \n There was something glib and appealing about this preposterous phony. I guess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on his ear without another word. Instead I played along. \"If you're from such a distant place, how come you speak English so well?\"\n \n \"I'm not speaking. I'm a telepath—not the kind that reads minds, just the kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate back to colloquial speech.\"\n \n \"Very clever, Mr. Gorb.\" I grinned at him and shook my head. \"You spin a good yarn—but for my money, you're really Sam Jones or Phil Smith from Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to Earth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low these days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.\"\n \n He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, \"You're making a big mistake. I'm just what your outfit needs. A representative of a hitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect! Look here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And—\"\n \n I pulled away from his yawning mouth. \"Good-by, Mr. Gorb,\" I repeated.\n \n \"All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn't much. I'll be a big attraction. I'll—\"\n \n \" Good-by, Mr. Gorb! \"\n \n He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to the door. \"I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think it over. Maybe you'll regret your hastiness. I'll be back to give you another chance.\"\n \n He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile. This was the best con switch yet—an Earthman posing as an alien to get a job!\n \n But I wasn't buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness intellectually. There's no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there's only one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. I was going to need some real good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket home.\n \n I didn't know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that reason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.\n \n \n\n \n The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan, and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds. Hardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him officially.\n \n He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high, and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three stocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture, and growled, \"I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me immediately to a contract.\"\n \n \"Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.\"\n \n \"You will grant me a contract!\"\n \n \"Will you please sit down?\"\n \n He said sulkily, \"I will remain standing.\"\n \n \"As you prefer.\" My desk has a few concealed features which are sometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed life-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of trouble.\n \n The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They're hairy creatures, and this one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his body. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket of fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his warlike race.\n \n I said, \"You'll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it's not our policy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our Institute. And we're not currently in need of any Kallerian males, because—\"\n \n \"You will hire me or trouble I will make!\"\n \n I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already carrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.\n \n The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. \"Yes, you have four representatives—of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn! For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to the noble Clan Gursdrinn!\"\n \n At the key-word avenge , I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian in a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he didn't move. He bellowed, \"I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to Earth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!\"\n \n \n\n \n I'm a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and one of the most important of those principles is that I never let myself be bullied by anyone. \"I deeply regret having unintentionally insulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?\"\n \n He glared at me in silence.\n \n I went on, \"Please be assured that I'll undo the insult at the earliest possible opportunity. It's not feasible for us to hire another Kallerian now, but I'll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon as a vacancy—\"\n \n \"No. You will hire me now.\"\n \n \"It can't be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to it.\"\n \n \"You will rue! I will take drastic measures!\"\n \n \"Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I'll get in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another Kallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting—\"\n \n You'd think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a zoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there's always the chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we're insulting all the others.\n \n I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and Ludlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left. They surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him away. He wasn't minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked them both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw, but he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was out in the hall.\n \n I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next applicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped open and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins.\n \n \"Come here, you!\"\n \n \"Stebbins?\" I said gently.\n \n \"I'm sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he came running in—\"\n \n \"Please, please,\" squeaked the little alien pitifully. \"I must see you, honored sir!\"\n \n \"It isn't his turn in line,\" Stebbins protested. \"There are at least fifty ahead of him.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"All right,\" I said tiredly. \"As long as he's in here already, I might as well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.\"\n \n Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out.\n \n \n\n \n The alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking creature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a lustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His tail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at full volume.\n \n \"Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a being of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel to Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with yourself.\"\n \n I said, \"I'd better tell you right at the outset that we're already carrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a female now and—\"\n \n \"This is known to me. The female—is her name perchance Tiress?\"\n \n I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian entry. \"Yes, that's her name.\"\n \n The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. \"It is she! It is she!\"\n \n \"I'm afraid we don't have room for any more—\"\n \n \"You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress, she is—was—my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life and my love.\"\n \n \"Funny,\" I said. \"When we signed her three years ago, she said she was single. It's right here on the chart.\"\n \n \"She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors of Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry, languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You must take me to Earth!\"\n \n \"But—\"\n \n \"I must see her—her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must reason with her. Earthman, can't you see I must appeal to her inner flame? I must bring her back! \"\n \n My face was expressionless. \"You don't really intend to join our organization at all—you just want free passage to Earth?\"\n \n \"Yes, yes!\" wailed the Stortulian. \"Find some other member of my race, if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead lump of stone?\"\n \n \n\n \n It isn't, but another of my principles is to refuse to be swayed by sentiment. I felt sorry for this being's domestic troubles, but I wasn't going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel happy—not to mention footing the transportation.\n \n I said, \"I don't see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict on the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for scientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in coming isn't scientific, I can't in all conscience lie for you, can I?\"\n \n \"Well—\"\n \n \"Of course not.\" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right along. \"Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up, I might conceivably have done it. But no—you had to go unburden your heart to me.\"\n \n \"I thought the truth would move you.\"\n \n \"It did. But in effect you're now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent criminal act. Friend, I can't do it. My reputation means too much to me,\" I said piously.\n \n \"Then you will refuse me?\"\n \n \"My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can't take you to Earth.\"\n \n \"Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?\"\n \n There's a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an unwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of scientific interest, and the World Government will deport the undesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn't pull a low trick like that on our female Stortulian.\n \n I said, \"I'll ask her about coming home. But I won't ship her back against her will. And maybe she's happier where she is.\"\n \n The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask his tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a living dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, \"There is no hope then. All is lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.\"\n \n He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping. I watched him shuffle out. I do have some conscience, and I had the uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to commit suicide on my account.\n \n \n\n \n About fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life started to get complicated again.\n \n Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.\n \n I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian's outraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door opened and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII stepped in.\n \n \"How did you get in here?\" I demanded.\n \n \"Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,\" he said cheerily.\n\"Change your mind about me yet?\"\n \n \"Get out before I have you thrown out.\"\n \n Gorb shrugged. \"I figured you hadn't changed your mind, so I've changed my pitch a bit. If you won't believe I'm from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I tell you that I am Earthborn, and that I'm looking for a job on your staff.\"\n \n \"I don't care what your story is! Get out or—\"\n \n \"—you'll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second. Corrigan, you're no fool, and neither am I—but that fellow of yours outside is . He doesn't know how to handle alien beings. How many times today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?\"\n \n I scowled at him. \"Too damn many.\"\n \n \"You see? He's incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead. I've been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is to know about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.\"\n \n I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling of the office before I spoke. \"Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is, I've had a hard day. There's been a Kallerian in here who just about threatened murder, and there's been a Stortulian in here who's about to commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it's troubling me. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and go home to Earth. I don't want you hanging around here bothering me. I'm not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to claiming you're an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is that I'm not looking for any of those either. Now will you scram or—\"\n \n The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian, came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glittering metalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wielding a sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck came dragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt.\n \n \"Sorry, Chief,\" Stebbins gasped. \"I tried to keep him out, but—\"\n \n Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him out with a roar. \"Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!\"\n \n \n\n \n Sitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to let him have it at the first sight of actual violence.\n \n Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have notified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the death of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"\n \n \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He's going to—\"\n \n An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun trigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it savagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the sword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\n \n Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the green sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down at the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\n \n \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.\n \n \"Y-yes.\"\n \n \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint being—\"\n \n \"—that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of the Ghrynian policemen.\n \n \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver of the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several minutes ago.\"\n \n \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest you for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than\n$100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"\n \n \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the Universe can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and I'm responsible?\"\n \n \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to this late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\n \n \"Well, no, but—\"\n \n \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\n \n \n\n \n Closing my eyes wearily, I tried to wish the whole babbling lot of them away. If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was going to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000 per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.\n \n I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced arrival.\n \n The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a moment and turned to eye the newcomer.\n \n I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I resolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again—or, if I did come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against crackpots.\n \n In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me to do.\"\n \n I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers going down the drain. \"Stop him, somebody! He's going to kill himself! He's—\"\n \n Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I guess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on.\n \n Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The man who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting himself off.\n \n He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that Stortulian wasn't here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get you.\"\n \n I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.\n \n \"Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian psychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely abhorrent to them. When they're troubled, they kill the person who caused their trouble. In this case, you.\"\n \n \n\n \n I began to chuckle—more of a tension-relieving snicker than a full-bodied laugh.\n \n \"Funny,\" I said.\n \n \"What is?\" asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.\n \n \"These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye and killed himself , and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek and pathetic damn near blew my head off.\" I shuddered. \"Thanks for the tackle job.\"\n \n \"Don't mention it,\" Gorb said.\n \n I glared at the Ghrynian police. \"Well? What are you waiting for? Take that murderous little beast out of here! Or isn't murder against the local laws?\"\n \n \"The Stortulian will be duly punished,\" replied the leader of the Ghrynian cops calmly. \"But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian and the fine of—\"\n \n \"—one hundred thousand dollars. I know.\" I groaned and turned to Stebbins. \"Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them send down a legal adviser. Find out if there's any way we can get out of this mess with our skins intact.\"\n \n \"Right, Chief.\" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.\n \n Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.\n \n \"Hold it,\" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. \"The Consulate can't help you. I can.\"\n \n \"You?\" I said.\n \n \"I can get you out of this cheap.\"\n \n \" How cheap?\"\n \n Gorb grinned rakishly. \"Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a specimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That's a heck of a lot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn't it?\"\n \n I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn't be much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they were really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials ever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand, giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.\n \n \"Tell you what,\" I said finally. \"You've got yourself a deal—but on a contingency basis. Get me out of this and you'll have five grand and the contract. Otherwise, nothing.\"\n \n Gorb shrugged. \"What have I to lose?\"", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "a7f565ae5ede4db6983127542cfd1675", "response_text": "Sometime after the year 2903, the narrator of the story, Mr. Corrigan, is having a recruiting day on the planet of Ghryne, which he privately calls MacTavish IV. Mr. Corrigan owns a popular zoo on Earth called the Corrigan Institute - the only place where humans can see other species of the universe. He recruits alien life forms to exhibit at the zoo, and relatively quickly signs eleven new specimens onto his current 690 that are under contract at the institute on earth. This is a viable business because the World Congress declared Earth off-bounds to aliens in 2903, and the only way aliens can now go to Earth is as exhibits in this zoo.\n\nAliens make great sacrifices to come interview with Mr. Corrigan, as it seems he offers them a good deal. Those under contract are required to remain on exhibit for less than one-third of each day and get paid $50 Galactic a week, with expenses and transportation included. \n\nHe interviews many different creatures through the day, with some being noteworthy and some not as much, being ushered away quickly by Mr. Corrigan’s assistant Stebbins. \n\nA Stortulian who claims his wife ran away to the Corrigan Institute, leaving him alone and unable to remarry due to his customs, pleads with Corrigan to let him go to Earth or at the very least to send her back. Mr. Corrigan is slightly frazzled by the story, but ultimately asks the Stortulian to leave, feeling sad and that he may commit suicide upon leaving and losing hope for his wife to return.\nVallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV, was another notable interview. He stormed in and demanded to be signed to contract - and Mr. Corrigan preferred to make his own decisions. Herald felt insulted that the only four Kallerians at the institute were from the Clan Verdrokh, with no representation at all from his Clan Gursdrinn. Corrigan insisted he was unable to take another Kallerian, and apologized for insulting Clan Gursdrinn. This was enough to de-escalate physical violence, but Heraal was not pleased, and had to be escorted out of the room by Auchinleck and Ludlow who were summoned when Corrigan pushed a panic button under his desk.\nIn a surprise twist from what Corrigan had expected - the Stortulian to kill himself, and for Heraal to try to kill him - the opposite happens. Heraal storms in and stabs himself with his own sword, killing him instantly. The Stortulian returns and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, who is narrowly saved by being tackled by Gorb. The Ghrynian cops attempt to place a $100,000 fine on Corrigan for causing the death of a being (Heraal, who killed himself after being refused a contract).

His first applicant of the day walks in: a round creature with five eyed-arms and two legs. He introduces himself as Lawrence R. Fitzgerald of Regulus II, showing himself to be a Terraphile. Corrigan signs him on for half the normal pay and sends him on his way. A urisinoid from Aldebaran IX is next, but Corrigan has no need for another one. He signs a creature from Donovan’s Planet, since they are such crowd-pleasers, and nine more. He also turns down at least 87 other life-forms, only of which, a Vegan, he feels remorse about. \nHis last specimen before lunch seems to be an Earthman pulling a con. He calls himself Ildwar Gorb and claims he’s from Wazzenaxx XIII. Corrigan doesn’t believe his tale and sends him out, though Gorb promises he’ll change his mind before long. \nAfter lunch, trouble starts to arise. A Kallerian comes in and demands a place in his zoo, even though they already have four. Vallo Heraal of Clan Gursdrinn feels Corrigan has insulted his clan by only hiring members of Clan Verdrokh.

He presses his trouble button, and his men come in and take Heraal away. \nA small alien runs into the room, sneaking past Stebbins, and begs to be brought to Earth so he can reunite with his soulmate, a previously hired Stortulian.

Although he is generous, he is also thrifty and not above conning the public in the name of advancing his business. Corrigan arrives at the planet Ghryne to interview potential new non-terrestrials for his exhibition assisted by his employees Stebbins, Auchinleck, and Ludlow. He interviews dozens of non-terrestrials from planets all over the galaxy, including Mr. Lawrence R. Fitzgerald, a self-described Terraphile from Regulus II who wants to go to Earth so badly he is willing to work for less pay. Next, Corrigan meets Ildwar Gorb, a non-terrestrial from Wazzenazz XIII who looks remarkably like a human and claims to communicate through telepathic projection. Because of this similarity, Corrigan suspects him of actually being an Earthman attempting to con him for a free ride back to Earth. He dismisses Gorb, who implores him to reconsider and promises to return. After Gorb leaves, a Kallerian named Vallo Heraal enters and demands Corrigan hire him immediately or he will cause trouble. Wary of the Kallerian's size and threats, Corrigan fingers the meshgun trigger hidden under his desk in case he needs to protect himself. After Auchinleck and Ludlow escort Heraal out of the room, a small Stortulian enters Corrigan's office and tells him he doesn't want to work for him necessarily, but he is seeking passage to Earth so he can be reunited with his wife, who is currently under Corrigan's employ at the Institute.  When Corrigan refuses, the Stortulian leaves, and Corrigan process several dozen more applicants. When Gorb reenters and offers to replace Stebbins due to his incompetent handling of the non-terrestrials waiting in line, Corrigan threatens to have him thrown out. At that moment, Heraal returns, brandishing a large sword, which he uses to kill himself in front of everyone. As Corrigan processes this turn of events, the Ghrynian police enter and charge Corrigan with Heraal's death which includes a $100,000 Galactic fine. Next, the Stortulian reenters and attempts to shoot Corrigan, who is saved by Gorb. Gorb offers to solve Corrigan's legal liability for the death of Heraal in exchange for $5,000 Galactic and a contract with the Corrigan Institute. Corrigan agrees to the arrangement, so long as Gorb upholds his end of the bargain first."}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "ef88bf683be64fd68c6c988c624f28a9", "response_text": "J. F. Corrigan of Earth’s Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is on the planet MacTavish IV (aka Ghryne by its natives) to recruit alien life forms as specimens for display in what is effectively a zoo. This is the only way aliens can visit Earth because in 2903 the World Congress declared Earth off-limits for non-terrestrials. Throughout the day, Corrigan interviews many colorful, interesting alien life forms, ultimately hiring about two dozen. His goal is to have a collection of at least one member of 500 different races and currently has 298. He rejects some applicants simply because he already has specimens of their type. One applicant, Gorb, looks and sounds like a human but claims to be from a plant named Wazzenazz XIII. Corrigan is convinced he is just a human and sends him on his way, but Gorb says he will be back to give Corrigan another chance. \nLater in the day, Corrigan has two troublesome interviews, the first with a distraught Kallerian named Vallo Heraal who wants to be hired because four other Kallerians have been hired from a different clan than his, and he feels his clan has been insulted. Corrigan apologizes for having unintentionally insulted Heraal’s clan but explains that he doesn’t need any more Kallerians now; he offers to give preference to Heraal’s clan when there is a vacancy. Unappeased, Heraal warns Corrigan that he will be sorry, and Corrigan sends for members of his team to escort him out. Next, a squirrely-looking Stortulian slips in, exclaiming that he must speak with Corrigan. The Stortulian explains that he is there because his wife is on Earth in Corrigan’s display. She left him because she wanted to go to Earth, and now he is lonely but forbidden by his customs to remarry. He doesn’t want to be hired but just wants passage to Earth to persuade his wife to return home. Corrigan patiently tells the Stortulian he can’t take him because it would be illegal. The Stortullian accepts defeat, saying he has no hope at all, and Corrigan has the distinct impression that the fellow is going to commit suicide. \nAt the end of the day, Gorb returns, asking Corrigan to hire him to work with his company. Heraal crashes in and tells Corrigan he has contacted the authorities and accused him of causing the death of a life-form before he kills himself. The police arrive to arrest Corrigan, but the Stortulian returns, again claiming his life isn’t worth living and fires a shot at Corrigan who is saved by the swift action of Gorb who pushes him out of the way.\n"}]}, {"question_text": "Who is Mr. Fitzgerald and what happens to him in the story?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "a7f565ae5ede4db6983127542cfd1675", "response_text": "Lawrence Raymond Fitzgerald is a being of Regulus II, who is a self-procclaimed Terrophile, who changed his name to a famous human’s which pleases Mr. Corrigan.\nMr. Fitzgerald had a very deep voice, and was a yellow-green spherical shape the size of a basketball, with two double-kneed legs and five double-elbowed arms.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n With never a moment to rest, the pursuit through space felt like a game of hounds and hares ... or was it follow the leader?\n \n\n \n Ben Curtis eased his pale, gaunt body through the open doorway of the Blast Inn, the dead man following silently behind him.\n \n His fear-borne gaze traveled into the dimly illumined Venusian gin mill. The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose ingredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n \n Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco smoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and there, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen, Martians or Venusians.\n \n Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it was the dead man's hand.\n \n \" Coma esta, senor? \" a small voice piped. \" Speken die Deutsch? Desirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet? \"\n \n Ben looked down.\n \n The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was like a red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn skivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.\n \n \"I'm American,\" Ben muttered.\n \n \"Ah, buena ! I speak English tres fine, senor . I have Martian friend, she tres pretty and tres fat. She weigh almost eighty pounds, monsieur . I take you to her, si ?\"\n \n Ben shook his head.\n \n \n\n \n He thought, I don't want your Martian wench. I don't want your opium or your Devil's Egg or your Venusian kali. But if you had a drug that'd bring a dead man to life, I'd buy and pay with my soul.\n \n \n \"It is deal, monsieur ? Five dollars or twenty keelis for visit Martian friend. Maybe you like House of Dreams. For House of Dreams—\"\n \n \"I'm not buying.\"\n \n The dirty-faced kid shrugged. \"Then I show you to good table,— tres bien . I do not charge you, senor .\"\n \n The boy grabbed his hand. Because Ben could think of no reason for resisting, he followed. They plunged into shifting layers of smoke and through the drone of alcohol-cracked voices.\n \n \n\n \n They passed the bar with its line of lean-featured, slit-eyed Earthmen—merchant spacemen.\n \n They wormed down a narrow aisle flanked by booths carved from Venusian marble that jutted up into the semi-darkness like fog-blanketed tombstones.\n \n Several times, Ben glimpsed the bulky figures of CO\n 2\n -breathing Venusians, the first he'd ever seen.\n \n They were smoky gray, scaly, naked giants, toads in human shape. They stood solitary and motionless, aloof, their green-lidded eyes unblinking. They certainly didn't look like telepaths, as Ben had heard they were, but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine.\n \n Once he spied a white-uniformed officer of Hoover City's Security Police. The man was striding down an aisle, idly tapping his neuro-club against the stone booths.\n  Keep walking , Ben told himself. You look the same as anyone else here. Keep walking. Look straight ahead.\n \n \n The officer passed. Ben breathed easier.\n \n \"Here we are, monsieur ,\" piped the Martian boy. \"A tres fine table. Close in the shadows.\"\n \n Ben winced. How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows? Frowning, he sat down—he and the dead man.\n \n He listened to the lonely rhythms of the four-piece Martian orchestra.\n \n The Martians were fragile, doll-like creatures with heads too large for their spindly bodies. Their long fingers played upon the strings of their cirillas or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider legs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still seemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and forgotten grandeur.\n \n For an instant, Ben's mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead man. He thought, What are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in a smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world? Couldn't they have played their music on Mars? Or had they, like me, felt the challenge of new worlds?\n \n \n He sobered. It didn't matter. He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese waiter. He wet his lips but did not drink. His gaze wandered over the faces of the Inn's other occupants.\n  You've got to find him , he thought. You've got to find the man with the red beard. It's the only way you can escape the dead man.\n \n \n \n\n \n The dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby and about forty and he hated spacemen.\n \n His body was buried now—probably in the silent gray wastes outside Luna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a part of Ben as sight in his eyes.\n \n Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips spitting whiskey-slurred curses.\n \n Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fist thudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the whiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle from a corner of the gaping mouth.\n \n You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or ignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from a memory that has burned into your mind.\n \n It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had been successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate. He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb plopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.\n \n \"Spacemen,\" he muttered, \"are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you see's spacemen.\"\n \n He was a neatly dressed civilian.\n \n Ben smiled. \"If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.\"\n \n \"The name's Cobb.\" The man hiccoughed. \"Spacemen in their white monkey suits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're a little tin god.\" He downed a shot of whiskey.\n \n Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white, crimson-braided uniform of the Odyssey's junior astrogation officer. He was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining uniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.\n \n He'd sought long for that key.\n \n \n\n \n At the age of five—perhaps in order to dull the memory of his parents' death in a recent strato-jet crash—he'd spent hours watching the night sky for streaking flame-tails of Moon rockets. At ten, he'd ground his first telescope. At fourteen, he'd converted an abandoned shed on the government boarding-school grounds to a retreat which housed his collection of astronomy and rocketry books.\n \n At sixteen, he'd spent every weekend holiday hitchhiking from Boys Town No. 5 in the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport. There, among the grizzled veterans of the old Moon Patrol, he'd found friends who understood his dream and who later recommended his appointment to the U. S. Academy for the Conquest of Space.\n \n And a month ago, he'd signed aboard the Odyssey —the first ship, it was rumored, equipped to venture as far as the asteroids and perhaps beyond.\n \n Cobb was persistent: \"Damn fools shoulda known enough to stay on Earth. What the hell good is it, jumpin' from planet to planet?\"\n  The guy's drunk , Ben thought. He took his drink and moved three stools down the bar.\n \n Cobb followed. \"You don't like the truth, eh, kid? You don't like people to call you a sucker.\"\n \n Ben rose and started to leave the bar, but Cobb grabbed his arm and held him there.\n \n \"Thas what you are—a sucker. You're young now. Wait ten years. You'll be dyin' of radiation rot or a meteor'll get you. Wait and see, sucker!\"\n \n Until this instant, Ben had suppressed his anger. Now, suddenly and without warning, it welled up into savage fury.\n \n His fist struck the man on the chin. Cobb's eyes gaped in shocked horror. He spun backward. His head cracked sickeningly on the edge of the bar. The sound was like a punctuation mark signaling the end of life.\n \n He sank to the floor, eyes glassy, blood tricking down his jaw.\n \n Ben knew that he was dead.\n \n Then, for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror—just as, a moment before, he'd been overwhelmed with anger.\n \n He ran.\n \n \n\n \n For some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world of dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\n \n At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw that he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the city.\n \n He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette. A thousand stars—a thousand motionless balls of silver fire—shone above him through Luna City's transparent dome.\n \n He was sorry he'd hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he'd run. Escaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\n  You can do two things , he thought.\n  You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do. That would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary manslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in prison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free.\n \n  But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new men over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class jet-men on beat-up freighters—they don't want convicted killers. You'd get the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by peeking through electric fences of spaceports.\n \n  Or—\n \n \n There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who operated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't outlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\n \n And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the souped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their headquarters was Venus. Their leader—a subject of popular and fantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines—was rumored to be a red-bearded giant.\n  So , Ben reflected, you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously. You can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your name. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your duty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from Earth.\n \n \n After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant second, to destroy a man's life and his dream?\n \n \n\n \n He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last flight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new personnel even more so.\n \n Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n \n There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the memory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him as constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n \n But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead voice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways obscure the dead face?\n \n So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant, and hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n \n \"You look for someone, senor ?\"\n \n He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n \n \" Oui. \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I keep you company on your first night in Hoover City, n'est-ce-pas ?\"\n \n \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n \n \"You are spacemen?\"\n \n Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will you?\"\n \n Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \" Ich danke, senor. You know why city is called Hoover City?\"\n \n Ben didn't answer.\n \n \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a thousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner, monsieur ?\"\n \n Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n \n \" Ai-yee , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n \n The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n \n Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of faces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him—reddish balloon faces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and occasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a face with a red beard.\n \n A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of a dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n \n He needed help.\n \n But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A reward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The Martian kid, perhaps?\n \n Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of white. He tensed.\n \n Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n \n His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n \n And then he saw another and another and another.\n \n Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a wheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\n \n \n \n\n \n Light showered the room in a dazzling explosion. Ben, half blinded, realized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been turned on.\n \n The light washed away the room's strangeness and its air of brooding wickedness, revealing drab concrete walls and a debris-strewn floor.\n \n Eyes blinked and squinted. There were swift, frightened movements and a chorus of angry murmurs. The patrons of the Blast Inn were like tatter-clad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away.\n \n Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect. His chair tumbled backward, falling.\n \n The white-clad men charged, neuro-clubs upraised.\n \n A woman screamed. The music ceased. The Martian orchestra slunk with feline stealth to a rear exit. Only the giant Venusians remained undisturbed. They stood unmoving, their staring eyes shifting lazily in Ben's direction.\n \n \"Curtis!\" one of the policemen yelled. \"You're covered! Hold it!\"\n \n Ben whirled away from the advancing police, made for the exit into which the musicians had disappeared.\n \n A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air escaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall ahead of him crumbled.\n \n He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the mildly stunning neuro-clubs.\n \n Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit. Another second , his brain screamed. Just another second—\n \n \n Or would the exits be guarded?\n \n He heard the hiss.\n \n It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a slight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle.\n \n \n\n \n He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be growing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny needle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing mortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of his body.\n \n He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He'd have fifteen—maybe twenty—seconds before complete lethargy of mind and body overpowered him.\n \n In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness, he heard a voice yell, \"Turn on the damn lights!\"\n \n Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand. He realized that someone had seized it.\n \n A soft feminine voice spoke to him. \"You're wounded? They hit you?\"\n \n \"Yes.\" His thick lips wouldn't let go of the word.\n \n \"You want to escape—even now?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"You may die if you don't give yourself up.\"\n \n \"No, no.\"\n \n He tried to stumble toward the exit.\n \n \"All right then. Not that way. Here, this way.\"\n \n Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight flicked on.\n \n Hands were guiding him. He was aware of being pushed and pulled. A door closed behind him. The glare of the flashlight faded from his vision—if he still had vision.\n \n \"You're sure?\" the voice persisted.\n \n \"I'm sure,\" Ben managed to say.\n \n \"I have no antidote. You may die.\"\n \n His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection, massage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain within half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to heart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective weapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender at once.\n \n \"Anti ... anti ...\" The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced from his throat. \"No ... I'm sure ... sure.\"\n \n He didn't hear the answer or anything else.\n \n \n\n \n Ben Curtis had no precise sensation of awakening. Return to consciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black nothingness to a dream-like state of awareness.\n \n He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders, hands that massaged, manipulated, fought to restore circulation and sensitivity. He knew they were strong hands. Their strength seemed to transfer itself to his own body.\n \n For a long time, he tried to open his eyes. His lids felt welded shut. But after a while, they opened. His world of darkness gave way to a translucent cloak of mist. A round, featureless shape hovered constantly above him—a face, he supposed.\n \n He tried to talk. Although his lips moved slightly, the only sound was a deep, staccato grunting.\n \n But he heard someone say, \"Don't try to talk.\" It was the same gentle voice he'd heard in the Blast Inn. \"Don't talk. Just lie still and rest. Everything'll be all right.\"\n  Everything all right , he thought dimly.\n \n There were long periods of lethargy when he was aware of nothing. There were periods of light and of darkness. Gradually he grew aware of things. He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spaceman's oxygen mask was clamped over his nose. He felt the heat of electric blankets swathed about his body. Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and he would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach.\n \n Always, it seemed, the face was above him, floating in the obscuring mist. Always, it seemed, the soft voice was echoing in his ears:\n \n \"Swallow this now. That's it. You must have food.\" Or, \"Close your eyes. Don't strain. It won't be long. You're getting better.\"\n  Better , he'd think. Getting better....\n \n \n At last, after one of the periods of lethargy, his eyes opened. The mist brightened, then dissolved.\n \n He beheld the cracked, unpainted ceiling of a small room, its colorless walls broken with a single, round window. He saw the footboard of his aluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket.\n \n Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side.\n \n \"You are better?\" the kind voice asked.\n \n \n\n \n The face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twenty-five and thirty. Her features, devoid of makeup, had an unhealthy-looking pallor, as if she hadn't used a sunlamp for many weeks. Yet, at the same time, her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength. Her straight brown hair was combed backward, tight upon her scalp, and drawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck.\n \n \"I—I am better,\" he murmured. His words were still slow and thick. \"I am going to live?\"\n \n \"You will live.\"\n \n He thought for a moment. \"How long have I been here?\"\n \n \"Nine days.\"\n \n \"You took care of me?\" He noted the deep, dark circles beneath her sleep-robbed eyes.\n \n She nodded.\n \n \"You're the one who carried me when I was shot?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"Why?\"\n \n Suddenly he began to cough. Breath came hard. She held the oxygen mask in readiness. He shook his head, not wanting it.\n \n \"Why?\" he asked again.\n \n \"It would be a long story. Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.\"\n \n A new thought, cloaked in sudden fear, entered his murky consciousness.\n\"Tell me, will—will I be well again? Will I be able to walk?\"\n \n He lay back then, panting, exhausted.\n \n \"You have nothing to worry about,\" the girl said softly. Her cool hand touched his hot forehead. \"Rest. We'll talk later.\"\n \n His eyes closed and breath came easier. He slept.\n \n When he next awoke, his gaze turned first to the window. There was light outside, but he had no way of knowing if this was morning, noon or afternoon—or on what planet.\n \n He saw no white-domed buildings of Hoover City, no formal lines of green-treed parks, no streams of buzzing gyro-cars. There was only a translucent and infinite whiteness. It was as if the window were set on the edge of the Universe overlooking a solemn, silent and matterless void.\n \n The girl entered the room.\n \n \"Hi,\" she said, smiling. The dark half-moons under her eyes were less prominent. Her face was relaxed.\n \n She increased the pressure in his rubberex pillows and helped him rise to a sitting position.\n \n \"Where are we?\" he asked.\n \n \"Venus.\"\n \n \"We're not in Hoover City?\"\n \n \"No.\"\n \n He looked at her, wondering. \"You won't tell me?\"\n \n \"Not yet. Later, perhaps.\"\n \n \"Then how did you get me here? How did we escape from the Inn?\"\n \n \n\n \n She shrugged. \"We have friends who can be bribed. A hiding place in the city, the use of a small desert-taxi, a pass to leave the city—these can be had for a price.\"\n \n \"You'll tell me your name?\"\n \n \"Maggie.\"\n \n \"Why did you save me?\"\n \n Her eyes twinkled mischievously. \"Because you're a good astrogator.\"\n \n His own eyes widened. \"How did you know that?\"\n \n She sat on a plain chair beside his bed. \"I know everything about you, Lieutenant Curtis.\"\n \n \"How did you learn my name? I destroyed all my papers—\"\n \n \"I know that you're twenty-four. Born July 10, 1971. Orphaned at four, you attended Boys Town in the Catskills till you were 19. You graduated from the Academy at White Sands last June with a major in Astrogation. Your rating for the five-year period was 3.8—the second highest in a class of fifty-seven. Your only low mark in the five years was a 3.2 in History of Martian Civilization. Want me to go on?\"\n \n Fascinated, Ben nodded.\n \n \"You were accepted as junior astrogation officer aboard the Odyssey . You did well on your flight from Roswell to Luna City. In a barroom fight in Luna City, you struck and killed a man named Arthur Cobb, a pre-fab salesman. You've been charged with second degree murder and escape. A reward of 5,000 credits has been offered for your capture. You came to Hoover City in the hope of finding a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars. You were looking for them in the Blast Inn.\"\n \n He gaped incredulously, struggling to rise from his pillows. \"I—don't get it.\"\n \n \"There are ways of finding out what we want to know. As I told you, we have many friends.\"\n \n He fell back into his pillows, breathing hard. She rose quickly.\n \n \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have told you yet. I felt so happy because you're alive. Rest now. We'll talk again soon.\"\n \n \"Maggie, you—you said I'd live. You didn't say I'd be able to walk again.\"\n \n She lowered her gaze. \"I hope you'll be able to.\"\n \n \"But you don't think I will, do you?\"\n \n \"I don't know. We'll try walking tomorrow. Don't think about it now. Rest.\"\n \n He tried to relax, but his mind was a vortex of conjecture.\n \n \"Just one more question,\" he almost whispered.\n \n \"Yes?\"\n \n \"The man I killed—did he have a wife?\"\n \n She hesitated. He thought, Damn it, of all the questions, why did I ask that?\n \n \n Finally she said, \"He had a wife.\"\n \n \"Children?\"\n \n \"Two. I don't know their ages.\"\n \n She left the room.\n \n \n\n \n He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side, his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n \n He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n \n The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a merchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly trimmed red beard !\n \n Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into restless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his brain.\n \n The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes accused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n \n And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached down and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and knees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a chilling wail in his ears.\n \n His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice screamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed, the giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping relentlessly toward him.\n \n He awoke still screaming....\n \n A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a question already formed in his mind.\n \n She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n \n She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You were looking for him, weren't you?\"\n \n \"Who is he?\"\n \n She sat on the chair beside him.\n \n \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n \n He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's why you saved me?\"\n \n \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n \n \"Where is he?\"\n \n She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and Pluto. He's building a new base for us—and a home for me. When his ship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n \n \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n \n \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been studying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of Investigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how we operate?\"\n \n He told her the tales he'd heard.\n \n \n\n \n She nodded. \"There are quite a few of us now—about a thousand—and a dozen ships. Our base used to be here on Venus, down toward the Pole. The dome we're in now was designed and built by us a few years ago after we got pushed off Mars. We lost a few men in the construction, but with almost every advance in space, someone dies.\"\n \n \"Venus is getting too civilized. We're moving out and this dome is only a temporary base when we have cases like yours. The new base—I might as well tell you it's going to be an asteroid. I won't say which one.\"\n \n \"Don't get the idea that we're outlaws. Sure, about half our group is wanted by the Bureau, but we make honest livings. We're just people like yourself and Jacob.\"\n \n \"Jacob? Your husband?\"\n \n She laughed. \"Makes you think of a Biblical character, doesn't it? Jacob's anything but that. And just plain 'Jake' reminds one of a grizzled old uranium prospector and he isn't like that, either.\"\n \n She lit a cigarette. \"Anyway, the wanted ones stay out beyond the frontiers. Jacob and those like him can never return to Earth—not even to Hoover City—except dead. The others are physical or psycho rejects who couldn't get clearance if they went back to Earth. They know nothing but rocketing and won't give up. They bring in our ships to frontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.\"\n \n \"Don't the authorities object?\"\n \n \"Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here to search the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carry cargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that's scarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether it comes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives mining it, that's our business.\"\n \n She pursed her lips. \"But if they guessed how strong we are or that we have friends planted in the I. B. I.—well, things might be different. There probably would be a crackdown.\"\n \n Ben scowled. \"What happens if there is a crackdown? And what will you do when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can't ignore you then.\"\n \n \"Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll be pushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won't be the white-suited boys who'll make that first hop to the stars. It could be us, you know—if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder. You can't follow the text-book rules of astrogation out there. You make up your own.\"\n \n \n\n \n Ben stiffened. \"And that's why you want me for an astrogator.\"\n \n Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. \"If you want to come—and if you get well.\" She looked at him strangely.\n \n \"Suppose—\" He fought to find the right words. \"Suppose I got well and decided not to join Jacob. What would happen to me? Would you let me go?\"\n \n Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion—alarm, then bewilderment, then fear. \"I don't know. That would be up to Jacob.\"\n \n He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched his hand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotion that had coursed through her.\n \n \"The only thing that matters, really,\" she murmured, \"is your walking again. We'll try this afternoon. Okay?\"\n \n \"Okay,\" he said.\n \n When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob's photo.\n \n He was like two people, he thought.\n \n Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one single starry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal.\n \n He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when she was alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions:\n \n \"A Space Officer Is Honest\" \"A Space Officer Is Loyal.\" \"A Space Officer Is Dutiful.\"\n \n Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts, mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held it prisoner for half a million years.\n \n Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead, would never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "2418299adb5540d7a8f9d87b9e5e0f01", "response_text": "Ben Curtis enters a dark gin mill followed by the dead man and a boy offers him a wench.

He is approached by a young Martian boy, who brings him to a table where a Martian orchestra plays aside them. In the bar, Ben is anxious and paranoid, particularly upon noticing a few Hoover City police officers. While he sits, Ben is unable to shake the image of a dead man next to him, who is a man named Cobb. Prior to Ben's arrival to Venus, he had stepped into a bar in Luna City, where an intoxicated Cobb was rambling about spacemen and how he despises them. Out of rage and personal offense, Ben punched Cobb in the chin, who died on impact after falling. Ben immediately fled to Venus in search of a red-bearded giant, the leader of a renegade space crew, who was his only hope in survival and job security after the murder. Still seated at the table, the Martian boy continues prodding Ben, who gives him a coin to shoo him off. He soon notices the space policemen from before closing in on him, raising weapons, and he attempts to escape the bar but is shot. Becoming unconscious, Ben hears the voice of a woman, who leads him out of the exit and helps him escape. He then awakes, unable to see clearly, but being cared for and fed. After nine days, he is able to see the woman clearly, who introduces herself as Maggie, and she tells him that they are no longer in Hoover City. She then discloses all the information she has on Ben, including his desire to find the red-bearded man. Ben asks her if Cobb had a wife and kids, which she confirms. As Ben scans the room, he notices a photo of the red-bearded man, and he slips into sleep, where he is again haunted by visions of Cobb. Ben asks Maggie how she knows the man, and she reveals that he is her husband, and that they saved Ben because they were in need of an astrogator. Maggie tells him about the renegade crew, and how they plan on relocating to an asteroid to avoid the authorities. Ben is overwhelmed and fearful of the prospect, but Maggie encourages him to get rest, and he reflects on his future and his duty."}, {"worker_id": "104", "uid": "fb49f598c19b4ab29098294e20cd03a1", "response_text": "The story begins with Ben Curtis, an officer of the Space Corps and astrogator, leaving the Blast Inn on Venus. When he gets to the Venusian gin mill, a Martian kid tries to sell him various things to pique his interest. Ben indicates that he is not interested in any of the offers and the kid eventually leads him to a table that is partially hidden. The location of his table is intentional because he does not want to be seen. Ben becomes deep in thought at the table, intent on finding a man described as having a red beard. \n\nWhile at the table, he also thinks about the events that transpired over the last week when he arrived in Luna City from White Sands. Ben had gone to a bar to celebrate his arrival to Luna City when Cobb drunkenly accosted him. Cobb purposefully tried to anger Ben and eventually was successful in doing so after a particularly poignant threat. In a quick and anger-filled response, Ben struck Cobb causing Cobb to crack his head against the edge of the bar and die. Ben flew to Venus in response to the incident, which explains how he currently arrived in a Venusian bar. \n\nHis thoughts are interrupted when he notices policemen entering the bar. The police quickly find Ben and begin to use deadly neuro-pistols. He begins to run and is eventually hit by one of the blasts from the neuro-pistols. As he realizes he is losing consciousness, an unknown pair of hands guided him towards a different exit. Ben passes out from the blast and wakes up in a room. For 9+ days, he goes in and out of sleep in this room while he recovers from his injuries. Maggie, the woman who helped him escape, is the one helping him recover from his injuries. She knows a lot of information about him and his background. \n\nWhile still recovering, Ben notices that on one side of the bed, there is a picture on a bureau in the far corner of the room that shows a portrait of a red-bearded man. He gets really excited at this new revelation. He asks Maggie about the red-bearded man and she confesses that he is her husband and then explains what he does and why she brought Ben with her. Jacob’s group needs an astrogator and want Ben to join them. While Maggie shows that she would be confused if Ben chose not to join the group, she seems to truly be concerned with his recovery. \n\nWhen Maggie leaves the room, Ben reflects on words found in a book from his childhood that talk about the morals of a Space Officer. He acknowledges how very few are able to get the job in the SpaceCorps. The story ends with implications that Ben will choose his moral values and choose not to join Jacob’s group. \n"}]}, {"question_text": "Describe the setting of the story.", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "2418299adb5540d7a8f9d87b9e5e0f01", "response_text": "The story begins in the Blast Inn, a dim gin mill with a sense of evil.

And it would get you there—as long as you weren't going anywhere anyhow!\n \n \n By H. B. FYFE\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Johnny Tolliver scowled across the desk at his superior. His black thatch was ruffled, as if he had been rubbed the wrong way.\n \n \"I didn't ask you to cut out your own graft, did I?\" he demanded.\n\"Just don't try to sucker me in on the deal. I know you're operating something sneaky all through the colony, but it's not for me.\"\n \n The big moon-face of Jeffers, manager of the Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways, glowered back at him. Its reddish tinge brightened the office noticeably, for such of Ganymede's surface as could be seen through the transparent dome outside the office window was cold, dim and rugged. The glowing semi-disk of Jupiter was more than half a million miles distant.\n \n \"Try not to be simple—for once!\" growled Jeffers. \"A little percentage here and there on the cargoes never shows by the time figures get back to Earth. The big jets in the home office don't care. They count it on the estimates.\"\n \n \"You asked any of them lately?\" Tolliver prodded.\n \n \"Now, listen ! Maybe they live soft back on Earth since the mines and the Jovian satellite colonies grew; but they were out here in the beginning, most of them. They know what it's like. D'ya think they don't expect us to make what we can on the side?\"\n \n Tolliver rammed his fists into the side pockets of his loose blue uniform jacket. He shook his head, grinning resignedly.\n \n \"You just don't listen to me ,\" he complained. \"You know I took this piloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degree back on Earth. I only want to finish my year—not get into something I can't quit.\"\n \n Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, causing it to creak under the bulk of his body. It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers.\n \n \"Aw, it's not like that,\" the manager muttered. \"You can ease out whenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on your account?\"\n \n Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meeting his eye.\n \n \"All right, then!\" Jeffers snapped after a long moment. \"If you want it that way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!\"\n \n \"You can't fire me,\" retorted the pilot pityingly. \"I came out here on a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred for hazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?\"\n \n \"Okay I can't fire you legally—as long as you report for work,\" grumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. \"We'll see how long you keep reporting. Because you're off the Callisto run as of now! Sit in your quarters and see if the company calls that hazardous duty!\"\n \n \"Doesn't matter,\" answered Tolliver, grinning amiably. \"The hazardous part is just being on the same moon as you for the next six months.\"\n \n He winked and walked out, deliberately leaving the door open behind him so as to enjoy the incoherent bellowing that followed him.\n  Looks like a little vacation , he thought, unperturbed. He'll come around. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffers and his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It's their risk.\n \n \n \n\n \n Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was \"Tuesday\" by the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-long journey around Jupiter.\n \n His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected to specify the type of craft to be piloted.\n \n On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the number of one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and the spaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes.\n \n He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around the garage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domes seemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.\n \n The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He swore when he found the assignment unchanged by \"Friday.\" Even the reflection that it was payday was small consolation.\n \n \"Hey, Johnny!\" said a voice at his shoulder. \"The word is that they're finally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.\"\n \n Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.\n \n \"What do you mean?\"\n \n \"They say some home-office relative is coming in on the Javelin .\"\n \n \"What's wrong with that?\" asked Tolliver. \"Outside of the way they keep handing out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.\"\n \n \"Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can go back to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reason but them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economy orbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!\"\n \n Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under a portable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship's airlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bags into the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage at the waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.\n \n She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly even in stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade too blonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the cap apparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavy sweater, like a spacer.\n \n \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" she said, sliding into the seat beside Tolliver. \"By the way, just call me Betty.\"\n \n \"Sure,\" agreed Tolliver thinking, Ohmigod! Trying already to be just one of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer, or does he just know where bodies are buried?\n \n \n \"They were making dates,\" said the girl. \"Were they ribbing me, or is it true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?\"\n \n \"It's true enough,\" Tolliver assured her. \"We need people out here, and it costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loaded ships by 'automatic' flight—that is, a long, slow, economical orbit and automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approaching Earth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their time making the entire trip.\"\n \n \n\n \n He followed the signals of a spacesuited member of the port staff and maneuvered out of the dome. Then he headed the tractor across the frozen surface of Ganymede toward the permanent domes of the city.\n \n \"How is it here?\" asked the girl. \"They told me it's pretty rough.\"\n \n \"What did you expect?\" asked Tolliver. \"Square dances with champagne?\"\n \n \"Don't be silly. Daddy says I'm supposed to learn traffic routing and the business management of a local branch. They probably won't let me see much else.\"\n \n \"You never can tell,\" said the pilot, yielding to temptation. \"Any square inch of Ganymede is likely to be dangerous.\"\n  I'll be sorry later , he reflected, but if Jeffers keeps me jockeying this creeper, I'm entitled to some amusement. And Daddy's little girl is trying too hard to sound like one of the gang.\n \n \n \"Yeah,\" he went on, \"right now, I don't do a thing but drive missions from the city to the spaceport.\"\n \n \"Missions! You call driving a mile or so a mission ?\"\n \n Tolliver pursed his lips and put on a shrewd expression.\n \n \"Don't sneer at Ganymede, honey!\" he warned portentously. \"Many a man who did isn't here today. Take the fellow who used to drive this mission!\"\n \n \"You can call me Betty. What happened to him?\"\n \n \"I'll tell you some day,\" Tolliver promised darkly. \"This moon can strike like a vicious animal.\"\n \n \"Oh, they told me there was nothing alive on Ganymede!\"\n \n \"I was thinking of the mountain slides,\" said the pilot. \"Not to mention volcanic puffballs that pop out through the frozen crust where you'd least expect. That's why I draw such high pay for driving an unarmored tractor.\"\n \n \"You use armored vehicles?\" gasped the girl.\n \n She was now sitting bolt upright in the swaying seat. Tolliver deliberately dipped one track into an icy hollow. In the light gravity, the tractor responded with a weird, floating lurch.\n \n \"Those slides,\" he continued. \"Ganymede's only about the size of Mercury, something like 3200 miles in diameter, so things get heaped up at steep angles. When the rock and ice are set to sliding, they come at you practically horizontally. It doesn't need much start, and it barrels on for a long way before there's enough friction to stop it. If you're in the way—well, it's just too bad!\"\n  Say, that's pretty good! he told himself. What a liar you are, Tolliver!\n \n \n He enlarged upon other dangers to be encountered on the satellite, taking care to impress the newcomer with the daredeviltry of John Tolliver, driver of \"missions\" across the menacing wastes between dome and port.\n \n In the end, he displayed conclusive evidence in the form of the weekly paycheck he had received that morning. It did not, naturally, indicate he was drawing the salary of a space pilot. Betty looked thoughtful.\n \n \"I'm retiring in six months if I'm still alive,\" he said bravely, edging the tractor into the airlock at their destination. \"Made my pile. No use pushing your luck too far.\"\n \n His charge seemed noticeably subdued, but cleared her throat to request that Tolliver guide her to the office of the manager. She trailed along as if with a burden of worry upon her mind, and the pilot's conscience prickled.\n  I'll get hold of her after Jeffers is through and set her straight , he resolved. It isn't really funny if the sucker is too ignorant to know better.\n \n \n \n\n \n Remembering his grudge against the manager, he took pleasure in walking in without knocking.\n \n \"Jeffers,\" he announced, \"this is ... just call her Betty.\"\n \n The manager's jowled features twisted into an expression of welcome as jovial as that of a hungry crocodile.\n \n \"Miss Koslow!\" he beamed, like a politician the day before the voting.\n\"It certainly is an honor to have you on Ganymede with us! That's all, Tolliver, you can go. Yes, indeed! Mr. Koslow—the president, that is: your father—sent a message about you. I repeat, it will be an honor to show you the ropes. Did you want something else, Tolliver?\"\n \n \"Never mind him, Mr. Jeffers,\" snapped the girl, in a tone new to Tolliver. \"We won't be working together, I'm afraid. You've already had enough rope.\"\n \n Jeffers seemed to stagger standing still behind his desk. His loose lips twitched uncertainly, and he looked questioningly to Tolliver. The pilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of the elder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of the lies he had told en route from the spaceport.\n \n \"Wh-wh-what do you mean, Miss Koslow?\" Jeffers stammered.\n \n He darted a suspicious glare at Tolliver.\n \n \"Mr. Jeffers,\" said the girl, \"I may look like just another spoiled little blonde, but the best part of this company will be mine someday. I was not allowed to reach twenty-two without learning something about holding on to it.\"\n \n Tolliver blinked. He had taken her for three or four years older. Jeffers now ignored him, intent upon the girl.\n \n \"Daddy gave me the title of tenth vice-president mostly as a joke, when he told me to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede. I have some authority, though. And you look like the source of the trouble to me.\"\n \n \"You can't prove anything,\" declared Jeffers hoarsely.\n \n \"Oh, can't I? I've already seen certain evidence, and the rest won't be hard to find. Where are your books, Mr. Jeffers? You're as good as fired!\"\n \n The manager dropped heavily to his chair. He stared unbelievingly at Betty, and Tolliver thought he muttered something about \"just landed.\" After a moment, the big man came out of his daze enough to stab an intercom button with his finger. He growled at someone on the other end to come in without a countdown.\n \n Tolliver, hardly thinking about it, expected the someone to be a secretary, but it turned out to be three members of Jeffers' headquarters staff. He recognized one as Rawlins, a warehouse chief, and guessed that the other two might be his assistants. They were large enough.\n \n \"No stupid questions!\" Jeffers ordered. \"Lock these two up while I think!\"\n \n Tolliver started for the door immediately, but was blocked off.\n \n \"Where should we lock—?\" the fellow paused to ask.\n \n Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the man's chin, feeling that it was a poor time to engage Jeffers in fruitless debate.\n \n In the gravity of Ganymede, the man was knocked off balance as much as he was hurt, and sprawled on the floor.\n \n \"I told you no questions!\" bawled Jeffers.\n \n The fallen hero, upon arising, had to content himself with grabbing Betty. The others were swarming over Tolliver. Jeffers came around his desk to assist.\n \n \n\n \n Tolliver found himself dumped on the floor of an empty office in the adjoining warehouse building. It seemed to him that a long time had been spent in carrying him there.\n \n He heard an indignant yelp, and realized that the girl had been pitched in with him. The snapping of a lock was followed by the tramp of departing footsteps and then by silence.\n \n After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up.\n \n He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind his left ear, a sensation befuddled him momentarily.\n \n \"I'm sorry about that,\" murmured Betty.\n \n Tolliver grunted. Sorrow would not reduce the throbbing, nor was he in a mood to undertake an explanation of why Jeffers did not like him anyway.\n \n \"I think perhaps you're going to have a shiner,\" remarked the girl.\n \n \"Thanks for letting me know in time,\" said Tolliver.\n \n The skin under his right eye did feel a trifle tight, but he could see well enough. The abandoned and empty look of the office worried him.\n \n \"What can we use to get out of here?\" he mused.\n \n \"Why should we try?\" asked the girl. \"What can he do?\"\n \n \"You'd be surprised. How did you catch on to him so soon?\"\n \n \"Your paycheck,\" said Betty. \"As soon as I saw that ridiculous amount, it was obvious that there was gross mismanagement here. It had to be Jeffers.\"\n \n Tolliver groaned.\n \n \"Then, on the way over here, he as good as admitted everything. You didn't hear him, I guess. Well, he seemed to be caught all unaware, and seemed to blame you for it.\"\n \n \"Sure!\" grumbled the pilot. \"He thinks I told you he was grafting or smuggling, or whatever he has going for him here. That's why I want to get out of here—before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal accident!\"\n \n \"What do you know about the crooked goings-on here?\" asked Betty after a startled pause.\n \n \"Nothing,\" retorted Tolliver. \"Except that there are some. There are rumors, and I had a halfway invitation to join in. I think he sells things to the mining colonies and makes a double profit for himself by claiming the stuff lost in transit. You didn't think you scared him that bad over a little slack managing?\"\n \n The picture of Jeffers huddled with his partners in the headquarters building, plotting the next move, brought Tolliver to his feet.\n \n There was nothing in the unused office but an old table and half a dozen plastic crates. He saw that the latter contained a mess of discarded records.\n \n \"Better than nothing at all,\" he muttered.\n \n He ripped out a double handful of the forms, crumpled them into a pile at the doorway, and pulled out his cigarette lighter.\n \n \"What do you think you're up to?\" asked Betty with some concern.\n \n \"This plastic is tough,\" said Tolliver, \"but it will bend with enough heat. If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\"\n \n He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with more papers.\n \n \"You know,\" he reflected, \"it might be better for you to stay here. He can't do much about you, and you don't have any real proof just by yourself.\"\n \n \"I'll come along with you, Tolliver,\" said the girl.\n \n \"No, I don't think you'd better.\"\n \n \"Why not?\"\n \n \"Well ... after all, what would he dare do? Arranging an accident to the daughter of the boss isn't something that he can pull off without a lot of investigation. He'd be better off just running for it.\"\n \n \"Let's not argue about it,\" said Betty, a trifle pale but looking determined. \"I'm coming with you. Is that stuff getting soft yet?\"\n \n Tolliver kicked at the edge of the door experimentally. It seemed to give slightly, so he knocked the burning papers aside and drove his heel hard at the corner below the hinge.\n \n The plastic yielded.\n \n \"That's enough already, Tolliver,\" whispered the girl. \"We can crawl through!\"\n \n \n\n \n Hardly sixty seconds later, he led her into a maze of stacked crates in the warehouse proper. The building was not much longer than wide, for each of the structures in the colony had its own hemispherical emergency dome of transparent plastic. They soon reached the other end.\n \n \"I think there's a storeroom for spacesuits around here,\" muttered Tolliver.\n \n \"Why do you want them?\"\n \n \"Honey, I just don't think it will be so easy to lay hands on a tractor. I bet Jeffers already phoned the garage and all the airlocks with some good lie that will keep me from getting through.\"\n \n After a brief search, he located the spacesuits. Many, evidently intended for replacements, had never been unpacked, but there were a dozen or so serviced and standing ready for emergencies. He showed Betty how to climb into one, and checked her seals and valves after donning a suit himself.\n \n \"That switch under your chin,\" he said, touching helmets so she could hear him. \"Leave it turned off. Anybody might be listening!\"\n \n He led the way out a rear door of the warehouse. With the heavy knife that was standard suit equipment, he deliberately slashed a four-foot square section out of the dome. He motioned to Betty to step through, then trailed along with the plastic under his arm.\n \n He caught up and touched helmets again.\n \n \"Just act as if you're on business,\" he told her. \"For all anyone can see, we might be inspecting the dome.\"\n \n \"Where are you going?\" asked Betty.\n \n \"Right through the wall, and then head for the nearest mine. Jeffers can't be running everything !\"\n \n \"Is there any way to get to a TV?\" asked the girl. \"I ... uh ... Daddy gave me a good number to call if I needed help.\"\n \n \"How good?\"\n \n \"Pretty official, as a matter of fact.\"\n \n \"All right,\" Tolliver decided. \"We'll try the ship you just came in on. They might have finished refueling and left her empty.\"\n \n They had to cross one open lane between buildings, and Tolliver was very conscious of moving figures in the distance; but no one seemed to look their way.\n \n Reaching the foot of the main dome over the establishment, he glanced furtively about, then plunged his knife into the transparent material.\n \n From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Betty make a startled gesture, but he had his work cut out for him. This was tougher than the interior dome.\n \n Finally, he managed to saw a ragged slit through which they could squeeze. There was room to walk between the inner and outer layer, so he moved along a few yards. A little dust began to blow about where they had gone through. He touched helmets once more.\n \n \"This time,\" he said, \"the air will really start to blow, so get through as fast as you can. If I can slap this piece of plastic over the rip, it may stow down the loss of pressure enough to give us quite a lead before the alarms go off.\"\n \n Through the faceplates, he saw the girl nod, wide-eyed.\n \n As soon as he plunged the knife into the outer layer, he could see dusty, moist air puffing out into the near-vacuum of Ganymede's surface. Fumbling, he cut as fast as he could and shoved Betty through the small opening.\n \n Squeezing through in his turn, he left one arm inside to spread the plastic sheet as best he could. The internal air pressure slapped it against the inside of the dome as if glued, although it immediately showed an alarming tendency to balloon through the ruptured spot.\n  They'll find it, all right , Tolliver reminded himself. Don't be here when they do!\n \n \n He grabbed Betty by the wrist of her spacesuit and headed for the nearest outcropping of rock.\n \n It promptly developed that she had something to learn about running on ice in such low gravity. Until they were out of direct line of sight from the settlement, Tolliver simply dragged her.\n \n Then, when he decided that it was safe enough to pause and tell her how to manage better, the sight of her outraged scowl through the face-plate made him think better of it.\n  By the time we reach the ship, she'll have learned , he consoled himself.\n \n \n\n \n It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve on Ganymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forced to explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. He admitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached the spaceship.\n \n There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsed and stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed.\n \n \"That's all right,\" Tolliver told the girl. \"We can get in with no trouble.\"\n \n It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved that he caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at the spot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognized the outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tilting downward again.\n \n \"In fact, we have to get in to stay out of trouble,\" he said to Betty.\n \n He located the switch-cover in the hull, opened it and activated the mechanism that swung open the airlock and extended the ladder.\n \n It took him considerable scrambling to boost the girl up the ladder and inside, but he managed. They passed through the airlock, fretting at the time required to seal, pump air and open the inner hatch; and then Tolliver led the way up another ladder to the control room. It was a clumsy trip in their spacesuits, but he wanted to save time.\n \n \n\n \n In the control room, he shoved the girl into an acceleration seat, glanced at the gauges and showed her how to open her helmet.\n \n \"Leave the suit on,\" he ordered, getting in the first word while she was still shaking her head. \"It will help a little on the takeoff.\"\n \n \"Takeoff!\" shrilled Betty. \"What do you think you're going to do? I just want to use the radio or TV!\"\n \n \"That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut your conversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over these dials!\"\n \n He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of the ship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into an economy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments, doing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. He warned her the trip might be long.\n \n \"I told you not to come,\" he said at last. \"Now sit back!\"\n \n He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process.\n \n In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck, and then it was out of his hands for several minutes.\n \n \"That wasn't so bad,\" Betty admitted some time later. \"Did you go in the right direction?\"\n \n \"Who knows?\" retorted Tolliver. \"There wasn't time to check everything . We'll worry about that after we make your call.\"\n \n \"Oh!\" Betty looked helpless. \"It's in my pocket.\"\n \n Tolliver sighed. In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pry her out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed any further help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter. When Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set about making contact.\n \n It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitored expectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore a uniform.\n \n \"Space Patrol?\" whispered Tolliver incredulously.\n \n \"That's right,\" said Betty. \"Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.\"\n \n Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float out of range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he stared exasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man who could arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede and wondering what was behind it all.\n \n When he heard Betty requesting assistance in arresting Jeffers and reporting the manager as the head of a ring of crooks, he began to suspect. He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of the Patrolman.\n \n \n\n \n For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, he never addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted the request as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who to go down after.\n  They really sent her out to nail someone , Tolliver realized. Of course, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had an idea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She might have got me killed!\n \n \n \"We do have one trouble,\" he heard Betty saying. \"This tractor driver, Tolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but he says it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever they call it. I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.\"\n \n Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of her sweater.\n \n \"Actually, I have a fine idea,\" he informed the officer coldly. \"I happen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control. If Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us later on this channel.\"\n \n \"Miss Koslow?\" repeated the spacer. \"Did she tell you—well, no matter! If you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.\"\n \n He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offended than reassured at discovering his status.\n \n \"This 'Miss Koslow' business,\" he said suspiciously. \"He sounded funny about that.\"\n \n The girl grinned.\n \n \"Relax, Tolliver,\" she told him. \"Did you really believe Daddy would send his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoever was gypping him?\"\n \n \"You ... you...?\"\n \n \"Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigating firm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate—\"\n \n \"I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,\" Tolliver finished for her. \"I guess it's better this way,\" he said meditatively a moment later.\n \n \"Oh, come on ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we're going?\"\n \n \"I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, so we'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to be picked up.\"\n \n He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuel necessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Even though the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringing along enough fuel to head back would be something else again.\n \n \"We'll just have to ride it out,\" he said sympathetically. \"The ship is provisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.\"\n \n \"I didn't expect to so soon.\"\n \n \"Yeah, you were pretty lucky. They'll think you're a marvel to crack the case in about three hours on Ganymede.\"\n \n \"Great!\" muttered Betty. \"What a lucky girl I am!\"\n \n \"Yes,\" admitted Tolliver, \"there are problems. If you like, we might get the captain of that Patrol ship to legalize the situation by TV.\"\n \n \"I can see you're used to sweeping girls off their feet,\" she commented sourly.\n \n \"The main problem is whether you can cook.\"\n \n Betty frowned at him.\n \n \"I'm pretty good with a pistol,\" she offered, \"or going over crooked books. But cook? Sorry.\"\n \n \"Well, one of us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.\"\n \n \"I'll think about it,\" promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at the deck.\n \n Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about it too.\n  After a while , he promised himself, I'll explain how I cut the fuel flow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're just orbiting Ganymede!", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "103", "uid": "8c343deb053741e1aa02ad9c0ef26824", "response_text": "The story begins as Johnny Tolliver argues with Jeffers, the manager of Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways, about how he doesn’t want to be involved with whatever he is doing.

For the next few days Johnny has nothing to do as he is made to drive a tractor and doesn't have any assignments. Then he gets word he will be assigned to drive a tractor with some home-office relative, who has a lot of bags as a cargo, which is a simple waste of fuel.

He'd never make it unless he somehow managed to\n \n\n PICK A CRIME\n \n \n By RICHARD R. SMITH\n \n Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction May 1958. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n The girl was tall, wide-eyed and brunette. She had the right curves in the right places and would have been beautiful if her nose had been smaller, if her mouth had been larger and if her hair had been wavy instead of straight.\n \n \"Hank said you wanted to see me,\" she said when she stopped beside Joe's table.\n \n \"Yeah.\" Joe nodded at the other chair. \"Have a seat.\" He reached into a pocket, withdrew five ten-dollar bills and handed them to her. \"I want you to do a job for me. It'll only take a few minutes.\"\n \n The girl counted the money, then placed it in her purse. Joe noticed a small counterfeit-detector inside the purse before she closed it.\n\"What's the job?\"\n \n \"Tell you later.\" He gulped the remainder of his drink, almost pouring it down his throat.\n \n \"Hey. You trying to make yourself sick?\"\n \n \"Not sick. Drunk. Been trying to get drunk all afternoon.\" As the liquor settled in his stomach, he waited for the warm glow. But the glow didn't come ... the bartender had watered his drink again.\n \n \"Trying to get drunk?\" the girl inquired. \"Are you crazy?\"\n \n \"No. It's simple. If I get drunk, I can join the AAA and get free room and board for a month while they give me a treatment.\"\n \n It was easy enough to understand, he reflected, but a lot harder to do. The CPA robot bartenders saw to it that anyone got high if they wanted, but comparatively few got drunk. Each bartender could not only mix drinks but could also judge by a man's actions and speech when he was on the verge of drunkenness. At the proper time—since drunkenness was illegal—a bartender always watered the drinks.\n \n Joe had tried dozens of times in dozens of bars to outsmart them, but had always failed. And in all of New York's millions, there had been only a hundred cases of intoxication during the previous year.\n \n The girl laughed. \"If you're that hard up, I don't know if I should take this fifty or not. Why don't you go out and get a job like everyone else?\"\n \n As an answer, Joe handed her his CPA ID card. She grunted when she saw the large letters that indicated the owner had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies.\n \n \n\n \n When she handed the card back, Joe fought an impulse to tear it to pieces. He'd done that once and gone through a mountain of red tape to get another—everyone was required by law to carry a CPA ID card and show it upon request.\n \n \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I didn't know you were a DCT.\"\n \n \"And who'll hire a guy with criminal tendencies? You know the score. When you try to get a job, they ask to see your ID before they even tell you if there's an opening or not. If your CPA ID says you're a DCT, you're SOL and they tell you there's no openings. Oh, I've had several jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I've been a garbage man, street-cleaner, ditch-digger—\"\n \n On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and a group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor.\n \n Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned across the table and whispered in the girl's ear, \"That's what I want to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get convicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!\"\n \n The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. \"Say! You really got big plans, don't you?\"\n \n He smiled at her admiration. It was something big to plan a crime. A civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting, blackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA—Crime Prevention Association. There were no longer any prisons—CPA officials had declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent crime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of ingenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime almost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.\n \n No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill someone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; he wasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all criminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few criminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city could afford the CPA hospitals.\n \n The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because it did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with prisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.\n \n And, ironically, a man who did commit a crime was a sort of hero. He was a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses to kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a hero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was—when he left one of the CPA hospitals—a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a man who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money. And therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatment was commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of the word an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.\n \n \"Well,\" the girl said. \"I'm honored. Really. But I got a date at ten. Let's get it over with. You said it'd only take a few minutes.\"\n \n \"Okay. Let's go.\"\n \n \n\n \n The girl followed him across the room, around tables, through a door, down a hall, through a back door and into the alley.\n \n She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and ripped her blouse and skirt.\n \n He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away, her body poised like a wrestler's. \"What's the big idea?\"\n \n \"Scream,\" Joe said. \"Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you.\"\n \n The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of the few things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime because it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the intended victim—and because millions of women voters had voted it a crime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc., were not crimes. They weren't crimes because the DCT didn't complete the act, and if he didn't complete the act, that meant simply that the CPA had once again functioned properly.\n \n The girl shook her head vigorously. \"Sorry, buddy. Can't help you that way. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?\"\n \n \"What's the matter?\" Joe complained. \"I'm not asking you to do anything wrong.\"\n \n \"You stupid jerk. What do you think this is—the Middle Ages? Don't you know almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I'm a sergeant in the WSDA!\"\n \n Joe groaned. The WSDA—Women's Self-Defense Association—a branch of the CPA. The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, even developed new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women in those new techniques.\n \n The girl was still shaking her head. \"Can't do it, buddy. I'd lose my rank if you were convicted of—\"\n \n \"Do I have to make you scream?\" Joe inquired tiredly and advanced toward the girl.\n \n \"—and that rank carries a lot of weight. Hey! Stop it! \"\n \n Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth when she said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body, and in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air.\n \n \n\n \n The alley's concrete floor was hard—it had always been hard, but he became acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it. There was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautiful stars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant police sirens. But the wonderful moment didn't last long and darkness closed in on him.\n \n \n\n \n When he awoke, a rough voice was saying, \"Okay. Snap out of it.\"\n \n He opened his eyes and recognized the police commissioner's office. It would be hard not to recognize: the room was large, devoid of furniture except for a desk and chairs, but the walls were lined with the controls of television screens, electronic calculators and a hundred other machines that formed New York's mechanical police force.\n \n Commissioner Hendricks was a remarkable character. There was something wrong with his glands, and he was a huge, greasy bulk of a man with bushy eyebrows and a double chin. His steel-gray eyes showed something of his intelligence and he would have gone far in politics if fate hadn't made him so ugly, for more than half the voters who elected men to high political positions were women.\n \n Anyone who knew Hendricks well liked him, for he was a friendly, likable person. But the millions of women voters who saw his face on posters and on their TV screens saw only the ugly face and heard only the harsh voice. The President of the United States was a capable man, but also a very handsome one, and the fact that a man who looked something like a bulldog had been elected as New York's police commissioner was a credit to Hendricks and millions of women voters.\n \n \"Where's the girl?\" Joe asked.\n \n \"I processed her while you were out cold. She left. Joe, you—\"\n \n \"Okay,\" Joe said. \"I'll save you the trouble. I admit it. Attempted rape. I confess.\"\n \n Hendricks smiled. \"Sorry, Joe. You missed the boat again.\" He reached out and turned a dial on his desk top. \"We had a microphone hidden in that alley. We have a lot of microphones hidden in a lot of alleys. You'd be surprised at the number of conspiracies that take place in alleys!\"\n \n Joe listened numbly to his voice as it came from one of the hundreds of machines on the walls, \" Scream. Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you. \" And then the girl's voice, \" Sorry, buddy. Can't help— \"\n \n He waved his hand. \"Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.\"\n \n \n\n \n Hendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was slouched in a chair. \"Give me your CPA ID.\"\n \n Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world had collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime. Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from committing a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly once again. That meant the CPA had once again prevented crime, and the CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attempt to prevent crimes by punishment. If it did, that would be a violation of the New Civil Rights.\n \n Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a button. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.\n \n When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words DANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before. And, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a DCT First Class.\n \n \"You've graduated,\" Hendricks said coldly. \"You guys never learn, do you? Now you're a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know what that means?\"\n \n Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face.\n\"That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers. You'll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it works? It's like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night and they're bored. Then Mr. Jones says, 'Let's go watch this Joe Harper.' So they look up your record—amateur cops always keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks—and they see that you stop frequently at Walt's Tavern.\n \n \"So they go there and they sit and drink and watch you, trying not to let you know they're watching you. They watch you all night, just hoping you'll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone, so they can be the first ones to yell ' Police! ' They'll watch you because it's exciting to be an amateur cop, and if they ever did prevent you from committing a crime, they'd get a nice reward and they'd be famous.\"\n \n \"Lay off,\" Joe said. \"I got a headache. That girl—\"\n \n Hendricks leaned even closer and glared. \"You listen, Joe. This is interesting. You see, it doesn't stop with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There's thousands of people like them. Years ago, they got their kicks from reading about guys like you, but these days things are dull because it's rare when anyone commits a crime. So every time you walk down the street, there'll be at least a dozen of 'em following you, and no matter where you go, you can bet there'll be some of 'em sitting next to you, standing next to you.\n \n \"During the day, they'll take your picture with their spy cameras that look like buttons on their coats. At night, they'll peep at you through your keyhole. Your neighbors across the street will watch you through binoculars and—\"\n \n \"Lay off!\"\n \n \n\n \n Joe squirmed in the chair. He'd been lectured by Hendricks before and it was always an unpleasant experience. The huge man was like a talking machine once he got started, a machine that couldn't be stopped.\n \n \"And the kids are the worst,\" Hendricks continued. \"They have Junior CPA clubs. They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboard boxes. They'll stare at you on the street and stare at you through restaurant windows while you're eating meals. They'll follow you in public rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyes while they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you look back, you'll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half a block behind, giggling and gaping at you. They'll follow you until the day you die, because you're a freak!\"\n \n Joe couldn't stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and paced the floor.\n \n \"And it doesn't end there , Joe. It goes on and on. You'll be the object of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stop you on the street and say, 'I'd like to help you, friend.' Then they'll ask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you were a child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT First Class?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stop you on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and—\"\n \n \"Okay, goddam it! Stop it! \"\n \n Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief and lit a cigarette.\n \n \"I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm trying to explain something you're too dumb to realize by yourself. We've taught everyone to hate crime and criminals ... to hate them as nothing has ever been hated before. Today a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hell if you don't leave New York. You should go to some small town where there aren't many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or—\"\n \n Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously. \" Favor , did you say? The day you do me a favor—\"\n \n Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. \"Not entirely a favor. I want to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and read books. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.\"\n \n \"I couldn't leave if I wanted to,\" Joe said. \"I'm flat broke. Thanks to your CPA system, a DCT can't get a decent job.\"\n \n \n\n \n Hendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extended them. \"I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back a little at a time.\"\n \n Joe waved the money away. \"Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Why don't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me—any crime.\"\n \n \"Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is a violation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.\"\n \n \"Umm.\"\n \n \"Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't have to be a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all your criminal tendencies and—\"\n \n \"Go to those head-shrinkers ?\"\n \n Hendricks shrugged again. \"Have it your way.\"\n \n Joe laughed. \"If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you make me go?\"\n \n \"Violation of Civil Rights.\"\n \n \"Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the same thing. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.\"\n \n \"How can I help you without committing a crime myself?\" Hendricks walked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.\n\"See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in New York who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people who aren't protected properly—blind spots in our protection devices. As soon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices, but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.\n \n \"In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can I do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe, pick a name and go out and rob him.'\" He laughed nervously. \"If I did that, I'd be committing a crime myself!\"\n \n He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket again and wiped sweat from his face. \"Excuse me a minute. I'm dying of thirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.\"\n \n Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the big man. Hendricks was—unbelievably—offering him a victim, offering him a crime!\n \n Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name and address and memorized it: John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.\n \n \n When Hendricks came back, Joe said, \"Thanks.\"\n \n \"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.\"\n \n \n\n \n When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a child, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid of the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill at ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his own imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the feeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake.\n \n Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went. Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns, alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited for someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked up was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n \n If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they were discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received, the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene in two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden microphones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages to the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in someone's pocket at forty yards.\n \n Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery store was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place of business for years.\n \n Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors—devices placed in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had made poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing poison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount of it would kill a human.\n \n The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the supervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think of kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was pointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place of business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors that could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n \n And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance of the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled that he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were different: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and their aim was infallible.\n \n \n\n \n It was like a fantastic dream come true. Only the dream wasn't fantastic any more. With the huge atomic power plants scattered across the country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously low prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power required to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of four dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of the devices had cost even less.\n \n And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at the individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio or watching television, if a person heard station identification, he invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH. If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters declaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he always found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit anything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.\n \n It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and heard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.\n \n Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands of other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment\n204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine.\n \n The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204, he could see that the wall on either side of it was new . That is, instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls were, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and the owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating another room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by law, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but evidently he didn't want to pay for installation.\n \n When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to close the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the bed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at night and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.\n \n Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the crime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.\n \n \n\n \n He broke out in a sweat when he found nothing but underwear and old magazines. If he stole underwear and magazines, it would still be a crime, but the newspapers would splash satirical headlines. Instead of being respected as a successful criminal, he would be ridiculed.\n \n He stopped sweating when he found a watch under a pile of underwear. The crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn't run, but—perfection itself—engraved on the back was the inscription, To John with Love . His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy for the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed.\n \n Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, \" Thief! Police! Help! \"\n \n He waited a few seconds and then ran. When he reached the street, a police helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him; cameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence.\n \n When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the metal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who reported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning.\n \n \n\n \n He was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, \"Hey. Wake up. Hey!\"\n \n He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks' ugly face and thought for a minute he was still having the nightmare.\n \n \"I just saw your doctor,\" Hendricks said. \"He says your treatment is over. You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.\"\n \n As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.\n \n During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to think. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in himself.\n \n He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be an after-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed when he looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months and he had, between operations, been locked in his room.\n \n Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back. Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change: Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now, even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred. They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it altogether.\n \n \"Come here and take a look at your public,\" said Hendricks.\n \n Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered on the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks, cameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day. But now—another change in him—\n \n He put the emotion into words: \"I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I don't.\"\n \n \"Hero!\" Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded like a bull snorting. \"You think a successful criminal is a hero? You stupid—\"\n \n He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. \"You think those people are down there because they admire what you did? They're down there waiting for you because they're curious, because they're glad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You're an ex -criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never be able to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kind of guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get your autograph.\"\n \n Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did understand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see the people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero, what was he ?\n \n \n\n \n It took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all around him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at once and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered some more.\n \n Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired old lady with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank heaven it was only a watch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son.\" And then the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total confusion.\n \n What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone rather than stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd would have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA hospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an ex-murderer came out.\n \n In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled himself with the thought, People are funny. Who can understand 'em?\n \n \n Feeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned toward Hendricks and said, \"Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I'll be able to get a good job now.\"\n \n \"That's why I met you at the hospital,\" Hendricks said. \"I want to explain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you're spectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself and I don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did you a favor.\"\n \n Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely thanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'd done him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!\n \n \"You robbed Gralewski's apartment,\" Hendricks said. \"Gralewski is a CPA employee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA pays the rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of places like that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like you before they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT First Class won't take the free psycho treatment or—\"\n \n \"Well, it's still a favor.\"\n \n Hendricks' face hardened. \"Favor? You wouldn't know a favor if you stumbled over one. I did it because it's standard procedure for your type of case. Anyone can—free of charge—have treatment by the best psychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for the treatment and taking it. But you wouldn't do that. You wanted to commit a crime, get caught and be a hero ... an Ex .\"\n \n \n\n \n The car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ages were laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPA psychologists to relieve tension. And—despite the treatment, Joe shuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietly watching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employees and volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly watching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies, it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply until it took you apart and put you back together again the way it wanted you to be.\n \n \"Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted,\" Hendricks continued. \"You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it. You'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever worked before in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice in your head is going to say, Work! Work! Exes always get good jobs because employers know they're good workers.\n \n \"But during these next few days, you'll discover what being an Ex is like. You see, Joe, the treatment can't possibly take all the criminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next best thing—you'll find a set of laws written in your mind. You might want to break one now and then, but you won't be able. I'll give you an illustration....\"\n \n Joe's face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series of names. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles in his arm froze before it moved it an inch.\n \n And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain so intense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed in agony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head, Unlawful to strike someone except in self-defense .\n \n He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him, the CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the pain returned, and the mental voice whispered, Unlawful to curse .\n \n He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing a crime. And now that he knew, it didn't seem fair. He decided to tell the whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And as soon as that decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned and the voice, Unlawful to divulge CPA procedure .\n \n \"See what I mean?\" Hendricks asked. \"A century ago, you would have been locked in a prison and taxpayers' money would have supported you until the day you died. With the CPA system, you're returned to society, a useful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you've got a big hand in your dirty little mind that's going to slap it every time you get the wrong kind of thought. It'll keep slapping you until you learn. It might take weeks, months or years, but you'll learn sooner or later to not even think about doing anything wrong.\"\n \n \n\n \n He lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring at the car's plush ceiling.\n\"It's a great system, isn't it, Joe? A true democracy. Even a jerk like you is free to do what he wants, as long as it's legal.\"\n \n \"I think it's a lousy, filthy system.\" Joe's head was still tingling with pain and he felt suffocated. The CPA was everywhere, only now it was also inside his head, telling him he couldn't do this, couldn't do that. All his life it had been telling him he couldn't do things he wanted to do and now ....\n \n Hendricks laughed. \"You'll change your opinion. We live in a clean, wonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people. Except for freaks like yourself, criminals are—\"\n \n \"Let me out!\" Joe grabbed at the door and was on the sidewalk, slamming the door behind him before the car stopped completely.\n \n He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into the stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a prisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated him back.\n \n He wanted to spit his contempt, but the increasingly familiar pain and voice prevented him.\n \n It was unlawful to spit on a sidewalk.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "4a91673a3a10486c98bb515c6c5eb6b8", "response_text": "Joe is at a bar and hands a girl $50 to complete a task for him without telling her what it is yet.

Joe informs the girl that he is assigned a DCT (Dangerous Criminal Tendencies) designation on his CPA ID card. Joe leads the girl to an alley to move his plan into motion. His plan is for her to say that he attempted to rape her because attempted rape is a crime under CPA rules. The girl states that she does not want to go along with that plan because she will lose her rank in the Women’s Self-Defense Association, which is a branch of the CPA. Joe still persists and tries to make her scream. The girl in turn successfully defends herself against him and causes his head to strike the hard concrete floor.

The girl wonders why he doesn't just get a job but hands her his CPA ID card. She sees that he has Dangerous Criminal Tendencies, which she then realizes why. The CPA does not punish criminals and focuses more on preventing crime. Therefore, criminals who get convicted are sent to hospitals where all criminal tendencies are removed from the mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, and many other devices. However, these criminals are also hailed as heroes once they have left the treatment program. The girl agrees to his plan, and they go to the alley. He rips her clothes off and tells her to accuse him of rape. However, she cannot agree to the plan because she is a sergeant of the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA).

The girl suggests finding a job and learns that Joe had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCT), which is visible in his ID card. Joe wants the girl to help him commit a crime which is almost impossible as CPA prevents every crime by various means. Those few who succeed are not punished but given treatment in hospitals after which they become perfect employees wanted by every company.

Nevertheless, the girl refuses as she was taught self-defense and is a sergeant, a rank she doesn't want to lose. When Joe tries anyway, the girl beats him down and police comes soon. They had a hidden microphone nearby and don't believe in the attempted rape story. Conspiracy is not considered a crime and Joe's ID has a larger DCT inscription now - a first class one. This means more cops will watch him as a hobby, as well as neighbors and other people.

Although it is supposed to be wired with CPA burglarproof devices, the owner has not paid for it. There is also a cubbyhole, but the room itself is barely large enough for a bed, chair, and bureau. The place has old underwear and magazines in the bureau; however, there is a watch buried underneath the pile. At the hospital, there is a large window to look out of. There is a large crowd below the hospital steps; many ask for Joe’s autograph, give him gifts, or take photos. The car that rides is robot-chauffeured, and they later pass by a CPA playground. There are girls and boys playing while CPA psychologists stand on the side. Later, the car drops him off at a sidewalk and goes back into the sea of traffic. \n"}, {"worker_id": "105", "uid": "995d1bce82834a66800fc72e066c59c6", "response_text": "The story starts at a table in the bar with a robot bartender.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n \"It is rather unusual,\" Magnan said, \"to assign an officer of your rank to courier duty, but this is an unusual mission.\"\n \n Retief sat relaxed and said nothing. Just before the silence grew awkward, Magnan went on.\n \n \"There are four planets in the group,\" he said. \"Two double planets, all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They're called Jorgensen's Worlds, and in themselves are of no importance whatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soetti have been penetrating.\n \n \"Now—\" Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice—\"we have learned that the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they've met no opposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, they intend to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force.\"\n \n Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief's reaction. Retief drew carefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.\n \n \"This is open aggression, Retief,\" he said, \"in case I haven't made myself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alien species. Obviously, we can't allow it.\"\n \n Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.\n \n \"A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately, Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They're farmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role in their economy—enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The war potential, by conventional standards, is nil.\"\n \n Magnan tapped the folder before him.\n \n \"I have here,\" he said solemnly, \"information which will change that picture completely.\" He leaned back and blinked at Retief.\n \n \n\n \n \"All right, Mr. Councillor,\" Retief said. \"I'll play along; what's in the folder?\"\n \n Magnan spread his fingers, folded one down.\n \n \"First,\" he said. \"The Soetti War Plan—in detail. We were fortunate enough to make contact with a defector from a party of renegade Terrestrials who've been advising the Soetti.\" He folded another finger. \"Next, a battle plan for the Jorgensen's people, worked out by the Theory group.\" He wrestled a third finger down. \"Lastly; an Utter Top Secret schematic for conversion of a standard anti-acceleration field into a potent weapon—a development our systems people have been holding in reserve for just such a situation.\"\n \n \"Is that all?\" Retief said. \"You've still got two fingers sticking up.\"\n \n Magnan looked at the fingers and put them away.\n \n \"This is no occasion for flippancy, Retief. In the wrong hands, this information could be catastrophic. You'll memorize it before you leave this building.\"\n \n \"I'll carry it, sealed,\" Retief said. \"That way nobody can sweat it out of me.\"\n \n Magnan started to shake his head.\n \n \"Well,\" he said. \"If it's trapped for destruction, I suppose—\"\n \n \"I've heard of these Jorgensen's Worlds,\" Retief said. \"I remember an agent, a big blond fellow, very quick on the uptake. A wizard with cards and dice. Never played for money, though.\"\n \n \"Umm,\" Magnan said. \"Don't make the error of personalizing this situation, Retief. Overall policy calls for a defense of these backwater worlds. Otherwise the Corps would allow history to follow its natural course, as always.\"\n \n \"When does this attack happen?\"\n \n \"Less than four weeks.\"\n \n \"That doesn't leave me much time.\"\n \n \"I have your itinerary here. Your accommodations are clear as far as Aldo Cerise. You'll have to rely on your ingenuity to get you the rest of the way.\"\n \n \"That's a pretty rough trip, Mr. Councillor. Suppose I don't make it?\"\n \n Magnan looked sour. \"Someone at a policy-making level has chosen to put all our eggs in one basket, Retief. I hope their confidence in you is not misplaced.\"\n \n \"This antiac conversion; how long does it take?\"\n \n \"A skilled electronics crew can do the job in a matter of minutes. The Jorgensens can handle it very nicely; every other man is a mechanic of some sort.\"\n \n Retief opened the envelope Magnan handed him and looked at the tickets inside.\n \n \"Less than four hours to departure time,\" he said. \"I'd better not start any long books.\"\n \n \"You'd better waste no time getting over to Indoctrination,\" Magnan said.\n \n Retief stood up. \"If I hurry, maybe I can catch the cartoon.\"\n \n \"The allusion escapes me,\" Magnan said coldly. \"And one last word. The Soetti are patrolling the trade lanes into Jorgensen's Worlds; don't get yourself interned.\"\n \n \"I'll tell you what,\" Retief said soberly. \"In a pinch, I'll mention your name.\"\n \n \"You'll be traveling with Class X credentials,\" Magnan snapped. \"There must be nothing to connect you with the Corps.\"\n \n \"They'll never guess,\" Retief said. \"I'll pose as a gentleman.\"\n \n \"You'd better be getting started,\" Magnan said, shuffling papers.\n \n \"You're right,\" Retief said. \"If I work at it, I might manage a snootful by takeoff.\" He went to the door. \"No objection to my checking out a needler, is there?\"\n \n Magnan looked up. \"I suppose not. What do you want with it?\"\n \n \"Just a feeling I've got.\"\n \n \"Please yourself.\"\n \n \"Some day,\" Retief said, \"I may take you up on that.\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n Retief put down the heavy travel-battered suitcase and leaned on the counter, studying the schedules chalked on the board under the legend\n\"ALDO CERISE—INTERPLANETARY.\" A thin clerk in a faded sequined blouse and a plastic snakeskin cummerbund groomed his fingernails, watching Retief from the corner of his eye.\n \n Retief glanced at him.\n \n The clerk nipped off a ragged corner with rabbitlike front teeth and spat it on the floor.\n \n \"Was there something?\" he said.\n \n \"Two twenty-eight, due out today for the Jorgensen group,\" Retief said.\n\"Is it on schedule?\"\n \n The clerk sampled the inside of his right cheek, eyed Retief. \"Filled up. Try again in a couple of weeks.\"\n \n \"What time does it leave?\"\n \n \"I don't think—\"\n \n \"Let's stick to facts,\" Retief said. \"Don't try to think. What time is it due out?\"\n \n The clerk smiled pityingly. \"It's my lunch hour,\" he said. \"I'll be open in an hour.\" He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it.\n \n \"If I have to come around this counter,\" Retief said, \"I'll feed that thumb to you the hard way.\"\n \n The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief's eye, closed his mouth and swallowed.\n \n \"Like it says there,\" he said, jerking a thumb at the board. \"Lifts in an hour. But you won't be on it,\" he added.\n \n Retief looked at him.\n \n \"Some ... ah ... VIP's required accommodation,\" he said. He hooked a finger inside the sequined collar. \"All tourist reservations were canceled. You'll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line ship next—\"\n \n \"Which gate?\" Retief said.\n \n \"For ... ah...?\"\n \n \"For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen's Worlds,\" Retief said.\n \n \"Well,\" the clerk said. \"Gate 19,\" he added quickly. \"But—\"\n \n Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare sign reading To Gates 16-30 .\n \n \"Another smart alec,\" the clerk said behind him.\n \n \n\n \n Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a covered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man with a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled gray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\n \n \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\n \n Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\n \n The guard blinked at it.\n \n \"Whassat?\"\n \n \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter says he's out to lunch.\"\n \n The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back against the handrail.\n \n \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\n \n Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a right into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and went to his knees.\n \n \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked past while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped over the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\n \n A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\n \n \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\n \n \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way along the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven. The door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the floor. It was expensive looking baggage.\n \n Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall, florid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in the open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man clamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n \n \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as he backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\n \n \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear out of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\n \n \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\n \n \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr. Tony's room.\"\n \n \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n \n \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief sat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in the corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an oversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it, glanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n \n \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown out?\"\n \n Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a handle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved the trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the door.\n \n \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the far wall of the corridor and burst.\n \n Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The face of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\n \n \"Mister, you must be—\"\n \n \"If you'll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped the door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\n \n \n\n \n Five minutes passed before the door rattled and burst open.\n \n Retief looked up. A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, a blue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eye stared at Retief.\n \n \"Is this the joker?\" he grated.\n \n The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted,\n\"That's him, sure.\"\n \n \"I'm captain of this vessel,\" the first man said. \"You've got two minutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.\"\n \n \"When you can spare the time from your other duties,\" Retief said,\n\"take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code. That spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged in interplanetary commerce.\"\n \n \"A space lawyer.\" The captain turned. \"Throw him out, boys.\"\n \n Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief.\n \n \"Go on, pitch him out,\" the captain snapped.\n \n Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk.\n \n \"Don't try it,\" he said softly.\n \n One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, and stepped forward, then hesitated.\n \n \"Hey,\" he said. \"This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?\"\n \n \"That's him,\" the thick-necked man called. \"Spilled Mr. Tony's possessions right on the deck.\"\n \n \"Deal me out,\" the bouncer said. \"He can stay put as long as he wants to. I signed on to move cargo. Let's go, Moe.\"\n \n \"You'd better be getting back to the bridge, Captain,\" Retief said.\n\"We're due to lift in twenty minutes.\"\n \n The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. The Captain's voice prevailed.\n \n \"—twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?\"\n \n \"Close the door as you leave,\" Retief said.\n \n The thick-necked man paused at the door. \"We'll see you when you come out.\"\n \n \n\n III\n \n Four waiters passed Retief's table without stopping. A fifth leaned against the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.\n \n At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform and with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male passengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional glances Retief's way.\n \n A panel opened in the wall behind Retief's chair. Bright blue eyes peered out from under a white chef's cap.\n \n \"Givin' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?\"\n \n \"Looks like it, old-timer,\" Retief said. \"Maybe I'd better go join the skipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.\"\n \n \"Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.\"\n \n \"I see your point.\"\n \n \"You set right where you're at, Mister. I'll rustle you up a plate.\"\n \n Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backed up with mushrooms and garlic butter.\n \n \"I'm Chip,\" the chef said. \"I don't like the Cap'n. You can tell him I said so. Don't like his friends, either. Don't like them dern Sweaties, look at a man like he was a worm.\"\n \n \"You've got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip. And you've got the right idea on the Soetti, too,\" Retief said. He poured red wine into a glass. \"Here's to you.\"\n \n \"Dern right,\" Chip said. \"Dunno who ever thought up broiling 'em. Steaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert. You like brandy in yer coffee?\"\n \n \"Chip, you're a genius.\"\n \n \"Like to see a feller eat,\" Chip said. \"I gotta go now. If you need anything, holler.\"\n \n Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days to Jorgensen's Worlds. Then, if Magnan's information was correct, there would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was a temptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. It would be good to know what Jorgensen's Worlds would be up against.\n \n Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and coffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tony and his retainers still sat at the Captain's table.\n \n As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered across the room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took a cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted end in Retief's coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.\n \n The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.\n \n \"You must want to get to Jorgensen's pretty bad,\" the thug said in a grating voice. \"What's your game, hick?\"\n \n Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.\n \n \"I don't think I want my coffee,\" he said. He looked at the thug. \"You drink it.\"\n \n The thug squinted at Retief. \"A wise hick,\" he began.\n \n With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug's face, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thug went down.\n \n Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed.\n \n \"You can take your playmates away now, Tony,\" he said. \"And don't bother to come around yourself. You're not funny enough.\"\n \n Mr. Tony found his voice.\n \n \"Take him, Marbles!\" he growled.\n \n The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out a long-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in.\n \n Retief heard the panel open beside him.\n \n \"Here you go, Mister,\" Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honed french knife lay on the sill.\n \n \"Thanks, Chip,\" Retief said. \"I won't need it for these punks.\"\n \n Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking him under the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistol from his shoulder holster.\n \n \"Aim that at me, and I'll kill you,\" Retief said.\n \n \"Go on, burn him!\" Mr. Tony shouted. Behind him, the captain appeared, white-faced.\n \n \"Put that away, you!\" he yelled. \"What kind of—\"\n \n \"Shut up,\" Mr. Tony said. \"Put it away, Hoany. We'll fix this bum later.\"\n \n \"Not on this vessel, you won't,\" the captain said shakily. \"I got my charter to consider.\"\n \n \"Ram your charter,\" Hoany said harshly. \"You won't be needing it long.\"\n \n \"Button your floppy mouth, damn you!\" Mr. Tony snapped. He looked at the man on the floor. \"Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump the slob.\"\n \n He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters came up. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room.\n \n The panel opened.\n \n \"I usta be about your size, when I was your age,\" Chip said. \"You handled them pansies right. I wouldn't give 'em the time o' day.\"\n \n \"How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip?\" Retief said.\n \n \"Sure, Mister. Anything else?\"\n \n \"I'll think of something,\" Retief said. \"This is shaping up into one of those long days.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"They don't like me bringing yer meals to you in yer cabin,\" Chip said.\n\"But the cap'n knows I'm the best cook in the Merchant Service. They won't mess with me.\"\n \n \"What has Mr. Tony got on the captain, Chip?\" Retief asked.\n \n \"They're in some kind o' crooked business together. You want some more smoked turkey?\"\n \n \"Sure. What have they got against my going to Jorgensen's Worlds?\"\n \n \"Dunno. Hasn't been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I sure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was yer age.\"\n \n \"I'll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen's Worlds like?\"\n \n \"One of 'em's cold as hell and three of 'em's colder. Most o' the Jorgies live on Svea; that's the least froze up. Man don't enjoy eatin' his own cookin' like he does somebody else's.\"\n \n \"That's where I'm lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo's the captain got aboard for Jorgensen's?\"\n \n \"Derned if I know. In and out o' there like a grasshopper, ever few weeks. Don't never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says. Don't know what we even run in there for.\"\n \n \"Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?\"\n \n \"To Alabaster. That's nine days' run in-sector from Jorgensen's. You ain't got another one of them cigars, have you?\"\n \n \"Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.\"\n \n \"Plenty o' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins.\" Chip puffed the cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and brandy.\n \n \"Them Sweaties is what I don't like,\" he said.\n \n Retief looked at him questioningly.\n \n \"You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin' devils. Skinny legs, like a lobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin' head. You can see the pulse beatin' when they get riled.\"\n \n \"I've never had the pleasure,\" Retief said.\n \n \"You prob'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip out. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin'.\"\n \n There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor.\n \n \"I ain't superstitious ner nothin',\" Chip said. \"But I'll be triple-damned if that ain't them boarding us now.\"\n \n Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door, accompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy knock shook the door.\n \n \"They got to look you over,\" Chip whispered. \"Nosy damn Sweaties.\"\n \n \"Unlock it, Chip.\" The chef opened the door.\n \n \"Come in, damn you,\" he said.\n \n A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like feet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set compound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees. Behind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.\n \n \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien rasped.\n \n \"Who's your friend, Captain?\" Retief said.\n \n \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\"\n \n \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien said again.\n \n \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I've seen it. You can take it away now.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Don't horse around,\" the captain said. \"This fellow can get mean.\"\n \n The alien brought two tiny arms out from the concealment of the mantle, clicked toothed pincers under Retief's nose.\n \n \"Quick, soft one.\"\n \n \"Captain, tell your friend to keep its distance. It looks brittle, and I'm tempted to test it.\"\n \n \"Don't start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those snappers.\"\n \n \"Last chance,\" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch from Retief's eyes.\n \n \"Show him your papers, you damned fool,\" the captain said hoarsely. \"I got no control over Skaw.\"\n \n \n\n \n The alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the same instant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alien and drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbous knee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spattering from the burst joint.\n \n \"I told you he was brittle,\" Retief said. \"Next time you invite pirates aboard, don't bother to call.\"\n \n \"Jesus, what did you do! They'll kill us!\" the captain gasped, staring at the figure flopping on the floor.\n \n \"Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat,\" Retief said. \"Tell him to pass the word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels in Terrestrial space.\"\n \n \"Hey,\" Chip said. \"He's quit kicking.\"\n \n The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned close and sniffed.\n \n \"He's dead.\" The captain stared at Retief. \"We're all dead men,\" he said. \"These Soetti got no mercy.\"\n \n \"They won't need it. Tell 'em to sheer off; their fun is over.\"\n \n \"They got no more emotions than a blue crab—\"\n \n \"You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back. We know their secret now.\"\n \n \"What secret? I—\"\n \n \"Don't be no dumber than you got to, Cap'n,\" Chip said. \"Sweaties die easy; that's the secret.\"\n \n \"Maybe you got a point,\" the captain said, looking at Retief. \"All they got's a three-man scout. It could work.\"\n \n He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead alien gingerly into the hall.\n \n \"Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti,\" the captain said, looking back from the door. \"But I'll be back to see you later.\"\n \n \"You don't scare us, Cap'n,\" Chip said. \"Him and Mr. Tony and all his goons. You hit 'em where they live, that time. They're pals o' these Sweaties. Runnin' some kind o' crooked racket.\"\n \n \"You'd better take the captain's advice, Chip. There's no point in your getting involved in my problems.\"\n \n \"They'd of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That's where we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.\"\n \n \"They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.\"\n \n \"They don't scare me none.\" Chip picked up the tray. \"I'll scout around a little and see what's goin' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anything about that Skaw feller they'll have to move fast; they won't try nothin' close to port.\"\n \n \"Don't worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won't do anything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.\"\n \n Chip looked at Retief. \"You ain't no tourist, Mister. I know that much. You didn't come out here for fun, did you?\"\n \n \"That,\" Retief said, \"would be a hard one to answer.\"\n \n \n\n IV\n \n Retief awoke at a tap on his door.\n \n \"It's me, Mister. Chip.\"\n \n \"Come on in.\"\n \n The chef entered the room, locking the door.\n \n \"You shoulda had that door locked.\" He stood by the door, listening, then turned to Retief.\n \n \"You want to get to Jorgensen's perty bad, don't you, Mister?\"\n \n \"That's right, Chip.\"\n \n \"Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. The Sweaties didn't say nothin'. Didn't even act surprised, just took the remains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they call Marbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap'n in his cabin and talked loud at him fer half a hour.

Mr. Tony and one of his “thugs”, Marbles, yell at the Captain for half an hour in his cabin after this incident and force him to change course to not stop at Jorgensen’s Worlds, demonstrating that Mr. Tony has control over the Captain in their relationship.\n"}, {"worker_id": "12", "uid": "99a56fcc57304a0c9fe6563ecde8e7b5", "response_text": "The captain has given up control of the ship to Mr. Tony and has basically become one of his underlings. This is most evident when the captain attempts to throw Retief out of Mr. Tony's room and when he attempts to reroute the ship to Alabaster when Retief beats up Mr. Tony's goons. Chip says that the captain has a crooked business agreement with Mr. Tony, but it becomes clear later in the story that the business agreement is really controlled by the Soetti. The captain says he has no control over Skaw, the Soetti that comes aboard the ship, and becomes very nervous when Retief kills Skaw. "}]}]}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n I\n \n \"The Consul for the Terrestrial States,\" Retief said, \"presents his compliments, et cetera, to the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy, and with reference to the Ministry's invitation to attend a recital of interpretive grimacing, has the honor to express regret that he will be unable—\"\n \n \"You can't turn this invitation down,\" Administrative Assistant Meuhl said flatly. \"I'll make that 'accepts with pleasure'.\"\n \n Retief exhaled a plume of cigar smoke.\n \n \"Miss Meuhl,\" he said, \"in the past couple of weeks I've sat through six light-concerts, four attempts at chamber music, and god knows how many assorted folk-art festivals. I've been tied up every off-duty hour since I got here—\"\n \n \"You can't offend the Groaci,\" Miss Meuhl said sharply. \"Consul Whaffle would never have been so rude.\"\n \n \"Whaffle left here three months ago,\" Retief said, \"leaving me in charge.\"\n \n \"Well,\" Miss Meuhl said, snapping off the dictyper. \"I'm sure I don't know what excuse I can give the Minister.\"\n \n \"Never mind the excuses,\" Retief said. \"Just tell him I won't be there.\" He stood up.\n \n \"Are you leaving the office?\" Miss Meuhl adjusted her glasses. \"I have some important letters here for your signature.\"\n \n \"I don't recall dictating any letters today, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said, pulling on a light cape.\n \n \n\n \n \"I wrote them for you. They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted them.\"\n \n \"Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?\"\n \n \"Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man,\" Miss Meuhl said stiffly.\n\"He had complete confidence in me.\"\n \n \"Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on,\" Retief said, \"I won't be so busy.\"\n \n \"Well!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"May I ask where you'll be if something comes up?\"\n \n \"I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.\"\n \n Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. \"Whatever for?\"\n \n Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. \"You've been here on Groac for four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put the present government in power?\"\n \n \"I'm sure I haven't pried into—\"\n \n \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this way about ten years back?\"\n \n \"Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we avoid with the Groaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding—\"\n \n \"Why?\"\n \n \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders raking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down the fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one occasion.\"\n \n \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\n \n \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed, grilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try never to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\"\n \n \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\"\n \n \"Certainly not on Groac.\"\n \n Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I'll be back before you close the office.\" Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim disapproval as he closed the door.\n \n \n\n \n The pale-featured Groacian vibrated his throat-bladder in a distressed bleat.\n \n \"Not to enter the Archives,\" he said in his faint voice. \"The denial of permission. The deep regret of the Archivist.\"\n \n \"The importance of my task here,\" Retief said, enunciating the glottal dialect with difficulty. \"My interest in local history.\"\n \n \"The impossibility of access to outworlders. To depart quietly.\"\n \n \"The necessity that I enter.\"\n \n \"The specific instructions of the Archivist.\" The Groacian's voice rose to a whisper. \"To insist no longer. To give up this idea!\"\n \n \"OK, Skinny, I know when I'm licked,\" Retief said in Terran. \"To keep your nose clean.\"\n \n Outside, Retief stood for a moment looking across at the deeply carved windowless stucco facades lining the street, then started off in the direction of the Terrestrial Consulate General. The few Groacians on the street eyed him furtively, veered to avoid him as he passed. Flimsy high-wheeled ground cars puffed silently along the resilient pavement. The air was clean and cool.\n \n At the office, Miss Meuhl would be waiting with another list of complaints.\n \n Retief studied the carving over the open doorways along the street. An elaborate one picked out in pinkish paint seemed to indicate the Groacian equivalent of a bar. Retief went in.\n \n A Groacian bartender was dispensing clay pots of alcoholic drink from the bar-pit at the center of the room. He looked at Retief and froze in mid-motion, a metal tube poised over a waiting pot.\n \n \"To enjoy a cooling drink,\" Retief said in Groacian, squatting down at the edge of the pit. \"To sample a true Groacian beverage.\"\n \n \"To not enjoy my poor offerings,\" the Groacian mumbled. \"A pain in the digestive sacs; to express regret.\"\n \n \"To not worry,\" Retief said, irritated. \"To pour it out and let me decide whether I like it.\"\n \n \"To be grappled in by peace-keepers for poisoning of—foreigners.\" The barkeep looked around for support, found none. The Groaci customers, eyes elsewhere, were drifting away.\n \n \"To get the lead out,\" Retief said, placing a thick gold-piece in the dish provided. \"To shake a tentacle.\"\n \n \"The procuring of a cage,\" a thin voice called from the sidelines. \"The displaying of a freak.\"\n \n \n\n \n Retief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gesture of contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent the creature was drunk.\n \n \"To choke in your upper sac,\" the bartender hissed, extending his eyes toward the drunk. \"To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.\"\n \n \"To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness,\" the drunk whispered. \"To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece.\" He wavered toward Retief. \"To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.\"\n \n \"Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you?\" Retief asked, interestedly.\n \n \"To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder,\" the drunk said. The barkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk, took his arms and helped him to the door.\n \n \"To get a cage!\" the drunk shrilled. \"To keep the animals in their own stinking place.\"\n \n \"I've changed my mind,\" Retief said to the bartender. \"To be grateful as hell, but to have to hurry off now.\" He followed the drunk out the door. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief looked at the weaving alien.\n \n \"To begone, freak,\" the Groacian whispered.\n \n \"To be pals,\" Retief said. \"To be kind to dumb animals.\"\n \n \"To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.\"\n \n \"To not be angry, fragrant native,\" Retief said. \"To permit me to chum with you.\"\n \n \"To flee before I take a cane to you!\"\n \n \"To have a drink together—\"\n \n \"To not endure such insolence!\" The Groacian advanced toward Retief. Retief backed away.\n \n \"To hold hands,\" Retief said. \"To be palsy-walsy—\"\n \n The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him, head down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrow crossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local, who followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrow alley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the following Groacian.\n \n Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian fell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose; Retief put a foot against his chest and pushed.\n \n \"To not be going anywhere for a few minutes,\" Retief said. \"To stay right here and have a nice long talk.\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n \"There you are!\" Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. \"There are two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.\"\n \n \"Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast.\" Retief pulled off his cape. \"This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the Foreign Ministry.\"\n \n \"What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind telling you.\"\n \n \"I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.\"\n \n Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments indicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered a courteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.\n \n \"I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Consul,\" the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. \"May I present Shluh, of the Internal Police?\"\n \n \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" Retief said. They resumed their seats. Miss Meuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.\n \n \"Oh, it's such a pleasure—\" she began.\n \n \"Never mind that,\" Retief said. \"These gentlemen didn't come here to sip tea today.\"\n \n \"So true,\" Fith said. \"Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report, Mr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it.\" He nodded to the police chief.\n \n \"One hour ago,\" The Groacian said, \"a Groacian national was brought to hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of this individual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a foreigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department indicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of the Terrestrial Consul.\"\n \n Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.\n \n \"Have you ever heard,\" Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, \"of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific , which dropped from sight in this sector nine years ago?\"\n \n \"Really!\" Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. \"I wash my hands—\"\n \n \"Just keep that recorder going,\" Retief snapped.\n \n \"I'll not be a party—\"\n \n \"You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said quietly. \"I'm telling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.\"\n \n Miss Meuhl sat down.\n \n Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. \"You reopen an old wound, Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial hands—\"\n \n \"Hogwash,\" Retief said. \"That tune went over with my predecessors, but it hits a sour note with me.\"\n \n \"All our efforts,\" Miss Meuhl said, \"to live down that terrible episode! And you—\"\n \n \"Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac and sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny answers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left. Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe—at the most. If they were innocent.\"\n \n \"IF!\" Miss Meuhl burst out.\n \n \"If, indeed!\" Fith said, his weak voice trembling. \"I must protest your—\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don't think your story will be good enough.\"\n \n \"It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten—\"\n \n \"Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.\"\n \n \"Then you admit—\"\n \n \"It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to it.\"\n \n Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.\n \n \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for your diplomatic immunity, I should do more—\"\n \n \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force paid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial diplomatic mission.\"\n \n \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.\n\"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It has outdone itself—\"\n \n \"—to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief said. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you've visaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the diplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or your satellite—\"\n \n \"Enough!\" Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of this matter—\"\n \n \"You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to do the talking,\" Retief said.\n \n \"You can't!\" Miss Meuhl gasped.\n \n Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The Groaci sat down.\n \n \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years back—about nine, I think—there was a little parade held here. Some curious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged, they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the streets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.\n \n \"Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to communicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.\n \n \"Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the parade was over?\"\n \n \n\n \n Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh retracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her mouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n \n \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their throats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure out for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them yell....\"\n \n \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at once.\"\n \n \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple narco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the parade.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there was no killing.\"\n \n \"They're alive?\"\n \n \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\n \n Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\n \n \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\n \n \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what foods—\"\n \n \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\n \n \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\n \n \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want more information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship? What happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the big parade?\"\n \n \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\"\n \n \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\n \n \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ... Terrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were strange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\"\n \n \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\"\n \n \"Guns? No, no guns—\"\n \n \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them; helped them to death.\"\n \n \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\n \n \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking for them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a brisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close call, eh?\"\n \n \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the strange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we felt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships came, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our guilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our friendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made a blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make amends....\"\n \n \"Where is the ship?\"\n \n \"The ship?\"\n \n \"What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget. Where is it?\"\n \n The two Groacians exchanged looks.\n \n \"We wish to show our contrition,\" Fith said. \"We will show you the ship.\"\n \n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said. \"If I don't come back in a reasonable length of time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed.\" He stood, looked at the Groaci.\n \n \"Let's go,\" he said.\n \n \n\n \n Retief stooped under the heavy timbers shoring the entry to the cavern. He peered into the gloom at the curving flank of the space-burned hull.\n \n \"Any lights in here?\" he asked.\n \n A Groacian threw a switch. A weak bluish glow sprang up.\n \n Retief walked along the raised wooden catwalk, studying the ship. Empty emplacements gaped below lensless scanner eyes. Littered decking was visible within the half-open entry port. Near the bow the words 'IVS Terrific B7 New Terra' were lettered in bright chrome duralloy.\n \n \"How did you get it in here?\" Retief asked.\n \n \"It was hauled here from the landing point, some nine miles distant,\" Fith said, his voice thinner than ever. \"This is a natural crevasse. The vessel was lowered into it and roofed over.\"\n \n \"How did you shield it so the detectors didn't pick it up?\"\n \n \"All here is high-grade iron ore,\" Fith said, waving a member. \"Great veins of almost pure metal.\"\n \n Retief grunted. \"Let's go inside.\"\n \n Shluh came forward with a hand-lamp. The party entered the ship.\n \n Retief clambered up a narrow companionway, glanced around the interior of the control compartment. Dust was thick on the deck, the stanchions where acceleration couches had been mounted, the empty instrument panels, the litter of sheared bolts, scraps of wire and paper. A thin frosting of rust dulled the exposed metal where cutting torches had sliced away heavy shielding. There was a faint odor of stale bedding.\n \n \"The cargo compartment—\" Shluh began.\n \n \"I've seen enough,\" Retief said.\n \n Silently, the Groacians led the way back out through the tunnel and into the late afternoon sunshine. As they climbed the slope to the steam car, Fith came to Retief's side.\n \n \"Indeed, I hope that this will be the end of this unfortunate affair,\" he said. \"Now that all has been fully and honestly shown—\"\n \n \"You can skip all that,\" Retief said. \"You're nine years late. The crew was still alive when the task force called, I imagine. You killed them—or let them die—rather than take the chance of admitting what you'd done.\"\n \n \"We were at fault,\" Fith said abjectly. \"Now we wish only friendship.\"\n \n \"The Terrific was a heavy cruiser, about twenty thousand tons.\" Retief looked grimly at the slender Foreign Office official. \"Where is she, Fith? I won't settle for a hundred-ton lifeboat.\"\n \n \n\n \n Fith erected his eye stalks so violently that one eye-shield fell off.\n \n \"I know nothing of ... of....\" He stopped. His throat vibrated rapidly as he struggled for calm.\n \n \"My government can entertain no further accusations, Mr. Consul,\" he said at last. \"I have been completely candid with you, I have overlooked your probing into matters not properly within your sphere of responsibility. My patience is at an end.\"\n \n \"Where is that ship?\" Retief rapped out. \"You never learn, do you? You're still convinced you can hide the whole thing and forget it. I'm telling you you can't.\"\n \n \"We return to the city now,\" Fith said. \"I can do no more.\"\n \n \"You can and you will, Fith,\" Retief said. \"I intend to get to the truth of this matter.\"\n \n Fith spoke to Shluh in rapid Groacian. The police chief gestured to his four armed constables. They moved to ring Retief in.\n \n Retief eyed Fith. \"Don't try it,\" he said. \"You'll just get yourself in deeper.\"\n \n Fith clacked his mandibles angrily, eye stalks canted aggressively toward the Terrestrial.\n \n \"Out of deference to your diplomatic status, Terrestrial, I shall ignore your insulting remarks,\" Fith said in his reedy voice. \"Let us now return to the city.\"\n \n Retief looked at the four policemen. \"I see your point,\" he said.\n \n Fith followed him into the car, sat rigidly at the far end of the seat.\n \n \"I advise you to remain very close to your consulate,\" Fith said. \"I advise you to dismiss these fancies from your mind, and to enjoy the cultural aspects of life at Groac. Especially, I should not venture out of the city, or appear overly curious about matters of concern only to the Groacian government.\"\n \n In the front seat, Shluh looked straight ahead. The loosely-sprung vehicle bobbed and swayed along the narrow highway. Retief listened to the rhythmic puffing of the motor and said nothing.\n \n \n\n III\n \n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said, \"I want you to listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. I have to move rapidly now, to catch the Groaci off guard.\"\n \n \"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about,\" Miss Meuhl snapped, her eyes sharp behind the heavy lenses.\n \n \"If you'll listen, you may find out,\" Retief said. \"I have no time to waste, Miss Meuhl. They won't be expecting an immediate move—I hope—and that may give me the latitude I need.\"\n \n \"You're still determined to make an issue of that incident!\" Miss Meuhl snorted. \"I really can hardly blame the Groaci. They are not a sophisticated race; they had never before met aliens.\"\n \n \"You're ready to forgive a great deal, Miss Meuhl. But it's not what happened nine years ago I'm concerned with. It's what's happening now. I've told you that it was only a lifeboat the Groaci have hidden out. Don't you understand the implication? That vessel couldn't have come far. The cruiser itself must be somewhere near by. I want to know where!\"\n \n \"The Groaci don't know. They're a very cultured, gentle people. You can do irreparable harm to the reputation of Terrestrials if you insist—\"\n \n \"That's my decision,\" Retief said. \"I have a job to do and we're wasting time.\" He crossed the room to his desk, opened a drawer and took out a slim-barreled needler.\n \n \"This office is being watched. Not very efficiently, if I know the Groaci. I think I can get past them all right.\"\n \n \"Where are you going with ... that?\" Miss Meuhl stared at the needler.\n\"What in the world—\"\n \n \"The Groaci won't waste any time destroying every piece of paper in their files relating to this thing. I have to get what I need before it's too late. If I wait for an official Inquiry Commission, they'll find nothing but blank smiles.\"\n \n \"You're out of your mind!\" Miss Meuhl stood up, quivering with indignation. \"You're like a ... a....\"\n \n \"You and I are in a tight spot, Miss Meuhl. The logical next move for the Groaci is to dispose of both of us. We're the only ones who know what happened. Fith almost did the job this afternoon, but I bluffed him out—for the moment.\"\n \n Miss Meuhl emitted a shrill laugh. \"Your fantasies are getting the better of you,\" she gasped. \"In danger, indeed! Disposing of me! I've never heard anything so ridiculous.\"\n \n \"Stay in this office. Close and safe-lock the door. You've got food and water in the dispenser. I suggest you stock up, before they shut the supply down. Don't let anyone in, on any pretext whatever. I'll keep in touch with you via hand-phone.\"\n \n \"What are you planning to do?\"\n \n \"If I don't make it back here, transmit the sealed record of this afternoon's conversation, along with the information I've given you. Beam it through on a mayday priority. Then tell the Groaci what you've done and sit tight. I think you'll be all right. It won't be easy to blast in here and anyway, they won't make things worse by killing you. A force can be here in a week.\"\n \n \"I'll do nothing of the sort! The Groaci are very fond of me! You ... Johnny-come-lately! Roughneck! Setting out to destroy—\"\n \n \"Blame it on me if it will make you feel any better,\" Retief said, \"but don't be fool enough to trust them.\" He pulled on a cape, opened the door.\n \n \"I'll be back in a couple of hours,\" he said. Miss Meuhl stared after him silently as he closed the door.\n \n \n\n \n It was an hour before dawn when Retief keyed the combination to the safe-lock and stepped into the darkened consular office. He looked tired.\n \n Miss Meuhl, dozing in a chair, awoke with a start. She looked at Retief, rose and snapped on a light, turned to stare.\n \n \"What in the world—Where have you been? What's happened to your clothing?\"\n \n \"I got a little dirty. Don't worry about it.\" Retief went to his desk, opened a drawer and replaced the needler.\n \n \"Where have you been?\" Miss Meuhl demanded. \"I stayed here—\"\n \n \"I'm glad you did,\" Retief said. \"I hope you piled up a supply of food and water from the dispenser, too. We'll be holed up here for a week, at least.\" He jotted figures on a pad. \"Warm up the official sender. I have a long transmission for Regional Headquarters.\"\n \n \"Are you going to tell me where you've been?\"\n \n \"I have a message to get off first, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said sharply.\n\"I've been to the Foreign Ministry,\" he added. \"I'll tell you all about it later.\"\n \n \"At this hour? There's no one there....\"\n \n \"Exactly.\"\n \n Miss Meuhl gasped. \"You mean you broke in? You burgled the Foreign Office?\"\n \n \"That's right,\" Retief said calmly. \"Now—\"\n \n \"This is absolutely the end!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"Thank heaven I've already—\"\n \n \"Get that sender going, woman!\" Retief snapped. \"This is important.\"\n \n \"I've already done so, Mr. Retief!\" Miss Meuhl said harshly. \"I've been waiting for you to come back here....\" She turned to the communicator, flipped levers. The screen snapped aglow, and a wavering long-distance image appeared.\n \n \"He's here now,\" Miss Meuhl said to the screen. She looked at Retief triumphantly.\n \n \"That's good,\" Retief said. \"I don't think the Groaci can knock us off the air, but—\"\n \n \"I have done my duty, Mr. Retief,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"I made a full report to Regional Headquarters last night, as soon as you left this office. Any doubts I may have had as to the rightness of that decision have been completely dispelled by what you've just told me.\"\n \n Retief looked at her levelly. \"You've been a busy girl, Miss Meuhl. Did you mention the six Terrestrials who were killed here?\"\n \n \"That had no bearing on the matter of your wild behavior! I must say, in all my years in the Corps, I've never encountered a personality less suited to diplomatic work.\"\n \n \n\n \n The screen crackled, the ten-second transmission lag having elapsed.\n\"Mr. Retief,\" the face on the screen said, \"I am Counsellor Pardy, DSO-1, Deputy Under-secretary for the region. I have received a report on your conduct which makes it mandatory for me to relieve you administratively, vice Miss Yolanda Meuhl, DAO-9. Pending the findings of a Board of Inquiry, you will—\"\n \n Retief reached out and snapped off the communicator. The triumphant look faded from Miss Meuhl's face.\n \n \"Why, what is the meaning—\"\n \n \"If I'd listened any longer, I might have heard something I couldn't ignore. I can't afford that, at this moment. Listen, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief went on earnestly, \"I've found the missing cruiser.\"\n \n \"You heard him relieve you!\"\n \n \"I heard him say he was going to, Miss Meuhl.

Much to Miss Meuhl's dismay, Retief shirks his cultural duties and makes his way to the Foreign Office Archives, whereupon he is promptly barred from entering by a pale-featured Archivist speaking in the throat-bladder vibrations of the native Groacians. Because of the Archivist's insistence that \"outworlders\" cannot access the archives, Retief begins walking back to the Consulate and stops at a bar for a drink.

Miss Meuhl continually interjects, expresses horror at Retief's claims, and apologizes to the Groacians on behalf of the Terrestrial Consulate. Despite the persistent denials of the Groacians, Retief continues his accusations, suggesting the coup d'etat was an effort to silence government officials with knowledge of the truth of what happened to the cruiser and its crew.

The ship was a Terrestrial cruiser that went missing nine years ago in the Groaci sector of the galaxy. Consul Retief is trying to track down the ship and discover what happened to the passengers. He suspects that the ship crashed on the Groaci’s planet and that the Groaci killed the people on it. He is on a mission to answer these questions. He first asks Miss Meuhl what she knows about it. She refuses to discuss it, siding with the Groacis and defending them as a very sensitive race and stating she is ashamed of how they were treated when the investigation was conducted. Retief tries to enter the Archives and local museum to search for information but is denied entry. \nBut he stumbles on a clue in a bar when a drunken Groaci points at him and says they need to find a proper cage for him; Retief follows the drunk out of the bar and learns that the Groaci captured the passengers and caged, paraded, and exhibited them. Fith and Shluh admit that these Terrestrials died but that the Groaci tried to keep them alive but didn’t know what foods they ate. They fell ill one by one and died. The Groaci claim that they didn’t realize the significance of the humans until the warships came to investigate, and then the Groaci were afraid to say anything. Afterward, they got rid of their government, replaced it with a new one, hid the ship, and invited diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. Fith and Shluh also reveal that the ship didn’t crash but landed intact and claim that the ship is hidden in a cavern now and offer to show it to Retief. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific  but is, instead, a lifeboat. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry during the night and finds answers to his questions, but before he can transmit the information that he has learned, Miss Meuhl notifies the Regional Headquarters of his actions, having him removed as consul, and allows the Groaci into the consulate to take Retief into custody.\nThus, the ISV Terrific is the basis for interplanetary hostilities, the opening of a diplomatic channel between the Groacians and the Terrestrials, the overthrow of the Groaci government, and an unsolved mystery that could reopen hostilities when the truth of the matter is revealed.\n"}]}, {"question_text": "Who is Miss Meuhl and what is her role in the story?", "question_number": 5, "responses": [{"worker_id": "8", "uid": "859d15ea77e145aab1af8b304e005f78", "response_text": "Miss Yolanda Meuhl is the Administrative Assistant of The Consul for the Terrestrial States Retief, the replacement for Consul Whaffle who left the post three months prior.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n His name was Herrell McCray and he was scared.\n \n As best he could tell, he was in a sort of room no bigger than a prison cell. Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business in it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump from Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray was ship's navigator, plotting course corrections—not that there were any, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings were made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth angles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon stars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the locking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had done it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel and Saiph ... it happened.\n \n The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a collection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes and a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something that rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered hollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled dangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right through his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched it.\n \n McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n \n Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not quite utter silence.\n \n Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something like a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as still as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n \n Probably it was only an illusion.\n \n But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n \n It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get from a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on Starship Jodrell Bank to this damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to hurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in exasperation: \"If I could only see !\"\n \n He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like baker's dough, not at all resilient.\n \n A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He was looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.\n \n \n\n \n It was, he saw in a moment, not armor but a spacesuit. But what was the light? And what were these other things in the room?\n \n Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like having tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was looking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could see made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could construct a logical explanation for that with no trouble—maybe a subspace meteorite striking the Jodrell Bank , an explosion, himself knocked out, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more holes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.\n \n How to explain a set of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the chemistry set—or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric that, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing suit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of the objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair—why, he'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old enough to go to school. But what were they doing here?\n \n Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were strange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were not papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made of some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or processed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light. But they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"—the color of aged driftwood or unbleached cloth.\n \n Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth wall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings; from them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be ventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse than what he already had.\n \n McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a little light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his courage flowed back when he could see again.\n \n He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago—subjectively it seemed to be minutes—he had been aboard the Jodrell Bank with nothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting one of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being shaken up and—he admitted it—scared damn near witless, he did not seem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much what had happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?\n \n He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been an accident to the Jodrell Bank .\n \n He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a cooling brain.\n \n McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow refreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head he remembered what a spacesuit was good for.\n \n It held a radio.\n \n He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest of the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he said, \"calling the Jodrell Bank .\"\n \n No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling Jodrell Bank .\n \n \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\"\n \n But there was no answer.\n \n Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio, something more than a million times faster than light, with a range measured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer, he was a good long way from anywhere.\n \n Of course, the thing might not be operating.\n \n He reached for the microphone again—\n \n He cried aloud.\n \n The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than before.\n \n For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped his eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in the pinkish glimmer; but the hand—his own hand, cupped to hold the microphone—he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting moment of study, his chest.\n \n McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.\n \n \n\n II\n \n Someone else could.\n \n Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination of a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new antibiotic—and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked, sailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that may contain food.\n \n Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\") Hatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but it did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in any way look like a human being, but they had features in common.\n \n If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance, they might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an adventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences of his culture. Both enjoyed games—McCray baseball, poker and three-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human description. Both held positions of some importance—considering their ages—in the affairs of their respective worlds.\n \n Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot, hard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were not organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which obeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes curl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well a yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested in the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater distances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of Inverse Squares.\n \n Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\" which had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little excited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on various errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest limbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a state of violent commotion.\n \n The probe team had had a shock.\n \n \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the others mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the specimen from Earth.\n \n After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.\n\"Incredible—but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report. Watch him,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to watch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of them could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of a creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as Herrell McCray.\n \n \n\n \n Hatcher hurried through the halls of the great buried structure in which he worked, toward the place where the supervising council of all probes would be in permanent session. They admitted him at once.\n \n Hatcher identified himself and gave a quick, concise report:\n \n \"The subject recovered consciousness a short time ago and began to inspect his enclosure. His method of doing so was to put his own members in physical contact with the various objects in the enclosure. After observing him do this for a time we concluded he might be unable to see and so we illuminated his field of vision for him.\n \n \"This appeared to work well for a time. He seemed relatively undisturbed. However, he then reverted to physical-contact, manipulating certain appurtenances of an artificial skin we had provided for him.\n \n \"He then began to vibrate the atmosphere by means of resonating organs in his breathing passage.\n \n \"Simultaneously, the object he was holding, attached to the artificial skin, was discovered to be generating paranormal forces.\"\n \n The supervising council rocked with excitement. \"You're sure?\" demanded one of the councilmen.\n \n \"Yes, sir. The staff is preparing a technical description of the forces now, but I can say that they are electromagnetic vibrations modulating a carrier wave of very high speed, and in turn modulated by the vibrations of the atmosphere caused by the subject's own breathing.\"\n \n \"Fantastic,\" breathed the councillor, in a tone of dawning hope. \"How about communicating with him, Hatcher? Any progress?\"\n \n \"Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; but we thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.\"\n \n The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting. It was not really a waste of time for him; with the organs he had left in the probe-team room, he was in fairly close touch with what was going on—knew that McCray was once again fumbling among the objects in the dark, knew that the team-members had tried illuminating the room for him briefly and again produced the rising panic.\n \n Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted to get back.\n \n \"Stop fidgeting,\" commanded the council leader abruptly. \"Hatcher, you are to establish communication at once.\"\n \n \"But, sir....\" Hatcher swung closer, his thick skin quivering slightly; he would have gestured if he had brought members with him to gesture with. \"We've done everything we dare. We've made the place homey for him—\" actually, what he said was more like, we've warmed the biophysical nuances of his enclosure —\"and tried to guess his needs; and we're frightening him half to death. We can't go faster. This creature is in no way similar to us, you know. He relies on paranormal forces—heat, light, kinetic energy—for his life. His chemistry is not ours, his processes of thought are not ours, his entire organism is closer to the inanimate rocks of a sea-bottom than to ourselves.\"\n \n \"Understood, Hatcher. In your first report you stated these creatures were intelligent.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. But not in our way.\"\n \n \"But in a way, and you must learn that way. I know.\" One lobster-claw shaped member drifted close to the councillor's body and raised itself in an admonitory gesture. \"You want time. But we don't have time, Hatcher. Yours is not the only probe team working. The Central Masses team has just turned in a most alarming report.\"\n \n \"Have they secured a subject?\" Hatcher demanded jealously.\n \n The councillor paused. \"Worse than that, Hatcher. I am afraid their subjects have secured one of them. One of them is missing.\"\n \n There was a moment's silence. Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. The council room was like a tableau in a museum until the councillor spoke again, each council member poised over his locus-point, his members drifting about him.\n \n Finally the councillor said, \"I speak for all of us, I think. If the Old Ones have seized one of our probers our time margin is considerably narrowed. Indeed, we may not have any time at all. You must do everything you can to establish communication with your subject.\"\n \n \"But the danger to the specimen—\" Hatcher protested automatically.\n \n \"—is no greater,\" said the councillor, \"than the danger to every one of us if we do not find allies now .\"\n \n \n\n \n Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.\n \n It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had a reputation for demanding results at any cost—even at the cost of destroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.\n \n Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannot be said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathy that caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward communication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting physical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But Hatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough getting him here.\n \n Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of his team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he took time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not entirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his body opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which Hatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the eating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture of kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for another day.\n \n He returned quickly to the room.\n \n His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers reported—nothing new—and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the council. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his staff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but decided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other hand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was not lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat of the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical beings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in ages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and hiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it—with its population—as a decoy, had they arrived at all.\n \n Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near the spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they had begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of fleeing again.\n \n But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their existence to their enemies—\n \n \"Hatcher!\"\n \n The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his second in command, very excited. \"What is it?\" Hatcher demanded.\n \n \"Wait....\"\n \n Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something was about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to him for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted themselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into his own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had just taken.... \"Now!\" cried the assistant. \"Look!\"\n \n At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an image was forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a cathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to show.\n \n Hatcher was startled. \"Another one! And—is it a different species? Or merely a different sex?\"\n \n \"Study the probe for yourself,\" the assistant invited.\n \n Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.\n\"No matter,\" he said at last. \"Bring the other one in.\"\n \n And then, in a completely different mood, \"We may need him badly. We may be in the process of killing our first one now.\"\n \n \"Killing him, Hatcher?\"\n \n Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like puppies dislodged from suck. \"Council's orders,\" he said. \"We've got to go into Stage Two of the project at once.\"\n \n \n\n III\n \n Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun, he had an inspiration.\n \n The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been and groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to have. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed it.\n \n Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything—even himself.\n \n \"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that pinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now that he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects on some strange property of the light.\n \n At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.\n \n He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.\n \n For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm and almost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was gone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had hardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was, perhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very faint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.\n \n McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no change.\n \n And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.\n \n He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell one. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger now. He stood there, perplexed.\n \n A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply, amazement in its tone, \"McCray, is that you? Where the devil are you calling from?\"\n \n He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he cried. \"I'm in a room of some sort, apparently on a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know—\"\n \n \"McCray!\" cried the tiny voice in his ear. \"Where are you? This is Jodrell Bank calling. Answer, please!\"\n \n \"I am answering, damn it,\" he roared. \"What took you so long?\"\n \n \"Herrell McCray,\" droned the tiny voice in his ear, \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is Jodrell Bank responding to your message, acknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....\"\n \n It kept on, and on.\n \n McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they didn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or—no. That was not it; they had heard him, because they were responding. But it seemed to take them so long....\n \n Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his mind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was it he called them? Two hours ago? Three?\n \n Did that mean—did it possibly mean—that there was a lag of an hour or two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his suit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took hours to get a message to the ship and back?\n \n And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?\n \n \n\n \n Herrell McCray was a navigator, which is to say, a man who has learned to trust the evidence of mathematics and instrument readings beyond the guesses of his \"common sense.\" When Jodrell Bank , hurtling faster than light in its voyage between stars, made its regular position check, common sense was a liar. Light bore false witness. The line of sight was trustworthy directly forward and directly after—sometimes not even then—and it took computers, sensing their data through instruments, to comprehend a star bearing and convert three fixes into a position.\n \n If the evidence of his radio contradicted common sense, common sense was wrong. Perhaps it was impossible to believe what the radio's message implied; but it was not necessary to \"believe,\" only to act.\n \n McCray thumbed down the transmitter button and gave a concise report of his situation and his guesses. \"I don't know how I got here. I don't know how long I've been gone, since I was unconscious for a time. However, if the transmission lag is a reliable indication—\" he swallowed and went on—\"I'd estimate I am something more than five hundred light-years away from you at this moment. That's all I have to say, except for one more word: Help.\"\n \n He grinned sourly and released the button. The message was on its way, and it would be hours before he could have a reply. Therefore he had to consider what to do next.\n \n He mopped his brow. With the droning, repetitious call from the ship finally quiet, the room was quiet again. And warm.\n \n Very warm, he thought tardily; and more than that. The halogen stench was strong in his nostrils again.\n \n Hurriedly McCray scrambled into the suit. By the time he was sealed down he was coughing from the bottom of his lungs, deep, tearing rasps that pained him, uncontrollable. Chlorine or fluorine, one of them was in the air he had been breathing. He could not guess where it had come from; but it was ripping his lungs out.\n \n He flushed the interior of the suit out with a reckless disregard for the wastage of his air reserve, holding his breath as much as he could, daring only shallow gasps that made him retch and gag. After a long time he could breathe, though his eyes were spilling tears.\n \n He could see the fumes in the room now. The heat was building up.\n \n Automatically—now that he had put it on and so started its servo-circuits operating—the suit was cooling him. This was a deep-space suit, regulation garb when going outside the pressure hull of an FTL ship. It was good up to at least five hundred degrees in thin air, perhaps three or four hundred in dense. In thin air or in space it was the elastic joints and couplings that depolymerized when the heat grew too great; in dense air, with conduction pouring energy in faster than the cooling coils could suck it out and hurl it away, it was the refrigerating equipment that broke down.\n \n McCray had no way of knowing just how hot it was going to get. Nor, for that matter, had the suit been designed to operate in a corrosive medium.\n \n All in all it was time for him to do something.\n \n \n\n \n Among the debris on the floor, he remembered, was a five-foot space-ax, tungsten-steel blade and springy aluminum shaft.\n \n McCray caught it up and headed for the door. It felt good in his gauntlets, a rewarding weight; any weapon straightens the back of the man who holds it, and McCray was grateful for this one. With something concrete to do he could postpone questioning. Never mind why he had been brought here; never mind how. Never mind what he would, or could, do next; all those questions could recede into the background of his mind while he swung the ax and battered his way out of this poisoned oven.\n \n \n\n Crash-clang! The double jolt ran up the shaft of the ax, through his gauntlets and into his arm; but he was making progress, he could see the plastic—or whatever it was—of the door. It was chipping out. Not easily, very reluctantly; but flaking out in chips that left a white powdery residue.\n \n At this rate, he thought grimly, he would be an hour getting through it. Did he have an hour?\n \n But it did not take an hour. One blow was luckier than the rest; it must have snapped the lock mechanism. The door shook and slid ajar. McCray got the thin of the blade into the crack and pried it wide.\n \n He was in another room, maybe a hall, large and bare.\n \n McCray put the broad of his back against the broken door and pressed it as nearly closed as he could; it might not keep the gas and heat out, but it would retard them.\n \n The room was again unlighted—at least to McCray's eyes. There was not even that pink pseudo-light that had baffled him; here was nothing but the beam of his suit lamp. What it showed was cryptic. There were evidences of use: shelves, boxy contraptions that might have been cupboards, crude level surfaces attached to the walls that might have been workbenches. Yet they were queerly contrived, for it was not possible to guess from them much about the creatures who used them. Some were near the floor, some at waist height, some even suspended from the ceiling itself. A man would need a ladder to work at these benches and McCray, staring, thought briefly of many-armed blind giants or shapeless huge intelligent amoebae, and felt the skin prickle at the back of his neck.\n \n He tapped half-heartedly at one of the closed cupboards, and was not surprised when it proved as refractory as the door. Undoubtedly he could batter it open, but it was not likely that much would be left of its contents when he was through; and there was the question of time.\n \n But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches. Metallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a stiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar. They were, he thought, very much like the parts of a bullet-gun.\n \n In fact, they were. He could recognize barrel, chamber, trigger, even a couple of cartridges, neatly opened and the grains of powder stacked beside them. It was an older, clumsier model than the kind he had seen in survival locker, on the Jodrell Bank —and abruptly wished he were carrying now—but it was a pistol. Another trophy, like the strange assortment in the other room? He could not guess. But the others had been more familiar; they all have come from his own ship. He was prepared to swear that nothing like this antique had been aboard.\n \n The drone began again in his ear, as it had at five-minute intervals all along:\n \n \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is Jodrell Bank calling Herrell McCray....\"\n \n And louder, blaring, then fading to normal volume as the AVC circuits toned the signal down, another voice. A woman's voice, crying out in panic and fear: \" Jodrell Bank! Where are you? Help!\"\n \n \n\n IV\n \n Hatcher's second in command said: \"He has got through the first survival test. In fact, he broke his way out! What next?\"\n \n \"Wait!\" Hatcher ordered sharply. He was watching the new specimen and a troublesome thought had occurred to him. The new one was female and seemed to be in pain; but it was not the pain that disturbed Hatcher, it was something far more immediate to his interests.\n \n \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that they are in contact.\"\n \n His assistant vibrated startlement.\n \n \"I know,\" Hatcher said, \"but watch. Do you see? He is going straight toward her.\"\n \n Hatcher, who was not human, did not possess truly human emotions; but he did feel amazement when he was amazed, and fear when there was cause to be afraid. These specimens, obtained with so much difficulty, needed so badly, were his responsibility. He knew the issues involved much better than any of his helpers. They could only be surprised at the queer antics of the aliens with attached limbs and strange powers. Hatcher knew that this was not a freak show, but a matter of life and death. He said, musing:\n \n \"This new one, I cannot communicate with her, but I get—almost—a whisper, now and then. The first one, the male, nothing. But this female is perhaps not quite mute.\"\n \n \"Then shall we abandon him and work with her, forgetting the first one?\"\n \n Hatcher hesitated. \"No,\" he said at last. \"The male is responding well. Remember that when last this experiment was done every subject died; he is alive at least. But I am wondering. We can't quite communicate with the female—\"\n \n \"But?\"\n \n \"But I'm not sure that others can't.\"\n \n \n\n \n The woman's voice was at such close range that McCray's suit radio made a useful RDF set. He located her direction easily enough, shielding the tiny built-in antenna with the tungsten-steel blade of the ax, while she begged him to hurry. Her voice was heavily accented, with some words in a language he did not recognize. She seemed to be in shock.\n \n McCray was hardly surprised at that; he had been close enough to shock himself. He tried to reassure her as he searched for a way out of the hall, but in the middle of a word her voice stopped.\n \n He hesitated, hefting the ax, glancing back at the way he had come. There had to be a way out, even if it meant chopping through a wall.\n \n When he turned around again there was a door. It was oddly shaped and unlike the door he had hewn through, but clearly a door all the same, and it was open.\n \n McCray regarded it grimly. He went back in his memory with meticulous care. Had he not looked at, this very spot a matter of moments before? He had. And had there been an open door then? There had not. There hadn't been even a shadowy outline of the three-sided, uneven opening that stood there now.\n \n Still, it led in the proper direction. McCray added one more inexplicable fact to his file and walked through. He was in another hall—or tunnel—rising quite steeply to the right. By his reckoning it was the proper direction. He labored up it, sweating under the weight of the suit, and found another open door, this one round, and behind it—\n \n Yes, there was the woman whose voice he had heard.\n \n It was a woman, all right. The voice had been so strained that he hadn't been positive. Even now, short black hair might not have proved it, and she was lying face down but the waist and hips were a woman's, even though she wore a bulky, quilted suit of coveralls.\n \n He knelt beside her and gently turned her face.\n \n She was unconscious. Broad, dark face, with no make-up; she was apparently in her late thirties. She appeared to be Chinese.\n \n She breathed, a little raggedly but without visible discomfort; her face was relaxed as though she were sleeping. She did not rouse as he moved her.\n \n He realized she was breathing the air of the room they were in.\n \n His instant first thought was that she was in danger of asphyxiation;", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "8", "uid": "c1a34c92350d4698856691522c2e20d6", "response_text": "Herrell McCray is a navigator on the Starship Jodrell Bank heading for the colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine when he is inexplicably abducted from his ship.

He receives a message from his ship several hours later that gives him a glimmer of hope for rescue, but he calculates that he must be five hundred light years away from them to account for the hours-long lag between messages. When the room begins heating up and chlorine gas begins burning his lungs as the aliens administer a survival test, he quickly gets into the spacesuit and breaks out of the room with a large space axe.

He tries to explore the objects with his hands but in frustration, calls out that he wishes he could see, and there is a flicker of pinkish light from a spacesuit. With the light available to him, he looks at the other objects in the room: a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old-fashioned child’s rocking chair, a chemistry set….The objects are somewhat familiar, many of which he had owned himself. Three walls are solid, but the fourth seems to be a grating, perhaps a ventilator. McCray recalls that spacesuits have radios, so he tries to contact his ship but receives no answer. He thinks about the speed of radio transmissions and realizes he must be far away from his ship not to receive an immediate reply. \n\tUnknown to McCray, he has been selected for observation and an experiment by a probe team.

He is also able to see his own body again, which calms him down. He feels the temperature increase, smells a weird, halogenic-like scent, and hears a buzzing, but he ignores it as his spacesuit starts speaking.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n Not to be or not to not be ... that was the not-question for the invader of the not-world.\n \n\n \n Dear Editor:\n \n My 14 year old boy, Ronnie, is typing this letter for me because he can do it neater and use better grammar. I had to get in touch with somebody about this because if there is something to it, then somebody, everybody, is going to point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, \"Why didn't you warn us?\"\n \n I could not go to the police because they are not too friendly to me because of some of my guests who frankly are stew bums. Also they might think I was on booze, too, or maybe the hops, and get my license revoked. I run a strictly legit hotel even though some of my guests might be down on their luck now and then.\n \n What really got me mixed up in this was the mysterious disappearance of two of my guests. They both took a powder last Wednesday morning.\n \n Now get this. In one room, that of Joe Binkle, which maybe is an alias, I find nothing but a suit of clothes, some butts and the letters I include here in same package. Binkle had only one suit. That I know. And this was it laying right in the middle of the room. Inside the coat was the vest, inside the vest the shirt, inside the shirt the underwear. The pants were up in the coat and inside of them was also the underwear. All this was buttoned up like Binkle had melted out of it and dripped through a crack in the floor. In a bureau drawer were the letters I told you about.\n \n Now. In the room right under Binkle's lived another stew bum that checked in Thursday ... name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. This guy was a real case. He brought with him a big mirror with a heavy bronze frame. Airloom, he says. He pays a week in advance, staggers up the stairs to his room with the mirror and that's the last I see of him.\n \n In Smith's room on Wednesday I find only a suit of clothes, the same suit he wore when he came in. In the coat the vest, in the vest the shirt, in the shirt the underwear. Also in the pants. Also all in the middle of the floor. Against the far wall stands the frame of the mirror. Only the frame!\n \n What a spot to be in! Now it might have been a gag. Sometimes these guys get funny ideas when they are on the stuff. But then I read the letters. This knocks me for a loop. They are all in different handwritings. All from different places. Stamps all legit, my kid says. India, China, England, everywhere.\n \n My kid, he reads. He says it's no joke. He wants to call the cops or maybe some doctor. But I say no. He reads your magazine so he says write to you, send you the letters. You know what to do. Now you have them. Maybe you print. Whatever you do, Mr. Editor, remember my place, the Plaza Ritz Arms, is straight establishment. I don't drink. I never touch junk, not even aspirin.\n \n \n Yours very truly, Ivan Smernda\n \n \n\n \n Bombay, India June 8\n \n Mr. Joe Binkle Plaza Ritz Arms New York City\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n Greetings, greetings, greetings. Hold firm in your wretched projection, for tomorrow you will not be alone in the not-world. In two days I, Glmpauszn, will be born.\n \n Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the mirror gateway, torn with the agony that we calculated must go with such tremendous wavelength fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus within the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am static and for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe with fear and trepidation.\n \n As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but got no response. What could have diminished your powers of articulate wave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and returning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing and surrounded with an impregnable chimera.\n \n Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the not-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by what the not-world calls \"mail\" till we meet. For this purpose I must utilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you. Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.\n \n I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary reports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury of facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free of the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in your task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we return again.\n \n The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of Bombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it. Tomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact location, for the not-people might have access to the information.\n \n I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it is alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational likeness.\n \n I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among them. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway lies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in order that I might destroy the not-people completely.\n \n All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too fast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision. Gezsltrysk, what a task!\n \n Farewell till later.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Wichita, Kansas June 13\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you, I see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are no terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in not-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my birth.\n \n Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited equipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor came in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation reigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What difference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me. As they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally, since I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother\n(Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up their hands and left.\n \n I learned the following day that the opposite component of my not-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance during my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a bender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.\n \n When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I made a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36 not-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was standing by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind. He stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of speech.\n \n Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I produced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.\n \n \"Poppa,\" I said.\n \n This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that are now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded low-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have jarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the room.\n \n They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something about my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at the doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth, she fell down heavily. She made a distinct thump on the floor.\n \n This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window and retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched, but I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!\n \n I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the cleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply from Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise indeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats. But you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself and it's his nature never to flatter anyone.\n \n From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the qualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this alleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive mythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people refer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we learned otherwise, while they never have.\n \n New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard time classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to the inevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of the not-world and return to our world a hero. I cannot understand your not replying to my letters. I have given you a box number. What could have happened to your vibrations?\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Albuquerque, New Mexico June 15\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n I had tremendous difficulty getting a letter off to you this time. My process—original with myself, by the way—is to send out feeler vibrations for what these people call the psychic individual. Then I establish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his knowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my letter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he has done.\n \n My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an individual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but I fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell you about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have accomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent.\n \n In simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of sleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz & uhrytzg ... no, it won't come out. Anyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here.\n \n As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ... my brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard time classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire the stuff needed for the destruction of these people.\n \n Sunrise came as I expected. According to my catalog of information, the impressions aroused by it are of beauty. It took little conditioning for me finally to react in this manner. This is truly an efficient mechanism I inhabit.\n \n I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions. It was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried immediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up and all about me at the beauty.\n \n Soon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I simply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was to realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not let yourself believe they do.\n \n This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here. Her hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She wore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was diverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped.\n \n The woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from nearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with an attitude of mild interest. They weren't interested in me, I told myself. But they were.\n \n I became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you unfortunately do not have—invisibility. I lay there and listened.\n \n \"He was stark naked,\" the girl with the sneakers said.\n \n A figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her.\n \n \"Lizzy, you'll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of this area.\"\n \n \"But—\"\n \n \"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy,\" the officer ordered. \"No more speeches in the Square. Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now where is your naked friend? I'm going to make an example of him.\"\n \n That was it—I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this oversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions that assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty, pain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don't know one from the other. I must feel each, become accustomed to it.\n \n The more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I have been given is very unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe. What will Blgftury and the others say of this? My great mission is impaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write you with more enlightenment.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Moscow, Idaho June 17\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greet me in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope, pride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of five bucks!\n \n It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with the correct variant of the slang term \"buck.\" Is it possible that you are powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in this inferior world?\n \n A reminder, please. You and I—I in particular—are now engaged in a struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions of this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have lived a semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world ripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individual fluctuations make up our sentient population.\n \n Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardized by these people. The not-world and our world are like two baskets as you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the greatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides are joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational plane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world of higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples. While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer, more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.\n \n They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves into ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force some of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily, causing them much agony and fright.\n \n The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call mediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one of them at the first opportunity to see for myself.\n \n Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I picked them up while examining the \"slang\" portion of my information catalog which you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimate cause—in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peace of our world—shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short, get hep.\n \n As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Des Moines, Iowa June 19\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages in my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need. Biological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here\n\"revolting\" are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they are all being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the most important part of my journey—completion of the weapon against the not-worlders—I would come to New York immediately. You would rue that day, I assure you.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Boise, Idaho July 15\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n A great deal has happened to me since I wrote to you last. Systematically, I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in our catalog. I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed bending before the winds of passion. In fact, I'm rather badly bent indeed. Ah! You'll pardon me, but I just took time for what is known quaintly in this tongue as a \"hooker of red-eye.\" Ha! I've mastered even the vagaries of slang in the not-language.... Ahhh! Pardon me again. I feel much better now.\n \n You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions that constantly assaulted my mind through this body, I conditioned myself to react exactly as our information catalog instructed me to.\n \n Now it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I am burned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle, I experience a tickle.\n \n This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon me again. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely enough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world came most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thing here, both among those who haven't got it and those who have.\n \n I went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank and carried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the money to a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best hotel here in—no, sorry—and stared at it for hours.\n \n Nothing happened. I didn't love the stuff or feel one way or the other about it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for the love of it.\n \n Anyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten or fifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare rooms filled with money. If I don't love it then, I'll feel I have failed. This alcohol is taking effect now.\n \n Blgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports! I've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I've been studying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics of these people, in the movies. This is the best place to see these people as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and there do homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry.\n \n Love. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.\n \n By the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it won't cost me anything. It'll come out of the pocket of the idiot who's writing this letter. Pretty shrewd of me, eh?\n \n I'm going out and look at that money again. I think I'm at last learning to love it, though not as much as I admire liquor. Well, one simply must persevere, I always say.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Penobscot, Maine July 20\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n Now you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned it in any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across to this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a quart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel wonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.\n \n There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this body and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now I can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today outlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must finally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experiments yet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of the inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss his vibrations.\n \n I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a blonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was attracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is perfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.\n \n I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember distinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I had dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration. We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you believe it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the money in her bare feet! Then we kissed.\n \n Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve ends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these impulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the adrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the entire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.\n \n I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the tingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself quickly.\n \n Now in all the motion pictures—true representations of life and love in this world—the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl and tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses. This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn, wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would have a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?\n \n I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted. Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I had not found love.\n \n I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell asleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin and didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.\n \n I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don't I wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive? I'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is a gin mixture.\n \n I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'll take him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting up an atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do is activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.\n \n Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe, you old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off the fat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Sacramento, Calif. July 25\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n All is lost unless we work swiftly. I received your revealing letter the morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a lot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance things.\n \n Somewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got to the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and continued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again because she said yes immediately.\n \n The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the most frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these people really are to our world.\n \n The medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong psychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I was too busy with the redhead to notice.\n \n Anyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal grandmother, Lucy, from the beyond. The medium went into his act. He concentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in the room.

This medium had actually brought Blgftury partially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in the fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku was open and his btgrimms were down.\n \n Worst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable pattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the redhead.\n \n Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a result of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these not-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality of not-reality. It's true. I cannot do without it now.

I must pick closer points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but failure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula that is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were filled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\n \n I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I realized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction that inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not aware of the nature of my activities.\n \n I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I stuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager I was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best customer.\n \n \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\n \n I was baffled. What could I tell him?\n \n \"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\"\n \n \"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're—they're—\"\n \n \"They're what?\" he wanted to know.\n \n \"They're not safe.\"\n \n \"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\"\n \n At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.\n \n \"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!\"\n \n He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die. Another day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning to think like the not-men, curse them.\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Rochester, New York September 25\n \n Dear Joe:\n \n I have it! It is done! In spite of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury's niggling criticism, I have succeeded. I now have developed a form of mold, somewhat similar to the antibiotics of this world, that, transmitted to the human organism, will cause a disease whose end will be swift and fatal.\n \n First the brain will dissolve and then the body will fall apart. Nothing in this world can stop the spread of it once it is loose. Absolutely nothing.\n \n We must use care. Stock in as much gin as you are able. I will bring with me all that I can. Meanwhile I must return to my original place of birth into this world of horrors. There I will secure the gateway, a large mirror, the vibrational point at which we shall meet and slowly climb the frequency scale to emerge into our own beautiful, now secure world. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators.\n \n You say you eat little and drink as much as you can. The same with me. Even in this revolting world I am a sad sight. My not-world senses falter. This is the last letter. Tomorrow I come with the gateway. When the gin is gone, we will plant the mold in the hotel where you live.\n \n In only a single gleeb it will begin to work. The men of this queer world will be no more. But we can't say we didn't have some fun, can we, Joe?\n \n And just let Blgftury make one crack. Just one xyzprlt. I'll have hgutry before the ghjdksla!\n \n \n Glmpauszn\n \n \n\n \n Dear Editor:\n \n These guys might be queer drunk hopheads. But if not?

Ivan recounts an occurrence in the Plaza Ritz Arms where two alcoholic guests that he calls “stew bums”, Joe Binkle and Ed Smith (an alias for Glmpauszn), mysteriously disappeared, leaving their suits behind as if they had melted out of them. Ed had checked in with a mirror with a heavy bronze frame. After their disappearance, Ivan found only their clothes, the frame of the mirror in Ed’s room, and a stack of letters in the bureau in Joe’s room, which are the letters that tell the remaining story.\nThe vibrational plane of an alien world extends into Earth’s (which they call the not-world), allowing intrusive vibrations from Earth to semi-terrorize sentient alien vibrations. Human spiritual mediums can force psychic reproductions of themselves into the alien world, and conversely pull alien vibrations over the “fringe”. The aliens can’t tolerate it, and send Glmpauszn and Joe to take on human form and develop a chemical weapon to kill all humans.\nGlmpauszn crosses the fringe through a vibrational gateway that allows his consciousness to move into a newborn baby. Joe has already arrived in human form. Glmpauszn quickly grows the baby into an adult man. At three days old, he is 36 inches tall and talking, and a couple of days later is an adult man. Glmpauszn writes to Joe by controlling the minds of sleeping people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. He wonders why Joe won’t write to him, and can’t contact him spiritually, like normal, since Joe has fallen into alcoholism. Glmpauszn forgets to wear clothes and is nearly arrested, but escapes by becoming invisible. When Joe finally writes, it is to ask for money, enraging Glmpauszn who reports Joe’s actions to their boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn becomes distracted by exploring human emotions like intimacy with women and love of money, which causes him to rob a bank and fill 18 rooms of a hotel with money. He also falls into alcoholism. Blgftury is accidentally summoned into a seance by a human medium who pulls Blgftury’s vibrations through the fringe (the very thing they are trying to stop from happening), and Glmpauszn is caught with a red-haired woman by his boss not doing his job.

In both cases, two men checked into the hotel and then mysteriously disappeared, leaving all of their belongings behind, including the clothes they were wearing. The man who owns the hotel doesn’t want to involve the police for fear of reprisals against him; therefore, he sends the letters to the magazine, hoping they will print them. \n\tThe rest of the story is a series of letters, all addressed to Joe Binkle but written in different handwritings and from other parts of the US and the world. They trace the progress of a being named Glmpauszn who, in the first letter, is preparing to be born so that he can enter human society. Once he is born, he grows quickly, and within days, he escapes the hospital and hides in a cave until he has grown into a man. At that point, he makes his way to a chemist to procure the chemicals he needs for his mission: to destroy humanity for encroaching on his world. He walks down the street trying to act normal, but a young lady sees him and begins screaming: he has forgotten to wear clothes. Glmpauszn blames part of his failure on Joe, who apparently is supposed to provide him with the background information he needs to succeed.\n\tGlmpauszn often comments that he has yet to receive a return letter from Joe, but when he does, he complains that Joe has asked him for a $5.00 loan. Glmpauszn refuses the loan initially, making much of the fact that Joe didn’t greet him or express pleasure at his arrival. Glmpauszn alludes to the fact that humans have encroached on their world through the use of mediums or spiritualists. \n\tGlmpauszn takes time to experience various aspects of humanity, including emotions and impressions, such as love of money, love, beauty, pain, etc. He thinks he is on the verge of love until he suggests a biological exploration of it and the women say yes, leading him to conclude it isn’t love. In the meantime, Glmpauszn drinks more and more and accidentally sets off an explosion in his hotel rooms. \n\tGlmpauszn keeps Joe up to date on what he is doing but complains about Blgrtury’s criticism and demands for reports.

The letter's author, Ivan Smernda, owns a hotel called Plaza Ritz Arms, and recently two of his guests mysteriously vanished leaving behind several letters, a mirror frame without the mirror, and each of their suit of clothes, perfectly intact. The men are named Ed Smith and Joe Binkle, although Ivan guesses these are aliases. Ivan shares the men's letters with the editor in the hopes that they will be printed and serve as a warning for humanity. The first letter reveals Ed Smith's true name, which is Glmpauszn. Glmpauszn and Joe are Frequencies, ghost-like entities that exist in a spirit dimension adjacent to human reality. Due to the rise of humans using the services of mediums and fortune tellers to make contact with loved ones in the spirit world, the Frequencies feel terrorized. Glmpauszn has been sent to inhabit the human dimension, what he calls the \"not-world\", in order to find a way to destroy humanity and end its assault upon the vibrations of the Frequencies. Joe has already spent several \"gleebs\" (an unspecified amount of time) on Earth studying human ways in order to prepare Glmpauszn for his mission. They write to each other by possessing the minds and bodies of sleeping humans who can translate the language and write the letters. Glmpauszn details how he attuned himself to a human fetus and then sped up the growing process upon his birth, believing that the speed of his growth would impress his not-mother and not-father. Instead, he only frightens them both, and he runs away to a cave whereupon he accelerates his growth until he becomes an adult. As he begins to seek out a chemist to help him begin to plan the destruction of humanity, he runs into a woman who screams when she sees he is totally naked. Embarrassed, Glmpauszn lashes out at Joe, complaining that he has not prepared him sufficiently for his mission, and he must better learn human customs and emotions. He slowly adapts the forms and impressions of the human dimension. Not only does he love drinking hard liquor, but he also uses his invisibility power to rob a bank and fill his eighteen-room suite at the hotel with money. As Glmpauszn grows increasingly enamored with the human experience, he begins to neglect his mission, including reporting to his boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn drinks excessively and starts to court women, seeking out the elusive feeling of love. One night he even attends a seance, and the medium summons Blgftury, who glares at him in anger. As Glmpauszn falls deeper into alcoholism, his neglect of the mission becomes so bad that he accidentally blows up his suite of rooms at the hotel. Eventually, he devises a kind of mold that can cause a fatal disease to spread throughout the planet.

Glmpauszn doesn’t have much respect for Blgftury and envisions an incident where Blgftury is present as an olive and is eaten by the blonde girl. \nAt a seance that Glmpauszn attends, the medium actually brings Blgftury across when she is trying to bring over a woman’s grandmother. Blgftury looks angry and sees Glmpauszn, peering at him with an expression of pain, anger, fear, and amazement. At the end of the story, Glmpauszn has succeeded in his mission of creating a way to destroy the human race in the form of a mold. This mold will dissolve the brain and then cause the body to fall apart. Glmpauszn is pleased to have succeeded, and he dares Blgftury to make any criticism against what he has accomplished. \n"}, {"worker_id": "12", "uid": "461d6a004d694cb09b5b06532aba5a67", "response_text": "Blgftury is the alien in charge of this operation to destroy the \"not-world,\" which the reader would know better as Earth.

There isn’t anything that Judy can’t solve.”\n \n \n Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe she’d understand—understand any better than I do. Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no exception.”\n \n \n “You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t solve.”\n \n \n “Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—”\n \n \n “Judy Dobbs, remember?”\n \n \n “Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved all those mysteries. I met you when the whole valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened by flood and you solved that—”\n \n \n “That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace, not me. He was the hero without even meaning to be. He was the one who rode through town and warned people that the flood was coming. I was off chasing a shadow.”\n \n \n “A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh.\n“What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.”\n \n \n “It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.\n“I know now that keeping that promise not to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.”\n \n \n “Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”\n \n \n “Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk about?”\n \n \n “You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or two before the flood, but what about the haunted\n house you moved into? You were the one who tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”\n \n \n “Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,\n“there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but what she was or how she spoke to me is more than I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling. And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them. They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re stored in one end of the attic.”\n \n \n “Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and show up the spooks?”\n \n \n “I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”\n \n \n Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries, but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally told them, the summer before they met. Horace had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton Lee, who gave him his job with the Farringdon Daily Herald . He had turned in some interesting church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n \n \n Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she confessed now as she reviewed everything that had happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact that her parents left her every summer while they went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they think she would do?\n \n \n “You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery series you like. When they’re finished there are plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother never throws anything away. She has magazines she’s saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for them she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how you love to read.”\n \n \n “I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—”\n \n \n Judy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too little to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t glad to have her.\n \n \n “You here again?” she had greeted her that summer, and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with yourself this time?”\n \n \n “Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say you have a whole stack of old magazines—”\n \n \n “In the attic. Go up and look them over if you can stand the heat.”\n \n \n Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so much as to escape to a place where she could have a good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth birthday. In another year she would have outgrown her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a vacation of her own. In another year she would be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands and solving a mystery to be known as the Ghost Parade .\n \n \n “A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling her, “and you solved everything.”\n \n \n But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen on a picture of a fountain.\n \n \n “A fountain with tears for water. How strange!” she remembered saying aloud.\n \n \n Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a fountain still caught and held rainbows like those she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls. But all that was in the future. If anyone had told the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in their faces.\n \n \n “That tease!”\n \n \n For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so are you!”\n \n \n Peter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him. The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing, she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n \n \n “But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”\n \n \n A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n“Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people know your wishes instead of muttering them to yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”\n \n \n “Were they?” asked Lois.\n \n \n She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what Judy was telling them without interruption.\n \n \n “That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.\n“There weren’t any of them impossible.”\n \n \n And she went on to tell them how, the very next day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it. Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy had stared at them a moment and then climbed the steps to the pool.\n \n \n “Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.\n“Is this beautiful fountain real?”\n \n \n A voice had answered, although she could see no one.\n \n \n “Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely come true.”\n \n \n “A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”\n \n \n “Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will surely come true,” the voice had repeated.\n \n \n “But what is there to cry about?”\n \n \n “You found plenty to cry about back at your grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up there in the attic?”\n \n \n “Then you—you are the fountain!” Judy remembered exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It doesn’t have a voice.”\n \n \n “Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had said in a mysterious whisper.\n \n \n\n CHAPTER II\n \n If Wishes Came True\n \n “Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n“Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any longer. What did you wish?”\n \n \n “Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming to that.”\n \n \n First, she told her friends, she had to think of a wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved away.\n \n \n “You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before they vanished, and so I began naming the things I wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton, and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to think of others that my wishes started to come true.”\n \n \n “But what were they?” Lois insisted.\n \n \n Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful. Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything more.”\n \n \n “Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois asked.\n \n \n “Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep pets, and have a nice home, and—”\n \n \n “And your wishes all came true!”\n \n \n “Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That seemed impossible at the time, but the future did hold a sister for me.”\n \n \n “It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”\n \n \n “Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”\n \n \n “Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was enchanted?”\n \n \n Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so at the time. I wandered around, growing very drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain had been a dream.”\n \n \n “A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it wasn’t a flying carpet?”\n \n \n “No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick with roses. Did I tell you it was June?”\n \n \n “All the year around?”\n \n \n Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n“Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long way from June to December.”\n \n \n “Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too, and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens. I explored the garden all around the fountain.”\n \n \n “And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.\n \n \n “Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t you try to solve the mystery?”\n \n \n “I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if I had been older or more experienced. I really should have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine was your friend.”\n \n \n “I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.\n“It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”\n \n \n “It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that things started happening so fast that I completely forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t believe I thought about it again until after we moved to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and saw the fountain on your lawn.”\n \n \n “The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,” Lois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.”\n \n \n “You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve seen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll show you.”\n \n \n Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while Judy was telling them the story of the fountain. Somehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had tasted it too often while she was making it.\n \n \n “I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided.\n \n \n Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously with cream.\n \n \n “Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine? He wants to explore the attic, too.”\n \n \n “He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.\n \n \n Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was removed. But there was still a door closing off the narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n \n \n “He can read my mind. He always knows where I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling noise came from the floor above.\n \n \n “Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid of,” Judy urged her friends.\n \n \n “Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,” confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing room at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n \n \n “So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious about black cats, but they are creepy. Does Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”\n \n \n “Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy. Pausing at still another door that led to the darker part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n“Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody care to explore the past?”\n \n \n The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy relating still more of what she remembered about the fountain.\n \n \n “When I told Grandma about it she laughed and said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those you see on that high shelf by the window. I think she and Grandpa like the way they lived without any modern conveniences or anything.”\n \n \n “I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died the same winter, isn’t it?”\n \n \n “Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they wished neither of them would outlive the other. If they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes. Another could have been to keep the good old days, as Grandma used to call them. That one came true in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the past when they kept all these old things. That’s what I meant about turning back the clock.”\n \n \n “If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little myself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things were the way they used to be when I trusted Arthur—”\n \n \n “Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked.\n \n \n Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed monster coming between her and her handsome husband, Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It is. It’s the very same one.”\n \n \n “But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!” Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”\n \n \n “I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home. But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way. If she did, she pretended not to.\n \n \n “Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love to, wouldn’t you, Judy?”\n \n \n “I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.\n“Do you recognize it, too?”\n \n \n “I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little more closely the picture they had found. “It looks like the fountain on the Brandt estate.”\n \n \n “The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned.\n“Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny all the way to Farringdon.”\n \n \n “Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you come into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.”\n \n \n “Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly to her friends. “I do remember a road turning off into the woods and going on uphill,” she told them.\n“I never thought it led to a house, though. There isn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents took?”\n \n \n “Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?” Lois suggested.\n \n \n\n CHAPTER III\n \n A Strange Encounter\n \n Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to it under one condition. They were not to drive all the way to the house which, she said, was just over the hilltop. They were to park the car where no one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\n \n \n “But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.\n \n \n “You’ll remember it, won’t you?”\n \n \n Judy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure. She and Lois both argued that it would be better to inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\n \n \n “She’d be glad to show us around. This way it looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they started off in the blue car she was driving.\n \n \n It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed and said if they did find the fountain she thought she’d wish for one exactly like it.\n \n \n “Well, you know what your grandmother said about wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you let people know about them instead of muttering them to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.”\n \n \n “Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know about this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur coat he gave me last year.”\n \n \n “Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this trip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\n \n \n The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they had covered the distance that had seemed such a long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s wagon.\n \n \n “I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\n some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t explain what happened afterwards. When I woke up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse, wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”\n \n \n “How could they?” asked Lois.\n \n \n “Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to see how beautiful everything was before—”\n \n \n Again she broke off as if there were something she wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare.\n \n \n “Before what?” questioned Judy.\n \n \n “Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You were telling us how you woke up in the hammock, but you never did explain how you got back home,” Lorraine reminded her.\n \n \n “Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it, but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember driving home along this road. You see, I thought my grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise and would return for me. I told you I was all alone. There wasn’t a house in sight.”\n \n \n “The Brandt house is just over the top of this next hill,” Lois put in.\n \n \n “I know. You told me that. Now I know why I couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally, I followed it. There’s something about a path in the woods that always tempts me.”\n \n \n “We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”\n \n \n “Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where the hammock was and then through an archway,” Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes peered out at me from unexpected places. I was actually scared by the time I reached the old tower. There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he was driving off without me.”\n \n \n “He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise, and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like that?”\n \n \n “I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.\n“The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.”\n \n \n “I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\n \n \n “Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s another car coming.”\n \n \n As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind Judy until the car had passed. The man driving it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered most of his hair.\n \n \n “What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois when the car had passed. “Aren’t you a little old for playing hide and seek?”\n \n \n “I wasn’t—playing. Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there any more.”\n \n \n “Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do, can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly.\n \n \n She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\n \n \n Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond. The sky was gray with white clouds being driven across it by the wind.\n \n \n “There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can see it over to the left. It looks like something out of Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?”\n \n \n “It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder what it is.”\n \n \n “I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But if there are new people living here they’ll never give us permission.”\n \n \n “We might explore it without permission,” Judy suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for the fountain.”\n \n \n “Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It won’t be enchanted. I told you—”\n \n \n “You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If you know anything about the people who live here now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise, I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.”\n \n \n “I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember Roger Banning from school, don’t you? I’ve seen him around here. His family must have acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on the estate.”\n \n \n “Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places together.”\n \n \n “It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively.\n“I was just out for a drive.”\n \n \n “You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better than that. I did know him slightly, but not from school. The boys and girls were separated and went to different high schools by the time we moved to\n Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a lot better. He was in our young people’s group at church.”\n \n \n “Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.”\n \n \n “For what?” asked Judy.\n \n \n Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts to gossip.\n \n \n “Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important business people. I think he forged some legal documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary. It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.\n \n \n Now Judy did remember. It was something she would have preferred to forget.

She discovered a photo of a spectacular fountain in her grandmother’s hot attic one summer as she was stuck there for two weeks while her parents went on vacation. She shed a tear onto the photo while recalling her sadness about not having friends or a sister, and imagined the fountain was a place for lonely girls to fill with their tears. Her grandmother overhears her speaking aloud her wishes and calls that she shouldn’t keep her wishes to herself, because “most of them aren’t so impossible.”\nJudy’s grandparents take her to the fountain in the photo and it speaks to Judy, directing her to shed a tear into it and make wishes. Judy sheds a tear thinking about how her only friend just moved out of town and then hurries through her wishes before the ripples disappear - to have lots of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. All things that have come true in her life.\nAbruptly returning to Judy’s modern timeline, she takes Lois and Lorraine to the attic. They are spooked by Judy’s black cat, Blackberry, who makes sudden noises. Judy finds the photo and Lorraine recognizes the fountain is identical to one on her estate - yet it is in a different location. They surmise that it is in the woods on the edge of town that are part of the Brandt estate, and drive to it immediately.\nDuring their adventure, Judy recalls more of her fountain memory. Her grandparents didn’t know the Brandt’s well enough to pay them a visit, but instead stopped by the fountain on their way to drop off her grandmother’s hooked rugs at the estate further up the path. Judy was left behind napping in a hammock - told by her grandparents they were getting her a surprise, but they didn’t return. She followed a path to an old windowless tower, but got distracted by the sound of her grandfather's cart leaving. This is all she recalls, but there is evidently more to discover that will solve the mystery.\nThe trip to the fountain shakes the confidence of Lorraine in the back seat, who knows information about the new owners of the estate - Roger Banning - that she is withholding. Lois and Judy probe her about what she knows and why she ducked down to hide her face from a stranger passing in a car. Although Lorraine tells them about Roger, she does not reveal why she is afraid. Judy mentions knowing Roger’s pal Dick Hartwell, who is apparently in the Federal Penitentiary for forgery now.

When Judy was growing up, her parents would spend summers on vacation without her, so she did a lot of reading at her Grandmother Smeed's house. These were sad summers for her, but she would soon start to solve mysteries and find her own adventures. She mentioned her tears falling on a magazine with a picture of a fountain; she imagined it was full of tears of many girls and pondered the idea of an enchanted fountain. Her grandparents took her to see a fountain the next day, where she heard a voice that told her to make a wish and to cry into the fountain--the same fountain that was in the picture in the magazine. Judy's friends got more excited about the story, and it continued: she had to think of a wise wish, but reacted too quickly to think carefully. Her wishes did come true; she wanted lots of friends, a sister, to solve mysteries, and to marry a G-man. All of these things came true, and the fountain kept Judy captivated. She patiently explained to her friends that she hadn't tried to learn the secret of the fountain, and it didn't speak to her after the initial encounter. Judy had lost her appetite for her dessert but wanted to retrieve the photo of the fountain to see if Lois recognized it; they all went to the attic, bringing Blackberry the cat with them. Lorraine recognized the photo of the fountain, but it seemed to make her nervous. Lois didn't want to leave yet even though Lorraine was clearly uncomfortable and wanted to go, and thought she might recognize the fountain from the Brandt estate, so Lois and Judy decide it's worth checking out to see if it's the same one. Lorraine only agreed to join after they promised not to drive all the way up to the house, and to walk the last part of the way. After a twenty-minute drive, Judy talked more about what she remembered about the day she visited the garden; she'd fallen asleep in a hammock, and woke up to an empty garden. She headed towards a tower but found her grandfather's car before she encountered anyone. Through all of this, Lorraine hints that she knows more than she's letting on, and doesn't think things will be as Judy expected. This is when Judy picks up on Lorraine's reticence. Judy and Lois want to explore the old tower and look for the fountain, when Lois admits she knows Roger Banning has been around the area.

On top of that, she claims that Judy almost ruined their double wedding. Judy enters at the end of the conversation, admitting that she has problems, too, and hasn’t been able to solve all the mysteries she has attempted. When Judy mentions a promise she made not to discuss the dam and that she should have told Arthur, Lorraine has a pained expression and asks them not to talk about him.\nLois changes the subject, praising Judy’s mystery-solving and ghost tracking abilities that she then explains sensibly; she asks Judy to tell them a story about one of her mysteries. Judy tells them about the haunted fountain that she saw when she was fifteen years old and spending part of the summer with her grandparents while her parents were on vacation. In the attic to look at some of her grandmother’s old magazines, Judy began feeling sorry for being left behind and started crying. Her tear fell onto a picture of a fountain, and she pretended it was filled with the tears of lonely girls. Aloud, she comments that would make the fountain enchanted and starts to say a wish when her grandmother interrupts to tell her that if she let people know her wishes, most of them wouldn’t be impossible to fulfill.\nThe next day, Judy’s grandparents took her to a fountain that looked just like the one in the magazine. Judy walked into it and heard a voice telling her that if she sheds a tear in the fountain and makes a wish, her wish will come true. But the voice admonishes her to wish wisely.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n No doubt whatever about it, I had the Indian sign on me ... my comfortably untidy world had suddenly turned into a monstrosity of order!\n \n \n \n When I got home from the office, I was not so much tired as beaten down, but the effect is similar. I let myself into the apartment, which had an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown temperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but according to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got dressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my wife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.\n \n What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I've vacuumed the carpet, I've dusted and I've straightened the cushions.... Ah! The ashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still the place looked wife-deserted.\n \n It had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I'd had to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios I write for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella when I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost tropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a woman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.\n \n \"Madison and Fifty-fourth,\" I said.\n \n \"Right,\" said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go on grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. \"Sorry, Mac. You'll have to find another cab. Good hunting.\"\n \n If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over my hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held me up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform, just in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one which exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing happened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain had stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.\n \n \n\n \n As I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where they were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the usual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular, a man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay. While I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was able to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size of an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight, and then his chattering drill hit it.\n \n There was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on his back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the moment of the explosion—if so feeble a thing can be called one—I felt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my hand. I mopped at it with my handkerchief but, though slight, the bleeding would not stop, so I went into a drugstore and bought some pink adhesive which I put on the tiny cut. When I got to the studio, I found that I had missed the story conference.\n \n During the day, by actual count, I heard the phrase \"I'm just spitballing\" eight times, and another Madison Avenue favorite,\n\"The whole ball of wax,\" twelve times. However, my story had been accepted without change because nobody had noticed my absence from the conference room. There you have what is known as the Advertising World, the Advertising game or the advertising racket, depending upon which rung of the ladder you have achieved.\n \n The subway gave a repeat performance going home, and as I got to the apartment house we live in, the cop on the afternoon beat was standing there talking to the doorman.\n \n He said, \"Hello, Mr. Graham. I guess you must have just have missed it at your office building.\" I looked blank and he explained, \"We just heard it a little while ago: all six elevators in your building jammed at the same time. Sounds crazy. I guess you just missed it.\"\n \n Anything can happen in advertising, I thought. \"That's right, Danny, I just missed it,\" I said, and went on in.\n \n Psychiatry tells us that some people are accident-prone; I, on the other hand, seemed recently to be coincidence-prone, fluke-happy, and except for the alarm clock, I'd had no control over what had been going on.\n \n I went into our little kitchen to make a drink and reread the directions Molly had left, telling me how to get along by myself until she got back from her mother's in Oyster Bay, a matter of ten days. How to make coffee, how to open a can, whom to call if I took sick and such. My wife used to be a trained nurse and she is quite convinced that I cannot take a breath without her. She is right, but not for the reasons she supposes.\n \n I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: \"When you take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door, too.\"\n \n Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in front of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate me from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil. When I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the manuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The pencil was standing on its end.\n \n \n\n \n There, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hear about, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and drank some of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the muggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter to try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last sentence.\n \n Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising. My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's notes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed one that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: \"Garbage picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I love you.\" What can you do when the girl loves you?\n \n I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window at the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was exercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be allowed to perch, but were not allowed to.\n \n Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that their wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking about this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn, they seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all wanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and fell.\n \n The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and picked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side, stroking its feathers.\n \n My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were interrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is usually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like an incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that of my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has never, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late afternoon.\n \n \"You can't say a thing like that to me!\" I heard him shout. \"I tell you I got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we started to play!\"\n \n Several other loud voices started at the same time.\n \n \"Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!\"\n \n \"Yeah, and only when you were dealer!\"\n \n The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened the door to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confronting him, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and the impulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and he looked stunned.\n \n \"Here!\" he said, holding out a deck of cards, \"For Pete's sake, look at\n'em yourselves if you think they're marked!\"\n \n The nearest man struck them up from his hand. \"Okay, Houdini! So they're not marked! All I know is five straight....\"\n \n His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards on the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the rest face up—all red.\n \n \n\n \n Someone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and the four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence, got in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly arranged cards.\n \n \"Judas!\" he said, and started to pick them up. \"Will you look at that! My God, what a session....\"\n \n I helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it, but I had an idea what I would hear.\n \n After a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed.\n \n \"Never seen anything to equal it,\" he said. \"Wouldn't have believed it. Those guys didn't believe it. Every round normal, nothing unusual about the hands—three of a kind, a low straight, that sort of thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be my deal. Brother! Straight flush to the king—every time! And each time, somebody else has four aces....\"\n \n He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There was one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top broke and glass chips got into the bottle.\n \n \"I'll have to go down for more soda,\" I said.\n \n \"I'll come, too. I need air.\"\n \n At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in what must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the top of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the tile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from at least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and I was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth open and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his mouth open.\n \n \n\n \n On the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie his shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi swerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded, its rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign cars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any side-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to rest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that moment.\n \n The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and the taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged crosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either forward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi to a lamp.\n \n Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at all, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues. Everyone was honking his horn.\n \n Danny was furious—more so when he tried to put through a call to his station house from the box opposite.\n \n It was out of order.\n \n \n\n \n Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the windows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had brightened up considerably.\n \n \"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,\" he said.\n\"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned and nodded toward the pandemonium.\n \n When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except one. That was tied in three knots.\n \n All right , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university uptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he knows everything.\n \n When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought, more trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's voice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were connected. That's a damn funny coincidence.\"\n \n \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I've got something for you to work on.\"\n \n \"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—\"\n \n \"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.\"\n \n \"At once,\" he said, and hung up.\n \n While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of my novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a point where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter\n\"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to the side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.\n \n This was absolutely not my day.\n \n \n\n \n \"Well,\" McGill said, \"nothing you've told me is impossible or supernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against that poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him. It's all those other things....\"\n \n He got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight while I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.\n \n \"Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at what I'm going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely, and the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that you're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion.\" I started to get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. \"I know, but don't you see that that is far more likely than....\" He stopped and shook his head. Then he brightened. \"I have an idea. Maybe we can have a demonstration.\"\n \n He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. \"Have you any change on you?\"\n \n \"Why, yes,\" I said. \"Quite a bit.\" I reached into my pocket. There must have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. \"Do you think they'll each have the same date, perhaps?\"\n \n \"Did you accumulate all that change today?\"\n \n \"No. During the week.\"\n \n He shook his head. \"In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you could have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that would be actually impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll tell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if they all come up heads.\"\n \n I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the floor. They clattered and bounced—and bounced together—and stacked themselves into a neat pile.\n \n I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.\n \n These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line, the adjacent ones touching.\n \n \"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\"\n \n \"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the Universe—random and design. The sands on the beach are an example of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of Thermodynamics—quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast; it's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental manifestation.\"\n \n \"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is controlling the coins and—the other things?\"\n \n \n\n \n He shook his head. \"No. All I mean is that improbable things usually have improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken, I don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the book of rules. Something—I don't know what—is going on, and it seems to involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you still in that building when the elevators stuck? Or near it?\"\n \n \"I guess I must have been. It happened just after I left.\"\n \n \"Hm. You're the center, all right. But why?\"\n \n \"Center of what?\" I asked. \"I feel as though I were the center of an electrical storm. Something has it in for me!\"\n \n McGill grinned. \"Don't be superstitious. And especially don't be anthropomorphic.\"\n \n \"Well, if it's the opposite of random, it's got to be a form of life.\"\n \n \"On what basis? All we know for certain is that random motions are being rearranged. A crystal, for example, is not life, but it's a non-random arrangement of particles.... I wonder.\" He had a faraway, frowning look.\n \n I was beginning to feel hungry and the drinks had worn off.\n \n \"Let's go out and eat,\" I said, \"There's not a damn thing in the kitchen and I'm not allowed to cook. Only eggs and coffee.\"\n \n We put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we could hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were, by this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we heard one of them say to Danny, \"I don't know what the hell's going on around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it. They can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen anything like it.\"\n \n Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they tried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let the other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had embarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were replaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.\n \n \"All right, smart guy!\" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead, only to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches which met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts ever witnessed—a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything else, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical excuses and threats.\n \n \n\n \n Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. \"You all right, Mr. Graham?\" he asked. \"I don't know what's going on around here, but ever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!\" he shouted—he could succeed as a hog-caller. \"Bring those dames over here!\"\n \n Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas intertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over fenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the ladies seemed not to be.\n \n \"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my umbrella and we'll say no more about it!\"\n \n \"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary.\n \n The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also caught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the other two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go, but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was Molly. My nurse-wife.\n \n \"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all right?\" Was I all right!\n \n \"Molly! What are you doing here?\"\n \n \"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to think.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\"\n \n \"Of course I'm all right. But why....\"\n \n \"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's number and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced and it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got a busy signal. Oh, dear, are you sure you're all right?\"\n \n I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look. Then I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast to it.\n \n \"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said.\n \n When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said.\n\"And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.\"\n \n He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was a jump ahead of him.\n \n \"In other words, you think it's something organic?\"\n \n \"Well,\" McGill said, \"I'm trying to think of anything else it might be. I'm not doing so well,\" he confessed.\n \n \"But so far as I can see,\" Molly answered, \"it's mere probability, and without any over-all pattern.\"\n \n \"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.\"\n \n \n\n \n Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. \"Do you feel all right, darling?\" she asked me. I nodded brightly. \"You'll think this silly of me,\" she went on to McGill, \"but why isn't it something like an overactive poltergeist?\"\n \n \"Pure concept,\" he said. \"No genuine evidence.\"\n \n \"Magnetism?\"\n \n \"Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't magnetic—and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy, and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field, all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than that—they go on moving.\"\n \n \"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?\"\n \n \"Only an analogy,\" said McGill. \"A crystal resembles life in that it has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree this—thing—has no discernible shape and motion is involved, but plants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but it does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a non-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and it has a nucleus and it seems to be growing—at least in what you might call improbability.\"\n \n Molly frowned. \"Then what is it? What's it made of?\"\n \n \"I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about the atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to be forming around a nucleus not of its own material—the way a speck of sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of crystallization.\"\n \n \"Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,\" Molly said, and gave me an impertinent look.\n \n \"Why,\" I asked McGill, \"did you say the coins couldn't have the same date? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.\"\n \n \"Because I don't think this thing got going before today and everything that's happened can all be described as improbable motions here and now. The dates were already there, and to change them would require retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book. That telephone now—\"\n \n The doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephone repairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen.\n \n \"I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister,\" he said with strong disapproval.\n \n \"Certainly not,\" I said. \"Is it broken?\"\n \n \"Not exactly broken , but—\" He shook his head and took it apart some more.\n \n \n\n \n McGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally the man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried to explain to me what had happened with the phone.\n \n \"You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the receiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open.\"\n \n \"But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long time! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her nearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay.\"\n \n \"Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the floor—something like that—just happened to cause the right induction impulses. Yes, I know how you feel,\" he said, seeing my expression.\n\"It's beginning to bear down.\"\n \n Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was so pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry.\n \n \"I'm in no mood to cook,\" she said. \"Let's get away from all this.\"\n \n McGill raised an eyebrow. \"If all this, as you call it, will let us.\"\n \n In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.\n \n \"I've been put on the story—who could be better?—I live here. So far, I don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny, but he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in some mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?\"\n \n \"He's got a theory,\" said Molly. \"Come and eat with us and he'll tell you all about it.\"\n \n Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth Avenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than before and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant, and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the lieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.\n \n \"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham,\" Danny said, \"it's at the station house. What there's left of it, that is.\"\n \n Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt the speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of cigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I happened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before I could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the sidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but said nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.\n \n When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool—although it didn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door and ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the next table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green evening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter returned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold cuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfait for the fat lady.\n \n I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used instead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and made faces.\n \n \n\n \n The waiter was concerned and apologetic, and took the drinks back to the bar across the room. The bartender looked over at us and tasted one of the drinks. Then he dumped them in his sink with a puzzled expression and made a new batch. After shaking this up, he set out a row of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour.\n \n That is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing came out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again. Still nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his pick, his face pink with exasperation.\n \n I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice is a crystal, I thought to myself.\n \n The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing happened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar crowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back, baffled, saying he'd have the drinks in a moment, and went to the kitchen. When he returned, he had madame's vichyssoise and some rolls, which he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had grown larger.\n \n Molly lit a cigarette and said, \"I suppose this is all part of it, Alec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here.\"\n \n It was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter—a background noise had stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of the air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made a gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly's when she tapped her cigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring vichyssoise.\n \n \"Hey! What's the idea?\" snarled the sour-looking man.\n \n \"I'm terribly sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident. I—\"\n \n \"Throwing cigarettes at people!\" the fat lady said.\n \n \"I really didn't mean to,\" I began again, getting up. There must have been a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff buttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely set tables, I pulled everything—tablecloth, silver, water glasses, ashtrays and the vichyssoise-à-la-nicotine—onto the floor.\n \n The fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man licked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The owner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us with a determined manner. I tried to explain what had happened, but I was outshouted, and the owner frowned darkly.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "26b7ab68cba049ae80cd2efc54532e51", "response_text": "Alec Graham returns to his home from the office after a long day. His wife Molly has left, and he still feels that it looks wife-deserted even after doing many chores to clean it up. He recounts his bad day, having forgotten to set his alarm and rushing to the TV Studio that he writes for. The taxi driver refuses to take him to Madison and Fifty-fourth, and the rain has gotten worse. His hand continuously bleeds after passing by a big excavation site, and he misses his story conference. After hearing the same phrases numerous times and all six elevators being jammed, he is convinced that he is coincidence prone. Molly leaves him instructions on how to take care of himself, and he works on his novel. More of these events happen with pigeons colliding and somebody getting five straight-flushes in a row. Nat tells Alec about the strange occurrence as they get soda. The three bottles do not break after falling at least five feet, and Danny, the cop, is shocked. Outside, more strange events occur when Nat almost gets caught up with a swerving taxi. Once they return home, he immediately calls McGill, an assistant mathematics professor for some expert advice. Once McGill arrives, he says that all of the events are very improbable, which makes him inclined to believe that Alec is stringing him on or subject to delusion. They do an experiment involving coin-throwing, and all of the coins are arranged in a neat pile when Alec throws them. McGill asks him some more questions about any recent occurrences, but Alec suggests that they go outside to eat. Outside, the cars are being towed away, while two pedestrians are having trouble letting each other pass. Danny is confused by all that is happening. Alec also runs into Molly, stuck in a confused wrangle of umbrellas with two other women. She explains that somebody from their home had kept calling her mother’s number, so she came back to investigate. Back at the apartment, all of this is traced back to Alec as the center. McGill tries to explain what is possibly happening to Alec, but they are interrupted by the telephone repairman. Molly suggests they go out to a restaurant to eat, and Nat comes along. They pass by the car jam again, and the police lieutenant looks at Alec with interest. Even at the restaurant, Alec realizes that his Tom Collins drink is made with salt instead of sugar. When the bartender tries to remake the drink for them, the shaker has frozen solid. It happens again with a new shaker, and the waiter is extremely confused. When Alec’s hand collides with Molly’s cigarette, it goes into the neighboring lady’s vichyssoise. The two of them are displeased, and when Alec stands up, he ends up pulling all of the contents on their entire table onto the floor.

He recalls the events from earlier that day; he had forgotten to set his alarm clock, making him late for a conference at the advertising studio he works at. He had forgotten an umbrella and found himself in the pouring rain, where he caught a taxi only for it to not start. The subways had suffered delays as well. On his walk to the office, Alec passed by a construction site, where he was nicked by a piece of glass from an explosion. He ended up missing his conference, and on his way home, a cop tells him that the elevators in his office building had all broken down as soon as he left. Alec reflects on these events, perplexed by the accident-prone coincidences. He decides to write at his typewriter when he drops his pencil, finding that it has landed standing on its end. As he continues to be stunned by the events, he fixes a drink for himself, taking note of the several notes that his wife, Molly, had left him while she visits her mother. Alec then witnesses a card game between his neighbor, Nat, and a group of men, in which Nat draws five straight flushes. Alec invites Nat in after the heated game, and after breaking a soda, they go to the corner store to buy more, where the bottles fall through the bottom of the bag. As the two walk back to their apartment, Nat is nearly bumped into and he steps onto the curb, causing a severe accident between multiple cars. Nat later leaves to his office to write an article about the strange events, and Alec calls up McGill, a mathematics professor and friend. McGill comes to Alec's apartment, and he is suspicious that he may be delusional or lying, due to the impossible probability of the events occurring. McGill then tosses some change onto the floor, testing to see if they all land on heads; instead, the coins stack up on top of each other. McGill is also confused, trying to imagine an explanation, and Alec suggests that some form of life is controlling the events. The two go out for food and pass by three women who have their umbrellas tangled up together. One of the women turns out to be Molly, who says she returned after her mother had been receiving constant calls from Alec's phone with no one on the other end. They go back to the apartment and discuss the matter, as the telephone repairman arrives. After, the three go to a restaurant, and face more inconveniences, such as having salt in their drink instead of sugar.

In a fit of rage, one of the men hits the deck of cards that Nat is holding, causing them to be tossed to the floor. In another strange coincidence, half of the cards land face down but all the face-up cards are red. The group of men leave in confusion and Alec invites Nat into his apartment for a drink to cool down. \n\nAfter consuming most of the club soda, the two men leave to grab more club soda in a nearby deli. At the deli, another strange incident occurs. The 3 glasses of club soda fall through a thin plastic bag, 5 feet towards the ground and do not break when they should have broken due to the fall. The storekeeper is shocked but Alec shrugs off the weird incident. Nat and Alec return to his apartment where he notices more strange coincidences. Alec grows frustrated and decides to call his friend McGill to help him make sense of everything. McGill promptly comes over to Alec’s apartment to help. McGill gets to the apartment and Alec tries to explain all of the coincidences. McGill is understandably very skeptical and wants Alec to prove it for his own eyes. \n\nAlec is able to prove that something strange his happening with a demonstration that involves throwing coins to the floor. The coins are thrown and somehow clustered together into a perfectly stacked pile. McGill then begins to believe Alec. He is uncertain about the probability of the coincidences but refuses to attribute it to superstitious happenings and states that it is an unknown force. When the two leave to go get food, they see and meet up with Molly on the street and quickly return to the apartment to catch Molly up on the strange occurrences. After much discussion over what could be causing the day’s incidents, they decide to all go to get food. They order drinks at the restaurant, but mysteriously the shaker is causing the liquids to freeze. Molly notes how the restaurant is continuously becoming warmer, and later Alec mentally notes that he can no longer hear the sound of the air conditioner. While preparing to discuss the issue of the AC, Alec accidentally flips his cigarette onto another occupied table. This causes a heated argument with the other guests and the unapproving look from the owner of the restaurant towards Alec. \n"}, {"worker_id": "105", "uid": "f9d835c77c914ddb9bc0cfca22c1947d", "response_text": "Alec, the narrator, had a very weird and exhausting day. In the morning he overslept work and hurried out. A rain storm started the subway was delayed and there was a huge excavation on his way. The drill working with clay hit something glittering inside and a little explosion happened. The narrator's face was slightly scratched and bleeding. His absence at the conference wasn't noticed. Back home Alec saw his wife's nots with directions all around as she left to attend to her mother. Then he tried to write his novel and came to a dead end, so he poured himself a drink and watched some pigeons being trained outside, when some traffic occurred and a couple birds fell. There were loud voices outside: four men confronted the narrator's neighbor, a shy guy named Nat. Then the man came in for a drink, and told Alec that he had miraculously won in cards a couple times in a row, and his partners believed he had cheated. The narrator and Nat went out for sodas in glass bottles, which fell and miraculously did not break. On the street, a pedestrian, who suddenly stopped in front of Nat, caused a series of accidents leading to a huge traffic jam. Back at Alec's place, the curtain was weirdly tied in three knots and he called his knowledgeable friend McGill to get a consultation. The man came and considered all of the day's weird events very improbable but not impossible. McGill offered to make a demonstration, so Alec threw a handful of coins which bounced together, stacking into a neat pile. McGill's coins created an exactly straight line. McGill stated that Alec was the center of the weird events and there must be some design in that. They went out to eat and the cars were wrecking all along their way, overwhelming the cops. Two people were unable to go past each other, they fought making the same motions and saying identical words. Many similar situations were happening all around. One of the women with intertwined umbrellas was Molly, the wife. Her mother's number was constantly dialed with no one on the line, and Alec's number was always busy, so Molly got worried. At that point Danny, the local policeman, started suspecting Alec. The three went out for dinner eventually and took Nat with them, who wanted to hear the story. Alec dropped his cigarettes out of the pack under the suspicious gaze of Danny and a lieutenant. In the restaurant the whole company got salty drinks which puzzled the bartender. When he tried to do the new ones, nothing came out of the shaker - everything inside turned into ice. The place suddenly started getting warmer and quieter. Alec's hand collided with Molly's and her cigarette fell into the dish of a perturbed lady at the nearby table. While standing up, Alec accidentally pulled everything from that table to the floor and the angry lady slapped him.

But he was forgetting one tiny thing—like calls to like.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n Peter Karson was dead. He had been dead for some time now, but the dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face, trickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop, from his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at a queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow where his eyes had been.\n \n  There was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the blood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great banks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would never come to life again.\n \n  I rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as before: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not changed, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold and alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like the machinery, and like Peter.\n \n  It was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what Peter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic, either. It was just an emptiness—a void that could not be filled by eating or drinking.\n \n  It was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise than they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for reason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it.\n \n  But the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore. For the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could not solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within me, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly—something moved on the skin of my cheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly.\n \n  A tear was trickling down my cheek.\n \n \n \n\n \n Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with satisfaction. His dream was perfect; the Citadel was complete, every minutest detail provided for—on paper. In two weeks they would be laying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow, glittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay finished, a living thing.\n \n Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining ship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home. In his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second satellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its insatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of laboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the meteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the stern—all the children of his brain.\n \n Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of atmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be a laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with the sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant ether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n \n A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious of the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still, that thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly, as if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his back.\n \n There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring impassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a face, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was blood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled body.\n \n For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging eyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved slowly away and was gone.\n \n \"Lord!\" he said.\n \n He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street somewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a moment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything was normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the world had grown suddenly unreal.\n \n One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding from the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the other part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition. It considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and decided that this was probable.\n \n Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands were shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the newsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n \n There were flaring red headlines.\n \n Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified, of course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be glad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more terrible illusion.\n \n \n INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON. 200 DEAD\n \n Then lines of type, and farther down:\n \n \n 50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n \n He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\n \n \n MOON SHIP DESTROYED IN TRANSIT NO COMMUNICATION FROM ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\n \n The item below the last one said:\n \n Pacifica, June 7—The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time in fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by R. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n \n \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized peoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their depredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized London; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state and in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed reports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends have not seen them.\n \n \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that we face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy superior to ourselves in every way .\n \n \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours ago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or in any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They have treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might have treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not attacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications, nor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they have done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us, driven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is more intolerable than any normal invasion.\n \n \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this challenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives are threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy the Invaders!\"\n \n Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the first time.\n \n \" Will we?\" he asked himself softly.\n \n \n\n \n It was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's laboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to a halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door mechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk. He mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent in the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened far enough to admit him.\n \n Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease on her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One blonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n \n \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger. Then she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n \n He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n \n She frowned. \"Why, no—Harry and I have been working for thirty-six hours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n \n \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n \n She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete, you know I haven't one—it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether there's trouble or not. What—\"\n \n \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n \n \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete—\"\n \n \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n \n She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then walked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of papers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\" and pressed the stud.\n \n A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and suddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n \n Lorelei caught her breath.\n \n It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by the warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the transport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have been dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there, yes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They disappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a heartbeat they were gone.\n \n There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow defiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of flesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those men and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly joined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of helpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more horrible than any cry of agony.\n \n \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a strangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the streets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\n \n \n\n \n Lorelei buried her head on his chest, clutching at him desperately.\n\"Peter!\" she said faintly. \"Why do they broadcast such things?\"\n \n \"They have to,\" he told her grimly. \"There will be panics and suicides, and they know it; but they have to do it. This isn't like a war, where the noncombatants' morale has to be kept up. There aren't going to be any noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about them, so that he can fight them—and then it may not be enough.\"\n \n The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared away from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached out to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles tense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating up the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the rest.\n \n \"That's the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ... forty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted. Then they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone through the solid wall, or simply melted away.\n \n The man and woman clung together, waiting.\n \n There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and other faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man screamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty gurgle and died, leaving silence again.\n \n Peter's lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms were jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away from him and started toward the inner room.\n \n \"Wait here,\" he mouthed.\n \n She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don't go in there! Peter! \" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward.\n \n There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been cleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down the narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal cages, and paused just short of it.\n \n The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the distorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his range of vision.\n \n \n\n \n Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin, Lorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the broad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His glazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness straight ahead of him.\n \n The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin. In a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood, paralyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\n \n The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were relaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread legs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull grew gradually flatter.\n \n When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless puddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\n \n There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond fear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said in a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\n \n The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move, but there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.\n \n The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\n \n \" Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami.... \"\n \n The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The ears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips seemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There were lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only the eyes were alive.\n \n \" ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom.... \"\n \n \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\n \n \" ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous. \"\n \n He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first time he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there, swaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled slowly....\n \n \" Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre. \"\n \n His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't—Go back!\" The horrible, mindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress. His insides writhed to thrust it out.\n \n She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the floor.\n \n The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold it back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his fingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in the room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\n \n \n\n \n Somebody said, \"Doctor!\"\n \n He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei—\" but his mouth only twitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly.\n \n He tried again. \"Doctor.\"\n \n \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice.\n \n He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him; in a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted oddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean, starched odor.\n \n \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand pressed him back into the sheets.\n \n \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\n \n He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\"\n \n \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been a very sick man.\"\n \n Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked around him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\n \n \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\n \n The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He turned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n \n Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal stand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of milky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n \n In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just before he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't—fool me. It's been more —than three—months.\"\n \n He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he kept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it out of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd been in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much sooner.\n \n \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\n\"Seeing that assistant of hers—it was enough to knock anybody out, especially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with them for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know—you talked a lot. It's a miracle you're alive, and rational.\"\n \n \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why I haven't been able to see her.\"\n \n Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to take it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children, and a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go, as soon as you're well enough to be moved. We started digging in six months ago.\"\n \n \"But why?\" Peter whispered.\n \n Arnold's strong jaw knotted. \"We're hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else has failed.\"\n \n Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went on after a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms. It didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't even take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was when a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at one time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It didn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'd been annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's still smoldering.\"\n \n \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily.\n \n \"Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be an impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated areas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavate enough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the other three-quarters will be dead, or worse.\"\n \n \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\"\n \n Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You've got to be. You're part of our last hope, you see.\"\n \n \"Our last hope?\"\n \n \"Yes. You're a scientist.\"\n \n \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the Citadel . No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but, maybe , he thought, there's a chance ....\n \n \n\n \n It wasn't very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It lay there in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more than five hundred meters in diameter, where the Citadel was to have been a thousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving into the hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled with the latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead, there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough to last a lifetime.\n \n It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there was one other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solid meters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmic rays, were gone.\n \n A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, to the left of the airlock— The Avenger . He stepped away now, and joined the group a little distance away, silently waiting.\n \n Lorelei said, \"You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter—\"\n \n \"Darling,\" he began wearily.\n \n \"Don't throw your life away! Give us time—there must be another way.\"\n \n \"There's no other way,\" Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as if he could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.\n\"Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground, but that's only delaying the end. They still come down here, only not as many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birth rate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures: we're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.\n \n \"They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're a million years too far back even to understand what they are or where they came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.\"\n \n She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook her slender body. But he went remorselessly on.\n \n \"Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. They make tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes, or a dozen ears—or a better brain. Out of those millions of possible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. We can't fight them , but a superman could. That's our only chance. Lorelei—darling—don't you see that?\"\n \n She choked, \"But why can't you take me along?\"\n \n He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. \"You know why,\" he said bitterly. \"Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos; they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven of staying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful. I couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die, too. You'd be their murderer.\"\n \n Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he no longer had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone out of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You'll come back, Peter.\"\n \n He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. A line from an old film kept echoing through his head. \" They'll come back—but not as boys !\"\n \n We'll come back, but not as men.\n \n We'll come back, but not as elephants.\n \n We'll come back, but not as octopi.\n \n \n\n \n He was trembling violently. He ran the last few steps, stumbled into the airlock, and pressed the stud that would seal the door behind him. We'll come back.... He heard the massive disk sink home, closing him off. Then he sank down on the floor of the airlock and put his head in shaking hands.\n \n After a while he roused himself, closed the inner door of the lock behind him, and walked down the long corridor into the control chamber. The shining banks of keys were there, waiting for his touch; he slumped down before them and listlessly closed the contact of the visiplate.\n \n He swung its field slowly, scanning for the last time the bare walls of the underground chamber, making sure that all the spectators had retired out of the way of the blast. Then his clawed fingers poised over the keys, hovered a moment, and thrust down.\n \n Acceleration pressed him deep into his chair. In the visiplate, the heavy doors that closed the tunnel above him flashed back, one by one. The energy-charged screen flickered off to let him pass, and closed smoothly behind him. The last doors, cleverly camouflaged, slipped back into place and then dwindled in the distance. It was done.\n \n He flashed on out, past the moon, past Mars, over the asteroid belt. The days merged into weeks, then months, and finally, far out, The Avenger curved into an orbit and held it. The great motors died, and the silence pressed in about him.\n \n Already he could feel the invisible rays burning resistlessly through his flesh as if it were water, shifting the cells of his body, working its slow, monstrous alchemy upon him. Peter waited until the changes were unmistakably evident in his skin and hair, and then he smashed all the mirrors in the ship.\n \n The embryos were pulsing with unnatural life, even in the suspended animation of their crystal cells. One by one he allowed them to mature, and after weeks or years destroyed the monstrosities that came from the incubators. Time went by, meaninglessly. He ate when he was hungry, slept when his driving purpose let him, and worked unceasingly, searching for the million-to-one chance.\n \n He stared sometimes through changed eyes at the tiny blue star that was Earth, wondering if the race he had left behind still burrowed in its worm-tunnels, digging deeper and deeper away from the sunlight. But after a time he ceased even to wonder.\n \n And one changeling-child he did not destroy. He fed knowledge to its eager brain, and watched it through the swift years, with a dawning hope....\n \n \n\n \n Peter closed the diary. \"The rest you know, Robert,\" he said.\n \n \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I was that child. I am the millionth mutation you were searching for.\"\n \n His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your brain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid's. You solve instinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours of work. You are a superman.\"\n \n \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms.\n \n He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he stood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but little in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled over his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of flesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had a tiny sixth finger on his left hand.\n \n He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once accidentally drawn one of my talons across his face.\n \n \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I've waited so long—keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from you, not telling you, even, about Earth until now—because I had to be sure. But now, the waiting is over.\n \n \"They're still there, I'm sure of it—the people, and the Invaders. You can kill the Invaders, Robert.\"\n \n He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive knowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we had a saying: 'Fight fire with fire.' That is the way it will be with you. You are completely, coldly logical, just as they are. You can understand them, and so you can conquer them.\"\n \n I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\"\n \n He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What—what did you say?\"\n \n I repeated it patiently.\n \n \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an instant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his suffering, but I could recognize it.\n \n \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just as the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the things which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are more nearly kin to me than your people.\"\n \n \n\n \n Peter's eyes were dull, his limbs slumped. For a moment I thought that the shock had deranged his mind.\n \n His voice trembled when he said, \"But if I ask you to kill them, and not my people?\"\n \n \"To do so would be illogical.\"\n \n He waved his hands helplessly. \"Gratitude?\" he muttered.\n \n \"No, you don't understand that, either.\"\n \n Then he cried suddenly, \"But I am your friend, Robert!\"\n \n \"I do not understand 'friend,'\" I said.\n \n I did understand \"gratitude,\" a little. It was a reciprocal arrangement: I did what Peter wished, so long as I did not actively want to do otherwise, because he had done things for me. Very well, then we must not go back. It was very simple, but I knew that he could not comprehend it.\n \n I tried to explain it to him, however. But he only stared at me, with an expression on his face that I had never seen there before, and that, somehow, I did not like to see. It was disquieting, and so I hastened to the end that I knew was inevitable.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "68b25a55ece94644acbc50b3905aa760", "response_text": "Peter Karson has finished planning out the blueprint for the Citadel.

He then shakingly lights a cigarette and turns on the newsbox to see that an invader has appeared in Boston. More disasters are listed below, and the World Police announces that the Invaders have already begun terrorizing the world since they appeared twenty-four hours ago. Peter is doubtful that they can take down the Invaders and goes to Lorelei Cooper’s laboratory. Lorelei does not know what is happening because Harry and she have been working for thirty-six hours straight. She does not have a newsbox, but he tells her to turn on her scanner to see the news. The panel shows the Science City of Manhattan, but the Invaders have come and snatched up men and women. Slowly, two Invaders make their way to the Atlas building, where Peter and Lorelei are. He goes into the inner room, even though she yells at him not to go. The Invaders have reduced Harry to nothing but a puddle of flesh, and Peter begins to ask why they are doing this desperately. They whisper to him in a strange language; he suddenly realizes that Lorelei has followed him. She drops to the floor after looking at the Invaders, which makes Peter scream. When he awakes again, a doctor named Arnold tells him to lie back down and that he is in a hospital. Although Dr. Arnold initially tells him that he has been in the hospital for three months, he eventually finds out that it has already been nine and a half months since he went into his coma. All of the survivors are underground because nobody knew how to kill the Invaders. Peter is considered their last hope because he is a scientist, and he thinks back to his plan of the Citadel. The ship is built, and it is called The Avenger instead. Lorelei tries to plead with Peter, but he refuses and says that it must be him who finds a superman that can destroy the Invaders. He goes into space until the ship curves into orbit. Peter kills many of the changeling children, but he allows one to live. The child is named Robert and is considered to be a super-intelligent being. Peter is hopeful that the changeling can kill the Invaders, but Robert says he will not return to Earth. He explains that they are like kin to him, and he logically has no reason to kill him. Peter is shocked and tries to plead with Robert, but the superman does not understand emotions.

The story moves to the past, when young Peter finished the project of 'Citadel' - a spaceship to set off to an orbit. 'Citadel' was supposed to be a huge well-equipped laboratory, the first of its kind. While imagining the greatness of the creation, Peter felt dread and saw a face staring at him outside the window, fifty stories up. The face was scary and inhuman, the body hung without support for a while and then disappeared. Everything around was normal and Peter was worried he had gone mad. Then he saw the red headlines in the newspapers about appearing invaders and disappearing people. Cities worldwide were attacked and the World Police were mobilizing. The news proclaimed that the greatest enemy was to be faced and defeated. Peter rushed downstairs to Lorelei's laboratory, who had been working without breaks and hadn't seen the news. After Peter's agonized pleas, Lorelei turned on the news and saw a video of people becoming an unrecognizable joined mass, helpless and suffering. Then the two saw their own building in the news and halted. Peter went towards the inner room despite Lorelei's protests. He saw two aliens staring at Harry, Lorelei's assistant, and turning him into a boneless mess. Peter was so shocked that he screamed \"why?\" and heard some incomprehensible whisper in his head in response. Suddenly, Peter saw that Lorelei had followed him and her body dropped to the floor. Peter screamed inhumanely loudly and faded. He woke up in a hospital, the doctor said he had been very sick for three months and that Lorelei was fine. When Peter kept asking, he finally learned that he had been in a coma for more than nine months because of the rather long contact he had had with the invaders. Lorelei was simply shocked and recovered much faster. Arnold, the doctor, finally decided that Peter was strong enough to learn the truth and told about the part of humanity hiding underground as killing the aliens turned out to be impossible. Peter was needed as a scientist. His 'Citadel' project contained everything necessary to live a lifetime, it was a new independent world to save the rest of humanity. So, it was renamed 'The Avenger' and finished, as life underground was not a solution but a delay. Lorelei was in despair because of Peter boarding the ship and wanted to follow, but the rays were strong and even Peter had low chances of staying alive. When 'The Avenger' reached orbit, Peter felt the rays burning his flesh and smashed the mirrors to allow the embryos to mature. After a long time Peter told the story to Robert, the mutation-child with a superior brain who could destroy the invaders. Robert refused to go to Earth as his brain was logical and saw no reasons to destroy the Invaders. Peter didn't understand and the inevitable end approached.

The narrator says that they do not regret doing so, but they are unable to explain their emotions as they feel a tear rolling down their cheek. The story then goes back to a younger Peter as he finishes his project, the development of the Citadel spaceship. He suddenly hears a strange whisper within his brain, and he turns around to see a face with a shriveled body staring at him through the window. The creature slowly dissolves and disappears, and Peter is left stunned. He finds breaking news of invasions all over the world, murdering hundreds of civilians. The invaders, according to Secretary of the Council, are from outer space, and the World Police is attempting to destroy them. Peter rushes downstairs to find Lorelei, his lover, in the laboratory. She is unaware of the news, and upon seeing footage of the gruesome attacks, she is shocked, and they soon see the invaders approaching their building from the television. Peter steps into another room, seeing the two creatures with their focus on Harry Kanin, Lorelei's assistant. To Peter's horror, Harry quickly becomes a limp pile of flesh. Peter confronts the creatures but only hears foreign whispers, as Lorelei drops to the floor behind him. Peter lets out a scream, and wakes up in a hospital. The doctor tells him that he has been there in a coma for over nine months, and that Lorelei had recovered from shock. The doctor then tells Peter that society has moved to living underground in order to avoid the invaders; Peter, as a scientist, is their last hope. Later, Peter approaches the newly crafted spaceship, titled The Avenger, which lacks the typical shield to protect one from cosmic rays. Lorelei begs Peter not to go, but he believes it is necessary, and too much of a risk for Lorelei to join him. He boards the ship with the mission to create a \"superman\" to ultimately defeat the invaders; the plan is to allow the cosmic rays to mutate several embryos on board, hopefully creating a strong enough being. As The Avenger leaves and goes into orbit, Peter begins feeling the effects of the rays as his skin and hair mutates. As time passes, he allows the embryos to develop, destroying all but one. He raises the embryo as it develops into a person, and the story jumps many years later, as the child becomes a man named Robert. Peter had raised Robert, with a superior brain and logical ability, to be the defeater of the invaders. Informing Robert of the plan to return back to Earth, Robert surprisingly refuses. Peter is taken aback, and Robert explains that he is not able to comprehend the emotions that would lead him to kill the invaders and save Earthmen.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n Except for transportation, it was absolutely free ... but how much would the freight cost?\n \n\n \n \"It is an outrage,\" said Koltan of the House of Masur, \"that the Earthmen land among the Thorabians!\"\n \n Zotul, youngest of the Masur brothers, stirred uneasily. Personally, he was in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\n \n At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his dotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the Pottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and he knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers—Koltan, eldest and Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their treasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in the rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\n \n \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are these Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength and our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may come and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the fame and fortune of the House of Masur.\"\n \n \"It is a damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's philosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in Lor.\"\n \n \"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran rather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\"\n \n By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen, which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting to get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a very scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.\n \n \n\n \n Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough for him. He would report when the time was ripe.\n \n \"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his elders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means of transport.\"\n \n Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret conclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it. The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.\n \n \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime, remember your position in the family.\"\n \n Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.\n \n \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of the clay.\"\n \n Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they did.\n \n Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought about the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way of metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could figure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of his brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of course, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.\n \n \n\n \n By and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange metal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the city, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of tile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the people to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much too quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to be desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident.\n \n The Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of Zur. It required but the cooperation—an excellent word, that—of all Zurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in effect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered, for it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a whaling for it.\n \n There was also some talk going around about agreements made between the Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one thing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a newspaper, was unknown on Zur.\n \n Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously, none had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had tried. The anti-Earthmen Faction—in any culture complex, there is always an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor—crowed happily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.\n \n Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships arrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was practically acrawl with Earthmen.\n \n Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called\n\"corporations\"—Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The object of the visit was trade.\n \n In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian city of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took some time for the news to spread.\n \n The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the pottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an aluminum pot at him.\n \n \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.\n \n \"A pot. I bought it at the market.\"\n \n \"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my substance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I say!\"\n \n \n\n \n The pretty young wife laughed at him. \"Up to your ears in clay, no wonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen are selling them everywhere. They're much better than our old clay pots; they're light and easy to handle and they don't break when dropped.\"\n \n \"What good is it?\" asked Zotul, interested. \"How will it hold heat, being so light?\"\n \n \"The Earthmen don't cook as we do,\" she explained patiently. \"There is a paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have to design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\"\n \n \"Don't be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new type of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do you need a whole new stove for one little pot?\"\n \n \"A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan will have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are buying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman said so.\"\n \n \"He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go back to cooking with your old ones.\"\n \n \"The Earthman took them in trade—one reason why the new ones are so cheap. There isn't a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you will have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use them.\"\n \n After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul stamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would accommodate the terrestrial pots very well.\n \n And Koltan put the model into production.\n \n \"Orders already are pouring in like mad,\" he said the next day. \"It was wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am sorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to do well by us.\"\n \n The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with the demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a million had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the hundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every land.\n \n \n\n \n In the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth. One was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever dreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of the Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines poured from it in a fantastic stream. The populace fervidly brushed up on its scanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by the novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book—a primer in the Lorian language—and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the brothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance.\n \n Moreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire—more than enough in value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur—and set up telegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent. Within five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major city on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed the instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph. And the business of the House of Masur continued to look up.\n \n \"As I have always said from the beginning,\" chortled Director Koltan,\n\"this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and especially for the House of Masur.\"\n \n \"You didn't think so at first,\" Zotul pointed out, and was immediately sorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his unthinkable impertinence.\n \n It would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their production of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per cent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves greatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but their business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from Earth.\n \n About this time, plastic utensils—dishes, cups, knives, forks—made their appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the newfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for everything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade. What they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They destroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.\n \n The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of Masur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth.\n \n \n\n \n Trembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan called an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his senile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man might still have a little wit left that could be helpful.\n \n \"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine our business,\" and he read off the figures.\n \n \"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before, and will result in something even better for us.\"\n \n Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly subsided.\n \n \"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior terrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that sells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their eyes, we can be ruined.\"\n \n The brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while Father Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got nowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.\n \n \"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom of your trouble, but the things of Earth. Think of the telegraph and the newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth. The merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these newspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are intrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to buy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you might also have advertisements of your own.\"\n \n Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising from the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the advertisements of the Earthmen.\n \n In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the brothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several things had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal rest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had procured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which they found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What they did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered in the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working under supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil regions to every major and minor city on Zur.\n \n \n\n \n By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first terrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in gas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business was gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas at a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the brothers Masur.\n \n The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an energetic protest to the governor of Lor.\n \n At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen for a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and departed from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of Masur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that much new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\n \n \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan blackly.\n \n In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was loaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other radio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the natural follow-up in its campaign of advertising—radio programs—with commercials.\n \n Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\n \n \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not paused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be modern—keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing all in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a great, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in ten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they are even bringing autos to Zur!\"\n \n The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these hitherto unheard-of vehicles.\n \n \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the Earthmen are taking care of that.\"\n \n At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves that they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses and street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new highways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made yet.\n \n \n\n \n Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people bought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways were constructed.\n \n The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants and began to manufacture Portland cement.\n \n You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of course, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either tile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff made far better road surfacing.\n \n The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.\n \n The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot handle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising Council.\"\n \n \"What is that?\" asked Koltan.\n \n \"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as yours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain in the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with it. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\"\n \n The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to Zotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling him in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.\n \n All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the purpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they had to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.\n \n Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated on their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not surprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to make room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved with something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering new automobiles.\n \n An automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now that they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached with desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and they were the envied ones of Zur.\n \n Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands jovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a better look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual with genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in the baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for an indefinite sense of alienness about him.\n \n \"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping Zotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you straightened out in no time.\"\n \n \n\n \n All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this occasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.\n \n Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been made upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\n \n \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in the world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab Masur—Divinity protect him—departed this life to collect his greater reward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and bones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone is the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and all because of new things coming from Earth.\"\n \n Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come to me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has, we're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth—always to do right by the customer.\"\n \n \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for damages.\"\n \n Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense fortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your trouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do you own an automobile?\"\n \n \"No.\"\n \n \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"\n \n Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes the music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"\n \n Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the bargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.\n \n \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these luxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off with a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car from the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered and installed in your home.\"\n \n \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"\n \n \"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to you absolutely free—a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is that you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to make profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the Galaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out the full program takes time.\"\n \n He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our extremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise, but sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the motto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\"\n \n \n\n \n The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it was no more than fair to pay transportation.\n \n He said, \"How much does the freight cost?\"\n \n Broderick told him.\n \n \"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is sixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the merchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering the cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\"\n \n \"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together have so much money any more.\"\n \n \"You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you credit!\"\n \n \"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically.\n \n \"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the rich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the involutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that might have had a discouraging effect.\n \n On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting. Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do to get credit?\"\n \n \"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our Easy Payment Plan.\"\n \n Zotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for myself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\"\n \n \"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each of your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is all there is to it.\"\n \n It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul wrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.\n \n \"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will have the figures.\"\n \n The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul pointed this out politely.\n \n \"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all, you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be paid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight. This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\"\n \n \"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our plant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.\"\n \n \"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You will start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain parts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local manufacture to help bring prices down.\"\n \n \"We haven't the equipment.\"\n \n \"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only a quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial company.\"\n \n \n\n \n Zotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman, won over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter interest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth. These, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.\n \n The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the Earthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.\n \n For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the new concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a terrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from the crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit. The food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges, served up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the winter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though they had gas-fired central heating.\n \n About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric generators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of electrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason, batteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to buy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?\n \n The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan. They had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric fans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could possibly sell them.\n \n \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but meantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\"\n \n But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option. The Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The Earthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because it was so much more efficient—and to lower prices, which was Earth's unswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded. Broderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.\n \n The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets were delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and maintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth had them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth, but to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.\n \n The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush business.\n \n \n\n \n For the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade and a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this backward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was slow, but it was extremely sure.\n \n The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less money and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television kept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the pangs of impoverishment.\n \n The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul designed and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons were a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold them for less.\n \n The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any more, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.\n \n \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with fists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some contracts to continue operating.\"\n \n Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr. Broderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him. Would he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.\n \n Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint of toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.\n \n \"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He looked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of making it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"\n \n \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul.\n \n \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything attached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are attached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that—yet. We will only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your pottery to us.\"\n \n The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of beating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was somewhat comforted.\n \n \"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the governor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of Masur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is time for the government to do something for us.\"\n \n \n\n \n The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of confusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men covetous and Zurian women envious.\n \n \"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting you.\"\n \n \"Me?\" marveled Zotul.\n \n She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor of Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a friendly smile.\n \n \"Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.\"\n \n Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick, the Earthman.\n \n \"I—I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion.\n \n Broderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted with your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\"\n \n \"I don't understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are about to lose our plant.\"\n \n \"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away from you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and richest on Zur, it has taken a long time—the longest of all, in fact.\"\n \n \"What do you mean?\"\n \n \"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have bought you out.\"\n \n \"Our government....\"\n \n \"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could not pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took them over, just as we are taking you over.\"\n \n \"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything on Zur?\"\n \n \"Even your armies.\"\n \n \"But why ?\"\n \n \n\n \n Broderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared down moodily into the street.\n \n \"You don't know what an overcrowded world is like,\" he said. \"A street like this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossible on Earth.\"\n \n \"But it's mobbed,\" protested Zotul. \"It gave me a headache.\"\n \n \"And to us it's almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth has made us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only habitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least populous worlds and—well, buy them out and move in.\"\n \n \"And after that?\"\n \n Broderick smiled gently. \"Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry with yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians nor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.\"\n \n Zotul sat in silent thought. \"But you did not have to buy us out. You had the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could have been yours alone.\" He stopped in alarm. \"Or am I suggesting an idea that didn't occur to you?\"\n \n \"No,\" said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with memory. \"We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method causes more distress than we like to inflict, but it's better—and more sure—than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is finished, we can repair the dislocations.\"\n \n \"At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.\"\n \n \"Slow but sure.\" Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the shoulder. \"Don't worry. You'll have your job back, the same as always, but you'll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur are equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That's why we had to break down your caste system.\"\n \n Zotul's eyes widened. \"And that is why my brothers did not beat me when I failed!\"\n \n \"Of course. Are you ready now to take the assignment papers for you and your brothers to sign?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" said Zotul. \"I am ready.\"", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "101", "uid": "85ccc303499c42b4bb9cdcbb2e525a3c", "response_text": "The House of Masur is a family business in Zur, run by Koltan and his six sons. The business specializes in pottery and clay manufacturing for Zur. The family gathers as they deliberate the upcoming arrival of Earthmen. Some of the brothers express frustration that the Earthmen will be landing among the Thorabians rather than in Zur, disrupting their plan to steal the precious, scarce metals off their ship. Zotul, the youngest of the brothers, discourages the plan, saying that the Earthmen's ship is their only way of transport. After the meeting, Zotul ponders what other benefits the Earthmen could serve. The Earthmen eventually arrive at Zur, parading the streets and making speeches, and leaving shortly after. They return with multiple ships and establish corporations all over Zur. One day, Zotul's wife brings home a metal pot, which she had bought from Earthmen; she tells him that they are high in demand and that a new type of stove is essential to use them. Zotul protests, but later designs a ceramic stove, which becomes a successful development in their business. Earthmen continue introducing more technology to Zur, including a printing press and telegraphs. Zotul notes internally that though the business has made profit, it is dependent upon the pots from Earth. The business quickly begins declining, with sales dropping. They attempt to advertise their business, but advertisement has become fully occupied by Earth. After ten years, during which Koltan has passed on, the Masur business has dwindled. The brothers decide to go to the governor of Lor, who tells them that the developments are all beneficial, informing them of a new production of highways. The brothers are optimistic that they would be able to use their clay for the roads, but Earthmen begin using cement. The governor then refers the brothers to Earth's Merchandising Council, where Zotul meets Kent Broderick, where he expresses sympathy about the status of the Masur business and offers them the luxuries brought by Earthmen, completely free except for the cost of freight. The cost, however, is more than the brothers could ever afford, and so Broderick sets them up with a credit system, as well as a contract for the family to supply Earthmen with ceramic parts. The brothers enjoy their luxury, but it is short lived, as their contract expires and they find themselves in debt. Zotul then revisits the governor, who ends up being Broderick. Broderick informs Zotul that Earth has bought them, and every business in Zur, out, and that they own everything. Broderick tells Zotul that the family will work for Earth now, and that Earth will fully conquer Zur.

Soon, more Earthmen arrive on the planet. They land a ship in every city on Zur and begin trading basic items. When they trade, they take the Zurian version of their goods and destroy them. Zotul is forced to design new stoves for the new cookware. Zotul and his brothers are initially able to make a great profit selling their new ceramic stoves. \n\nThe Earthmen continue to bring new inventions that the Zurian population do not possess. They bring new communication devices like the printing press, then radios, and eventually television sets. Eventually, Zotul and his brother’s operations are unable to compete with the Earthmen’s goods. Their profits drop to abysmal levels in all of their industries. Zotul is told by his brothers to go make a formal complaint. He goes to the headquarters of the Merchandising Council where he meets Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council. Broderick acts very nice to Zotul and appears to only have good intentions. Broderick promises to help Zotul and offers to give him many luxurious gifts that Zotul states he cannot afford. Broderick explains to Zotul that is of no issue and he can offer him credit. After only explaining the good parts of credit to Zotul, Zotul goes and convinces his brothers to sign up for the credit system. In addition, Broderick gives them a contract to manufacture some goods for the Earthmen. However, the contract does not last long and the Earthmen build their own plant. As a result, the House of Masur is unable to keep up with its debts. Zotul’s brothers express their anger and accuse Zotul of getting them into incredible poverty. In an effort to remedy the situation, Zotul goes to the Council House where he does not find Mr. Broderick but a man named Mr. Siwicki. Mr. Siwicki informs him that the Earthmen will repossess everything him and his brothers own if they do not pay their debts. Zotul’s brothers are so stunned by the news that they do not even beat him. In a last-ditch effort, Zotul goes to the governor’s palace for help. There he finds Broderick is now the governor. Broderick then informs Zotul that the Earthmen were slowly taking ownership of Zur away from the Zurian to then move in an attempt to peacefully take over the planet. The ultimate goal is to mix with the native population and then form a cohesive one. However, the Zurian caste system had to be first broken down.

Morvan thinks that the Earthmen could have come to Lor, and Singula implies that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen. Zotul tries to explain that they cannot take the Earthmen’s method of transport away from them, but the other brothers tell him to be quiet. The Earthmen arrive at Lor and are impressed with the city, and they communicate through interpreters. Some agreements between the Lorian government and the Earthmen are made. Although the anti-Earthmen Faction is happy that the Earthmen are gone, the visitors come back and establish corporations to engage in trade. When Zotul comes home, his wife Lania shows him an aluminum pot. She tells him that the Earthmen are selling these items cheap. She tells him that he will need to design a new ceramic stove for a dozen pots. He beats his wife but goes off to design the stove anyways; the Masurs begin to profit more than ever from the porcelain stoves. The Earthmen also bring other items such as the printing press, copper wire for telegraph lines, and plastic cutlery. The Masur family ceramics are slowly being replaced. Kalrab concludes that the items from Earth are the main reason.  The Earthmen begin to lay pipelines after the discovery of crude oil and natural gas. The Masur stove business is also gone after ten years; the brothers plan to protest to the governor of Lor. They see the Earthmen are building more structures, such as an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The brothers want to rely on their tile business, but the Earthmen have begun manufacturing Portland cement.

The Earthmen parade through Zur, proclaiming the intention to do great things and asking for cooperation. After a while, many more ships come from Earth to every Zurian city to establish \"corporations\" for trade. Zotul's wife buys a set of cheap aluminum pots at the market, which are being bought by all the housewives as they are better than those from clay. New pots require completely different stoves and Zotul has to design such. Koltan, the elder brother, puts the model into production as the demand is high. The Masurs flourish with the new business and depend on the metal pots from Earth, as the production of their own falls. The Earthmen keep introducing new things like telegraph lines and printing presses. The Earthmen find a great deal of metals, crude oil and natural gas, and sell it to the Zurians themselves. Further introduction of plastic utensils undermines the Masur's business completely. They head to the governor, who talks about the benefits of new culture and upcoming autos and highways. The Earthmen introduce cement and the hopes for tile business go down as well. The complaints are redirected to the Merchandising Council set by the Earthmen, where Zotul is met by Broderick. The man is sympathetic to the brothers’ poverty, but he can only grant Zotul a gas range, a gas-fired furnace and a car, a luxury only a few can afford and everyone envies. The goal of the Earthmen is to spread technology through the galaxy, so Broderick only asks Zotul to pay for the freight, which is a huge sum, and, therefore, can only be in credit for the family.

As the time goes by, the Earthmen bring in more expensive and advanced technologies like autos, TVs, radios. People become dependent on those technologies, and as they break, they need to buy the new ones, everyone dreams of luxury cars, etc. At the same time the local businesses fail and poverty approaches. To be able to buy the new technologies, the Zurians get credits and work for the Earthmen to pay them off. Then the contracts are cancelled and the people have to sell their businesses. Therefore, the Earthmen gain control over the whole planet.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n I admit it: I didn't know if I was coming or going—but I know that if I stuck to the old man, I was a comer ... even if he was a goner!\n \n\n \n Doc had this solemn human by the throat when I caught up with him.\n \n \"Tonight,\" Doc was saying in his old voice that was as crackled and important as parchment, \"tonight Man will reach the Moon. The golden Moon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night when this is to happen.\"\n \n \"Sure,\" the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc's arthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. \"No argument. Sure, up we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in the teeth!\"\n \n I came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose, one finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned that during all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled, but I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winos in Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have been wanted for the murder of a North American Mountie.\n \n It was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame, layered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side. One of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of the greasy collar of the human.\n \n \"I hope you'll forgive him, sir,\" I said, not meeting the man's eyes.\n\"He's my father and very old, as you can see.\" I laughed inside at the absurd, easy lie. \"Old events seem recent to him.\"\n \n The human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight.\n\"'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. But Great-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl. Sharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?\"\n \n I told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse three doors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happen if we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, for all I knew.\n \n \n\n \n Martians approaching the corner were sensing at Doc and me. They were just cheap tourists slumming down on Skid Row. I hated tourists and especially I hated Martian tourists because I especially hated Martians. They were aliens . They weren't men like Doc and me.\n \n Then I realized what was about to happen. It was foolish and awful and true. I was going to have one of mine at the same time Doc was having his. That was bad. It had happened a few times right after I first found him, but now it was worse. For some undefinable reason, I felt we kept getting closer each of the times.\n \n I tried not to think about it and helped Doc through the fly-specked flophouse doors.\n \n The tubercular clerk looked up from the gaudy comics sections of one of those little tabloids that have the funnies a week in advance.\n \n \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he said mechanically.\n \n \"We'll use one bed,\" I told him. \"I'll give you twenty cents.\" I felt the round hard quarter in my pocket, sweaty hand against sticky lining.\n \n \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he played it back for me.\n \n Doc was quivering against me, his legs boneless.\n \n \"We can always make it over to the mission,\" I lied.\n \n The clerk turned his upper lip as if he were going to spit. \"Awright, since we ain't full up. In ad vance.\"\n \n I placed the quarter on the desk.\n \n \"Give me a nickel.\"\n \n The clerk's hand fell on the coin and slid it off into the unknown before I could move, what with holding up Doc.\n \n \"You've got your nerve,\" he said at me with a fine mist of dew. \"Had a quarter all along and yet you Martian me down to twenty cents.\" He saw the look on my face. \"I'll give you a room for the two bits. That's better'n a bed for twenty.\"\n \n I knew I was going to need that nickel. Desperately. I reached across the desk with my free hand and hauled the scrawny human up against the register hard. I'm not as strong in my hands as Doc, but I managed.\n \n \"Give me a nickel,\" I said.\n \n \"What nickel?\" His eyes were big, but they kept looking right at me.\n\"You don't have any nickel. You don't have any quarter, not if I say so. Want I should call a cop and tell him you were flexing a muscle?\"\n \n I let go of him. He didn't scare me, but Doc was beginning to mumble and that did scare me. I had to get him alone.\n \n \"Where's the room?\" I asked.\n \n \n\n \n The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet high. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino singing on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't have any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.\n \n I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face to shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the bedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.\n \n Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning eyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so dirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy scalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's gas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed to shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I didn't need to.\n \n The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered, uncovered floor.\n \n It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a jagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it an unreal distortion.\n \n Doc began to mumble louder.\n \n I knew I had to move.\n \n I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I moved.\n \n I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found my notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both my mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I concentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their habit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were suddenly distinguishable.\n \n \n\n \n \" Outsider ... Thoth ... Dyzan ... Seven ... Hsan ... Beyond Six, Seven, Eight ... Two boxes ... Ralston ... Richard Wentworth ... Jimmy Christopher ... Kent Allard ... Ayem ... Oh, are ... see ....\"\n \n \n\n \n His voice rose to a meaningless wail that stretched into non-existence. The pen slid across the scribbled face of the notebook and both dropped from my numb hands. But I knew. Somehow, inside me, I knew that these words were what I had been waiting for. They told everything I needed to know to become the most powerful man in the Solar Federation.\n \n That wasn't just an addict's dream. I knew who Doc was. When I got to thinking it was just a dream and that I was dragging this old man around North America for nothing, I remembered who he was.\n \n I remembered that he was somebody very important whose name and work I had once known, even if now I knew him only as Doc.\n \n Pain was a pendulum within me, swinging from low throbbing bass to high screaming tenor. I had to get out and get some. But I didn't have a nickel. Still, I had to get some.\n \n I crawled to the door and raised myself by the knob, slick with greasy dirt. The door opened and shut—there was no lock. I shouldn't leave Doc alone, but I had to.\n \n He was starting to cry. He didn't always do that.\n \n I listened to him for a moment, then tested and tasted the craving that crawled through my veins. I got back inside somehow.\n \n Doc was twisting on the cot, tears washing white streaks across his face. I shoved Doc's face up against my chest. I held onto him and let him bellow. I soothed the lanks of soiled white hair back over his lumpy skull.\n \n He shut up at last and I laid him down again and put his arm back across his face. (You can't turn the light off and on in places like that. The old wiring will blow the bulb half the time.)\n \n I don't remember how I got out onto the street.\n \n \n\n \n She was pink and clean and her platinum hair was pulled straight back, drawing her cheek-bones tighter, straightening her wide, appealing mouth, drawing her lean, athletic, feminine body erect. She was wearing a powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the upper half of her legs.\n \n The most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it wasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that. It was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin.\n \n I went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody would help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they think you are blotto.\n \n \"Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?\" I kept my eyes down. I couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. \"Just a dime for a cup of coffee.\" I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two and a half.\n \n I felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used, perhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. \"Do you want it for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?\"\n \n I cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized that anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate tourists.\n \n \"Just coffee, ma'am.\" She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to call her that. \"A little more for food, if you could spare it.\"\n \n I hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much.\n \n \"I'll buy you a dinner,\" she said carefully, \"provided I can go with you and see for myself that you actually eat it.\"\n \n I felt my face flushing red. \"You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum like me, ma'am.\"\n \n \"I'll be seen with you if you really want to eat.\"\n \n It was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice whatever.\n \n \"Okay,\" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.\n \n \n\n \n The coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was pale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands to feel its warmth.\n \n Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool beside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but there she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible tourist .\n \n I gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could do. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and was able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt—good. Not abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of exhilaration.\n \n That was what coffee did for me.\n \n I was a caffeine addict.\n \n Earth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but I knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected my metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the same, but the need ran as deep.\n \n I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure sensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the price of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles with a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in them—not enough, never enough, but better than nothing.\n \n \"Now what do you want to eat?\" the woman asked.\n \n I didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human—an Earth human. I was a man , of course, not an alien like a Martian. Earthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an Earthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That proved it, didn't it?\n \n \"Hamburger,\" I said. \"Well done.\" I knew that would probably be all they had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but then I didn't have the local prejudices.\n \n I didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how clean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so dirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every hour for the rest of my life.\n \n The hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails and raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba, almost in a single movement of my jaws.\n \n Several other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a glass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting for me.\n \n \"Could I have a few to take with me, miss?\" I pleaded.\n \n She smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I just felt it.\n \n \"That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',\" she said. \"I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.\"\n \n That probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. \"No, miss,\" I said.\n \n \"It's Miss Casey—Vivian Casey,\" she corrected. She was a schoolteacher, all right. No other girl would introduce herself as Miss Last Name. Then there was something in her voice....\n \n \"What's your name?\" she said to me.\n \n I choked a little on a bite of stale bun.\n \n I had a name, of course .\n \n \n\n \n Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and thought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the girl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that was my name.\n \n \"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"\n \n \"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like waterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help me .\"\n \n \"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.\n \n She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.\n\"What do you think of this?\"\n \n I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.\n  Dear Acolyte R. I. S. :\n  Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, \"The Scarlet Book\" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the Universe.\n \n  Name : ........................\n  Address : .....................\n \n The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner and Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.\n \n There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was trying to pull it out.\n \n I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a cup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and a pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five—if the lady didn't pay you.\"\n \n \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that bill out of your hand?\"\n \n I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman put down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant bar, smoothing it.\n \n I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the sidewalk, only in the doorways.\n \n \n\n \n First I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon light was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window somewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and the one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had changed around—prayer came from the left, song from the right.\n \n Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a thing .\n \n \n\n \n My heart hammered at my lungs. I knew this last time had been different. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time Doc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a start.\n \n He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom. His strong hands had unraveled some of the bed \"springs\"—metal webbing—and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had dissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a meaningful whole.\n \n I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I became lost.\n \n I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of hamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any hungry rats out of the walls.\n \n I knelt beside Doc.\n \n \"An order, my boy, an order,\" he whispered.\n \n I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?\n \n He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen, before dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook against the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.\n \n \"Concentrate,\" Doc said hoarsely. \"Concentrate....\"\n \n I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of concentration.\n \n The words \"First Edition\" were what I was thinking about most.\n \n \n\n \n The heavy-set man in the ornate armchair was saying, \"The bullet struck me as I was pulling on my boot....\"\n \n I was kneeling on the floor of a Victorian living room. I'm quite familiar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately.\n \n Then I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these months—time travel.\n \n A thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled dressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and whitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird! If there was anything I hated or held in more contempt than tourists or Martians, it was a snowbird.\n \n \"My clients have occasioned singular methods of entry into these rooms,\" the thin man remarked, \"but never before have they used instantaneous materialization.\"\n \n The heavier man was half choking, half laughing. \"I say—I say, I would like to see you explain this, my dear fellow.\"\n \n \"I have no data,\" the thin man answered coolly. \"In such instance, one begins to twist theories into fact, or facts into theories. I must ask this unemployed, former professional man who has gone through a serious illness and is suffering a more serious addiction to tell me the place and time from which he comes.\"\n \n The surprise stung. \"How did you know?\" I asked.\n \n He gestured with a pale hand. \"To maintain a logical approach, I must reject the supernatural. Your arrival, unless hallucinatory—and despite my voluntary use of one drug and my involuntary experiences recently with another, I must accept the evidence of my senses or retire from my profession—your arrival was then super-normal. I might say super-scientific, of a science not of my or the good doctor's time, clearly. Time travel is a familiar folk legend and I have been reading an article by the entertaining Mr. Wells. Perhaps he will expand it into one of his novels of scientific romance.\"\n \n I knew who these two men were, with a tormenting doubt. \"But the other—\"\n \n \"Your hands, though unclean, have never seen physical labor. Your cranial construction is of a superior type, or even if you reject my theories, concentration does set the facial features. I judge you have suffered an illness because of the inhibition of your beard growth. Your over-fondness for rum or opium, perhaps, is self-evident. You are at too resilient an age to be so sunk by even an amour. Why else then would you let yourself fall into such an underfed and unsanitary state?\"\n \n \n\n \n He was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I couldn't trust to my own senses as he did.\n \n \"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional creations.\"\n \n The doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit for the addition of professional polish to my works.\"\n \n The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that looked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor would tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory and practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better equipped to judge whether we exist.\"\n \n There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had ever heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception to Relativity and the positron and negatron.\n \n \"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke.\n\"Presume that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory Perception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be. The great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we know them. The great literary creations assume reality.\"\n \n I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be the goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed redhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the detective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of unknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.\n \n His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal symptoms.\"\n \n The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building up behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He was not really a snowbird.\n \n After a time, I asked the doctor a question.\n \n \"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my professional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\"\n \n \n\n \n Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great and good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened. My heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote in sunlight and stepped toward it....\n \n ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.\n \n \n\n \n She inclined the lethal silver toy. \"Let me see those papers, Kevin.\"\n \n I handed her the doctor's manuscript.\n \n Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. \"It's all right. It's all right. It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read this myself.\"\n \n Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.\n \n \"Don't move, Kevin,\" she said. \"I'll have to shoot you—maybe not to kill, but painfully.\"\n \n I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I had known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there was something else.\n \n \"I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair,\" I told her.\n \n She shook her head. \"I don't know what you think it does to you.\"\n \n It was getting hard for me to think. \"Who are you?\"\n \n She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable, North American Mounted Police.\n \n I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. \"What do you want?\"\n \n \"Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found a method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical, topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it secret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist—he had his crusades. How can you make money with time travel?\"\n \n I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew was that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.\n \n \"It takes money—money Doc didn't have—to make money,\" Miss Casey said, \"even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will prosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of Doc's character. He was a scholar.\"\n \n Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared me. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I needed some coffee.\n \n \"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines for his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right—until he started obtaining books that did not exist .\"\n \n \n\n \n I didn't know what all that was supposed to mean. I got to the chair, snatched up the coffee container, tore it open and gulped down the soothing liquid.\n \n I turned toward her and threw the rest of the coffee into her face.\n \n The coffee splashed out over her platinum hair and powder-blue dress that looked white when the neon was azure, purple when it was amber. The coffee stained and soiled and ruined, and I was fiercely glad, unreasonably happy.\n \n I tore the gun away from her by the short barrel, not letting my filthy hands touch her scrubbed pink ones.\n \n I pointed the gun generally at her and backed around the thing on the floor to the cot. Doc had a pulse, but it was irregular. I checked for a fever and there wasn't one. After that, I didn't know what to do.\n \n I looked up finally and saw a Martian in or about the doorway.\n \n \"Call me Andre,\" the Martian said. \"A common name but foreign. It should serve as a point of reference.\"\n \n I had always wondered how a thing like a Martian could talk. Sometimes I wondered if they really could.\n \n \"You won't need the gun,\" Andre said conversationally.\n \n \"I'll keep it, thanks. What do you want?\"\n \n \"I'll begin as Miss Casey did—by telling you things. Hundreds of people disappeared from North America a few months ago.\"\n \n \"They always do,\" I told him.\n \n \"They ceased to exist—as human beings—shortly after they received a book from Doc,\" the Martian said.\n \n Something seemed to strike me in the back of the neck. I staggered, but managed to hold onto the gun and stand up.\n \n \"Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,\" I warned him,\n\"and I'll kill the girl.\" Martians were supposed to be against the destruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but it was worth a try.\n \n \"Kevin,\" Andre said, \"why don't you take a bath?\"\n \n The Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I tried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no matter how often I bathed. No words formed.\n \n \"But, Kevin,\" Andre said, \"you aren't that dirty.\"\n \n \n\n \n The blow shook the gun from my fingers. It almost fell into the thing on the floor, but at the last moment seemed to change direction and miss it.\n \n I knew something. \"I don't wash because I drink coffee.\"\n \n \"It's all right to drink coffee, isn't it?\" he asked.\n \n \"Of course,\" I said, and added absurdly, \"That's why I don't wash.\"\n \n \"You mean,\" Andre said slowly, ploddingly, \"that if you bathed, you would be admitting that drinking coffee was in the same class as any other solitary vice that makes people wash frequently.\"\n \n I was knocked to my knees.\n \n \"Kevin,\" the Martian said, \"drinking coffee represents a major vice only in Centurian humanoids, not Earth-norm human beings. Which are you? \"\n \n Nothing came out of my gabbling mouth.\n \n \" What is Doc's full name? \"\n \n I almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said,\n\"Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.\"\n \n From the bed, Doc said a word. \"Son.\"\n \n Then he disappeared.\n \n I looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in search of what.\n \n \"He didn't use that,\" Andre said.\n \n So I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in my mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind. I didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I had now. That and the thing he left.\n \n \"The rest is simple,\" Andre said. \"Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock in a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members with certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the Book of Dyzan or the Book of Thoth or the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan or the Necronomican itself on human beings?\"\n \n \"But they don't exist,\" I said wearily.\n \n \"Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They have never existed any more than your Victorian detective friend. But the unconscious racial mind has reached back into time and created them. And that unconscious mind, deeper than psychology terms the subconscious, has always known about the powers of ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, precognition. Through these books, the human race can tell itself how to achieve a state of pure logic, without food, without sex, without conflict—just as Doc has achieved such a state—a little late, true. He had a powerful guilt complex, even stronger than your withdrawal, over releasing this blessing on the inhabited universe, but reason finally prevailed. He had reached a state of pure thought.\"\n \n \"The North American government has to have this secret, Kevin,\" the girl said. \"You can't let it fall into the hands of the Martians.\"\n \n \n\n \n Andre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.\n \n I knew I could not let Doc's—Dad's—time travel thing fall into anyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had disappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.\n \n Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I don't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.\n \n I kicked the thing to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you can't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums before Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time travel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we weren't now.\n \n Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't mind her touching me.\n \n \"I'm glad,\" she said.\n \n Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?\n \n I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed it because I didn't want the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose, direction or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could kick the habit—perhaps with Miss Casey's help—but I wasn't really confident.\n \n Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material needs would not grow and roast coffee.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "06d8240dd7bb4a74a7b773fe9fac5b8d", "response_text": "John Kevin catches up with Doc, who has grabbed a human by the throat.

He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of soldiers—enemies and allies, both—that had engulfed the country in successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble that way.\n \n Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell him to call her \" Aunt Ninian \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little too crazy for that.\n \n He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry instead of mopping up the floor with him.\n \n \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin Conrad?\"\n \n \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n \n \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n \n Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it. You wouldn't understand.\"\n \n \"You're damn right. I don't understand. What's it all about in straight gas?\"\n \n \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\"\n \n \n\n \n So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to think it was disgusting.\n \n \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n \n She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n \n \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n \n And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in the streets—especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew how to give them the cold shoulder.\n \n One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so hard inside.\n \n But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and hired a private tutor for him. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n \n Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n \n \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical application to go by,\" she told him.\n \n He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a spectator.\n \n When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again, Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n \n \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she declared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n \n And keep an eye on him she did—she or a rather foppish young man who came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle Raymond.\n \n From time to time, there were other visitors—Uncles Ives and Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many more—all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.\n \n \n\n \n Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she was supposed to know better than he did.\n \n He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before, warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by more luxury than he knew what to do with.\n \n The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time and a freezer well stocked with food—somewhat erratically chosen, for Ninian didn't know much about meals.\n \n The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n \n Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd nearly killed him—but then there had also been times when she'd hugged and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n \n From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness. They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him, in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world—a world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than actually doing anything with the hands.\n \n In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands; everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of normal living.\n \n It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth. They came from the future.\n \n \n\n \n When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had promised five years before.\n \n \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n \n Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun, and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n \n \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond continued. \"Which is distressing—though, of course, it's not as if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about passing laws to do away with the—well, abuses and things like that, and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However, Conrad is so impatient.\"\n \n \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n \n \"I've told you—our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all. But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n \n He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food. All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how would they manage to live?\"\n \n \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how do you live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the past and think in the future.\n \n \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but if you will persist in these childish interruptions—\"\n \n \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n \n But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more frightening—his race had lost something vital.\n \n Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him, Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous—his feeling guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held accountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n \n \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking.\n \n \n\n \n Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this or don't you?\"\n \n \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n \n \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally officious—always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n \n Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas' assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way, there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n \n \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n \n Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the adolescent way,\" he said, \"to do away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole society in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n \n \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n \n \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea of eliminating our great-grandfather—because our great-grandfather was such a good man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of his great-grandfather's father—who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty worthless character.\"\n \n \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n \n Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you mustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us—the other cousins and me—held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He beamed at Martin.\n \n The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in eliminating me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n \n Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the cousins possessed to a consternating degree.\n \n \n\n \n Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n \n \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,\n\"and—ah—induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\"\n  Induced , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the use of the iron maiden.\n \n \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go—and here we are!\"\n \n \"I see,\" Martin said.\n \n Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms—I don't see what more you could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of course Ninian was a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our era has completely disposed of the mercantiles—\"\n \n \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n \n But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge, we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale. Ostentation—that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are, the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this wretched historical stint.\"\n \n \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her—or she, he knew, for him.\n \n \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n \n \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n \n Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him, you know.\"\n \n Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to protect me when he comes?\"\n \n \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no doubt, was a perfectly genuine—and lethal—weapon. \"And we've got a rather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n \n Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was dubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this house , but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this time ?\"\n \n \"Never fear—it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory guarantee and all that.\"\n \n \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have one of those guns, too.\"\n \n \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that myself!\"\n \n \n\n \n When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried—tears at her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the very last.\n \n Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his descendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n \n Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques, carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise, Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle—\"architecturally dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously typical\"—impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level aquarium.\n \n \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to go with a castle.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n \n \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place seem safer somehow.\"\n \n The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it, until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n \n During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of entertainment.\n \n \n\n \n \"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because, unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one just—well, drifts along happily.\"\n \n \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n \n \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you made up your mind what you want to be?\"\n \n Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.\n\"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n \n There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n \n \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen. Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n \n \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though, to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n \n \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n \n \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n \n \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly. Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of their times.\"\n \n \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n \n Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that other time?\"\n \n There was a chilly silence.\n \n \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be thankful we've saved you from that !\"\n \n So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was fear—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and walk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for the sake of an ideal.\n \n But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty pictures.\n \n \n\n \n Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the descendants cousin —next assumed guardianship. Ives took his responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not interested.\n \n \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n \n Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a change of air and scenery.\n \n \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it. Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n \n So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht, which Martin christened The Interregnum . They traveled about from sea to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in fragments; the nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n \n The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters, largely because they could spend so much time far away from the contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on The Interregnum . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through time.\n \n More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard ship, giving each other parties and playing an avant-garde form of shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of having got advance information about the results.\n \n Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\n \n \n\n \n He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue of their distinguished ancestry.\n \n \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n \n Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development. Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been deported.\n \n \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected himself. \"Maybe it is worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more. Bombed. Very thorough job.\"\n \n \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified—interested, even.\n \n \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the people—I expect you could call them people—there. Still—\" he smiled shamefacedly—\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed, could I?\"\n \n \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n \n \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except Conrad, and even he—\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better way out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to—to anything, if it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n \n \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he couldn't even seem to care.\n \n During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement. But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n \n He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from the future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to take a medical degree—but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n \n A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy about the entire undertaking.\n \n \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over Ives, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n \n But Martin disagreed.\n \n \n\n \n The ceaseless voyaging began again. The Interregnum voyaged to every ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell apart as the different oceans.\n \n \n\n \n All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust their elders.\n \n As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port for fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that era than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore, and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes that his other work lacked.\n \n When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way, he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the cousin's utter disgust.\n \n \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you do,\" the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were scraping bottom now—advised.\n \n Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored. However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer understand.\n \n \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked the current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now.\n \n The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time—waiting until we're off guard. And then—pow!—he'll attack!\"\n \n \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n \n He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one conversation, anyhow.\n \n \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching his ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n \n Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had given up carrying a gun long ago.\n \n There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so The Interregnum voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel and man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long time. The Interregnum roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n \n \n\n \n Perhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air—perhaps it\n was the sheltered life—but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was a\n hundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when\n the family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no\n hope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life.\n \n All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to\n their progenitor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and\n Raymond—all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,\n spilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the\n deck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed.\n \n Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had\n been spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming young\n people—all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed\n never to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see\n relief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their\n responsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal\n pity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered so\n irretrievably.\n \n \n\n \n There was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn't\n a strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it in\n the looking glass when he was a young man.\n \n \"You must be Conrad,\" Martin called across the cabin in a voice that\n was still clear. \"I've been looking forward to meeting you for some\n time.\"\n \n The other cousins whirled to face the newcomer.\n \n \"You're too late, Con,\" Raymond gloated for the whole generation. \"He's\n lived out his life.\"\n \n \"But he hasn't lived out his life,\" Conrad contradicted. \"He's lived\n out the life you created for him. And for yourselves, too.\"\n \n For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his\n lineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there.\n \n \"Don't you realize even yet,\" Conrad went on, \"that as soon as he goes,\n you'll go, too—present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go up\n in the air like puffs of smoke?\"\n \n \"What do you mean?\" Ninian quavered, her soft, pretty face alarmed.\n \n Martin answered Conrad's rueful smile, but left the explanations up to\n him. It was his show, after all.\n \n \"Because you will never have existed,\" Conrad said. \"You have no right\n to existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time,\n so he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married, have\n children ....\"\n \n \n\n \n Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.\n \n \"I knew from the very beginning,\" Conrad finished, \"that I didn't\n have to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroy\n yourselves.\"\n \n \"I don't understand,\" Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of the\n cousins closest to him. \"What does he mean, we have never existed?\n We're here, aren't we? What—\"\n \n \"Shut up!\" Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. \"You don't seem\n surprised.\"\n \n The old man grinned. \"I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.\"\n \n At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better to\n throw them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? He\n had decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him—to\n watch and wait and keep out of things—and that was the role he would\n play.\n \n \"You knew all the time and you didn't tell us!\" Raymond spluttered.\n\"After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you instead\n of a criminal.... That's right,\" he snarled, \"a criminal! An alcoholic,\n a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?\"\n \n \"Sounds like a rich, full life,\" Martin said wistfully.\n \n What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, he\n couldn't help thinking, he—he and Conrad together, of course—had done\n them out of any kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,\n though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course was\n destined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the better\n course, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt inside\n him. Strange—where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly have\n developed such a queer thing as a conscience?\n \n \"Then we've wasted all this time,\" Ninian sobbed, \"all this energy, all\n this money, for nothing!\"\n \n \"But you were nothing to begin with,\" Martin told them. And then,\n after a pause, he added, \"I only wish I could be sure there had been\n some purpose to this.\"\n \n He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,\n or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growing\n shadowy.\n \n \"I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you be\n wiped out of existence,\" he went on voicing his thoughts. \"But I know\n that the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world will\n happen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It's\n bound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.\"\n \n One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he told\n himself. Two men, that was—one real, one a shadow.\n \n Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.\n \n \"No,\" he said, \"there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitter\n works two ways. I used it for going into the past only once—just this\n once. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And—\" he\n pressed Martin's hand—\"believe me, what I did—what we did, you and\n I—serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everything\n is going to be all right.\"\n \n \n\n \n Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\n giving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\n he trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\n thing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\n right.\n \n Was Conrad actually different from the rest?\n \n His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\n consisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\n nothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\n had stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n \n \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\n have fulfilled my original destiny—that I am a criminal.\"\n \n Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\n blame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\n men's future—other men's problem.

We first see Martin following the disappearance of his mother - and lack of a father - which are commonplace in the neighborhood he grows up in where the kids rarely attend school and their living conditions are poor. Martin is taken in by a young woman, Ninian, who instructs him to call her Aunt Ninian despite being identified as his future descendant. Ninian has traveled back in time to her great-great-grandfather - Martin - in order to protect him from his future son Conrad. Conrad, described as an idealist, is dismayed by the future generations exploitation of Earth and destructive social order that casts out anyone and everything that doesn't encompass the privileged and elite. To correct the wrongdoings of the future, Conrad plans to kill Martin. The rest of Conrad’s cousins intercept this plan and instead, all decide to travel into the past to accompany Martin and protect him from an assassination attempt. \n\nMartin’s formative years are accompanied by Ninian, Raymond and Ives where he picks up art as a career, forms impersonal relationships with his descendants and learns more about the past and future quality of life. As years pass with no threat of Conrad in sight, Martin begins to explore his world alongside Ives on a yacht named The Interregnum. Soon though, the cousins that come and go begin to blur together and Martin picks up a detached view of the world as his interest wanes in his sheltered life. Martin lives to a very old age, and on his deathbed aboard the yacht, he is surrounded by all his descendants besides Ives, who passed of sickness earlier before. It is at this moment that Conrad appears, seemingly to finish his murder plot. However, it is revealed that no action was required to be taken by Conrad, as his fellow cousins have already achieved the mission of erasing their lineage. By containing Martin to a sheltered life, the cousins prevented Martin from living his normal life with a wife and kids, thus removing the possibility of their existence in the past, present and future. Furthermore, it is revealed that Martin had come to the same conclusion years ago, and chose instead to keep quiet out of his disdain for his descendants. With the cousins horrified at the knowledge, Conrad reassures Martin that their inaction resulted in hope, and Martin ponders to wonder if the assurance was genuine as he peacefully dies alone on the boat. \n"}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "0784e4f29ffd49f8a1a30aa6951e2062", "response_text": "Martin’s mother disappears, but nobody is surprised because mothers usually disappear around these parts.

Ninian, however, tells him that she is protecting him from her cousin Conrad who is coming to kill him in the future. His living conditions have improved, but Martin misses his old neighborhood where he could play with the other children. Ninian and her relatives only take care of him as if it is some unpleasant duty; he learns that nobody works with hands anymore in their world because it is all done by machinery. When Martin turns sixteen, Raymond tells him about Conrad and his idealist ideas of making living fairer for the exploited natives on other planets. Conrad blames his great-grandfather for discovering the super drive. Conrad then bribes one of Professor Farka’s assistants to reveal information about a time transmitter, and he plans to go back in time to eliminate the common ancestor. Raymond explains that they got plans from another assistant and a handicrafts enthusiast to build another gadget. They could guard over Martin day and night so Conrad could not attack. Raymond explains that Ninian is leaving, and Martin feels oddly desolate because of their time together. When she leaves, Ninian cries at her inadequacy; Martin and Raymond move to a luxurious mansion in a remote area that protects them from the Second Atomic War. The relatives come back to hold meetings; Martin thinks he wants to be a physicist or engineer, but the relatives insist that he should be a painter. Ives eventually takes over and displays his art in a museum, and he buys a yacht called The Interregnum to go traveling.

She hires private tutors for him and soon decides to move to a better neighborhood and live in a big well-furnished house. Occasionally, the other descendants, like Ives or Raymond, also visit them and talk about the future where almost nobody works, and everything is done by machinery. Martin turns sixteen when Raymond finally tells him the full story: Raymond's brother Conrad was disappointed by the fact that the humans of his time exploited the other life forms on the other planets to get food and resources. He decided to eliminate their common ancestor - Martin -  so that no space travel inventions would have existed. The others - cousins as he should call them - went back in time to save him and, consequently, save themselves. Martin also learns about the security system and the collection of weaponry they have to protect him. Soon Ninian leaves, and Martin, together with Raymond, moves into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. They talk about Martin’s future occupation. Though he prefers engineering or physics, they choose art to avoid any accidental premature inventions he can create since he is already familiar with the science of the future. Martin becomes a second-rate artist, and his new guardian - Ives - arrives. He decides to buy a yacht - The Interregnum - and see the rest of the world with Martin. Martin doesn’t develop any special feelings for his ancestors, except for Ives. Martin learns more about the future from him: only an enclave of a couple of million people left on Earth, and representatives of the lower classes got deported to the other planets and are being exploited; several worlds have already been made inhabitable. Ives admits that his brother is not completely wrong, but he still cannot let him destroy his life. \n\nOne winter, Ives rapidly dies from a severe chill in Tierra del Fuego after they stopped there for a bit. Years go by, and Martin loses any interest in life, sometimes painting the sea view from the yacht. They stop in Italy, and he sells two paintings.

He shocks all the gathered ancestors by explaining that the sheltered life they had created for Martin didn’t allow him to live his own life, or at least, have kids. When he dies, everyone will disappear, too. Martin figured it out years ago. Conrad assures him that his deed leads to a better future because he has been there.

They were something\n  \n more—and something less—they were,\n  \n in short, humanity's hopes for survival!\n \n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  \n Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n  \n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  \n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n\n\n The Starship\n \n  Pandora\n \n creaked and groaned as her landing pads settled\n unevenly in the mucky surface of the ugly world outside. She seemed to\n be restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\n the waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\n through her hallways.\n \n\n Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\n a big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\n had pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\n reddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\n were rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\n control room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n \n\n Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\n moved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\n need a shave.\"\n \n\n \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\n hand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\n during the night?\"\n \n\n \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\n north of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\n clouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\n knew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\n an almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\n our two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\n in the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n \n\n Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\n in the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\n as cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\n Pinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n \n\n Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\n seemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\n and harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\n their internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\n on their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n \n\n But\n \n  something\n \n had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\n back, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\n up.\n \n\n He turned to the port to stare out at the planet. The Sol-type sun\n must be rising, since there was a dim light. But the thick clouds that\n wrapped the entire world diffused its rays into a haze. For a change,\n it wasn't raining, though the ground was covered by thick swirls of\n fog. In the distance, the tops of shrubs that made a scrub forest\n glowed yellow-green. Motions around them suggested a herd of feeding\n animals. Details were impossible to see through the haze. Even the\n deep gorge where they'd found Hennessy's carefully buried ship was\n completely hidden by the fog.\n \n\n There were three of the blobs dancing about over the grazing animals\n now, as they often seemed to do. Gwayne stared at them for a minute,\n trying to read sense into the things. If he had time to study them....\n \n\n But there was no time.\n \n\n Earth had ordered him to detour here, after leaving his load of\n deep-sleep stored colonists on Official World 71, to check on any sign\n of Hennessy. He'd been here a week longer than he should have stayed\n already. If there was no sign in another day or so of what had happened\n to the men who'd deserted their ship and its equipment, he'd have to\n report back.\n \n\n He would have left before, if a recent landslip hadn't exposed enough\n of the buried ship for his metal locators to spot from the air by\n luck. It had obviously been hidden deep enough to foil the detectors\n originally.\n \n\n \"Bob!\" Jane Corey's voice cut through his pondering. \"Bob, there are\n the kids!\"\n \n\n Before he could swing to follow her pointing finger, movement caught\n his eye.\n \n\n The blobs had left the herd. Now the three were streaking at fantastic\n speed to a spot near the ship, to hover excitedly above something that\n moved there.\n \n\n He saw the two cadets then, heading back to the waiting ship, just\n beyond the movement he'd seen through the mist.\n \n\n Whatever was making the fog swirl must have reached higher ground.\n Something began to heave upwards. It was too far to see clearly, but\n Gwayne grabbed the microphone, yelling into the radio toward the cadets.\n \n\n They must have seen whatever it was just as the call reached them.\n Young Kaufman grabbed at Pinelli, and they swung around together.\n \n\n Then the mists cleared.\n \n\n Under the dancing blobs, a horde of things was heading for the cadets.\n Shaggy heads, brute bodies vaguely man-like! One seemed to be almost\n eight feet tall, leading the others directly toward the spacesuited\n cadets. Some of the horde were carrying spears or sticks. There was a\n momentary halt, and then the leader lifted one arm, as if motioning the\n others forward.\n \n\n \"Get the jeeps out!\" Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door of\n the little officers' lift open and jabbed the down button. It was\n agonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door\n back at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in\n confusion. But someone was taking over now—one of the crew women. The\n jeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and\n Gwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.\n \n\n There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was\n irritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to\n the seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the\n jeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked\n up speed. The other two followed.\n \n\n There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;\n surrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked\n horrible in a travesty of manhood.\n \n\n The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were\n racing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung\n about, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty\n miles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in\n spite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived\n downward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.\n \n\n \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool to\n leave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the\n kids. But it was too late to go back.\n \n\n The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into\n a gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he\n had to slow as the fog thickened lower down.\n \n\n Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own\n trail to confuse the pursuers.\n \n\n There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a\n glimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse\n faces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the\n windshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the\n steering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.\n \n\n The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The\n other jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late\n to help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or\n the horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.\n \n\n A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.\n \n\n He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature\n seemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.\n \n\n Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward\n against the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot\n leader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on each\n shoulder.\n \n\n The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creature\n leaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, diving\n for the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt.\n \n\n The arms were thin and grotesque below the massively distorted\n shoulders, but amazingly strong. Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his\n hands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his\n nose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after\n the captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy\n sound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no\n further move, though it was still breathing.\n \n\n Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli\n was either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to\n kick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded\n onto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster\n on another before heading back.\n \n\n \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook\n his own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing.\n \n\n \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live—and you're\n detailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign\n language or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy\n and why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the\n answer.\"\n \n\n Barker nodded grimly. \"I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alien\n metabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spat\n sickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still\n makes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was\n no sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\"\n \n\n \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get\n anything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstaying\n our time here already.\"\n \n\n The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd been\n picked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were\n busy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon\n as he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less\n informative with retelling.\n \n\n If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save\n time and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. That\n was almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed\n to be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group had\n been overcome by the aliens.\n \n\n It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the\n primitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was its\n fuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told\n these creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by a\n little more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the ship\n cunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.\n \n\n Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find\n something—and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could make\n remotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction.\n \n\n The race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons\n into a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to\n prevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found\n a drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent life\n there to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.\n \n\n But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had\n finally proved that the sun was going to go nova.\n \n\n It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go—but it would\n render the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,\n man had to colonize.\n \n\n And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The\n explorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the\n terraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships\n began filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve\n space.\n \n\n Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and\n four more months back.\n \n\n In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the\n footholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe some\n of the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe none\n would be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each was\n precious as a haven for the race.\n \n\n If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, as\n it now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.\n \n\n Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to\n strip them of their world, but the first law was survival.\n \n\n But how could primitives do what these must have done?\n \n\n He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of\n cemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully\n laminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human\n hand had been able to do for centuries.\n \n\n \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered.\n \n\n Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can\n see a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested.\n \n\n He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were\n squatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.\n They were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?\n For the return of their leader—or for something that would give the\n ship to them?\n \n\n Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How's the captive coming?\"\n \n\n Barker's voice sounded odd.\n \n\n \"Physically fine. You can see him. But—\"\n \n\n Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore\n at Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not\n checking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.\n \n\n There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling\n sound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker\n seemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.\n \n\n The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The\n thick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make\n some kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up\n unerringly toward the device on the officer's cap.\n \n\n \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said.\n \n\n \"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\"\n Barker said. There was a grin on the doctor's lips, but his face was\n taut with strain.\n \n\n The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on\n its head. It was the golden comet of a captain.\n \n\n \"He never meant to hurt the kids—just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\n quickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed. He can't talk very\n well. Says they've had to change the language around to make the sounds\n fit, and he's forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it\n gets easier as you listen. It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n \n\n Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\n on the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\n English, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n \n\n \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\n kid's dog have? How many were brown?\"\n \n\n The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the\n curiously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment\n spread out.\n \n\n Three. Seven. Zero.\n \n\n The answers were right.\n \n\n By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the\n twisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a\n long time telling.\n \n\n When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in\n silence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it\n possible, Doc?\"\n \n\n \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not\n by what I know. But it happened. I've looked at a few tissues under\n the microscope. The changes are there. It's hard to believe about\n their kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can't be\n a hereditary change—the things that affect the body don't change the\n germ plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe\n the fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\"\n \n\n Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped\n down to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of\n monsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as\n tall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high.\n \n\n The kids of the exploring party....\n \n\n Back in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers,\n set the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgle\n as the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto the\n ground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to the\n ship again.\n \n\n He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd had\n time to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,\n however much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting off\n giving the gist of it to Jane.\n \n\n \"It was the blobs,\" he summarized it. \"They seem to be amused by men.\n They don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessy\n doesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,\n all life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen.\n \n\n \"And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside the\n hull. It doesn't show yet—but we're changed. In another month, Earth\n food would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeper\n this time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colony\n where three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll never\n know.\"\n \n\n Nobody would know. Their children—odd children who matured in eight\n years—would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earth\n tools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.\n Nothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the new\n eyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world.\n \n\n She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what must\n now be her home. Then she sighed. \"You'll need practice, but the others\n don't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'll\n believe it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really been\n changed yet, have we?\"\n \n\n \"No,\" he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. \"No.\n They have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.\"\n \n\n She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was only\n puzzlement in her face. \"Why?\"\n \n\n And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her the\n same answer he had found for himself. \"The spawning ground!\"\n \n\n It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant her\n seed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preserve\n that seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already were\n becoming uncertain.\n \n\n Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead of\n men having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strange\n children of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek back\n to civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhaps\n some of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the next\n rise to culture a better one.\n \n\n \"We're needed here,\" he told her, his voice pleading for the\n understanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. \"These people need\n as rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.\n The fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them with\n a decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe or\n accept the idea—or even let us come back. We have to stay here.\"\n \n\n She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. \"Be\n fruitful,\" she whispered. \"Be fruitful and spawn and replenish an\n earth.\"\n \n\n \"No,\" he told her. \"Replenish the stars.\"\n \n\n But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.\n \n\n Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanes\n again, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, they\n could adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead them\n through all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyond\n numbering.\n \n\n Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for the\n children of men!", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "112", "uid": "433c25c82cc749389b26ea9f22686d22", "response_text": "The Starship Pandora lands on a planet where an exploring ship and a rescue group disappear. Captain Gwayne was ordered to come and inspect the lost ships for a week.

When two cadets, Kaufman and Pinelli, and one member, Doctor Barker, approach to examine the buried ship, a horde of mysterious creatures come to them. The leader of mysterious creatures, tall and man-like, kidnaps the two cadets with his members and runs away. Captain Gwayne and other crew members ride on jeeps and chase after the monsters.

He reveals that the blobs, a peculiarity on the planet, can change the cells in living creatures to help them adapt to the planet, which has done to Captain Hennessy and his crew members. All the mysterious creatures surrounding the ship are either the original crew members or their descendants. They decided to bury the ship after noticing the changes. After he finished the story, Captain Hennessy went to gather with his people. And now, Captain Gwayne faces the same situation as Captain Hennessy did in the past: either die when they go back to the Earth or stay on the planet to become a different creature, which at least makes humankind survive differently. Captain Gwayne decides to stay, so he discharges all the fuel out to not let the ship live again. He then tells Jane Corey, the Lieutenant, the truth and his decision. They both know that they have to stay for the better strength of the species after generations because humankind needs to have at least one hope to spread their seeds, even in a different shape.

Accompanied by Lieutenant Jane Corey, he is informed that two of the space cadets snuck outside the ship. Among the outside landscape includes blobs, who are described to be a peculiarity of this particular planet; seemingly harmless but are ugly in looks.\n\nGwayne wishes to study them more thoroughly, but is reminded of his mission in deviating to this planet to search for Captain Hennessey and his men, who had abandoned their ship. As the cadets are heading back to Gwayne’s ship, a herd of blobs disperses in excitement and instead they begin to hover over a singular spot. The cadets turn to find a horde of things heading towards them, described to be vaguely man-like with a distinct leader at eight feet tall, and all of them holding objects like spears or sticks. In a race to reach the cadets before the things did, Gwayne, Jane and other officers raced in Jeeps towards the boys. Noticing the incoming Jeeps, the creatures grabbed the boys and disappeared into the mists, with the officers following fast in pursuit. Plowing through them, Gwayne touches a blob whose shape passes around it. As they confront the eight foot leader, it suddenly drops the boys and Gwayne and Doc Barker knock it out of consciousness. \n\nWith the boys safe, they take the unconscious creature back to the ship to try and see if the creature had anything to do with Hennessey’s disappearance and buried ship. Any information revealed would be pivotal in determining this planet’s habitability, as it is revealed that Earth was threatened with the Sun going nova and hence the human race found themselves in a scramble to find a replacement home. Gwayne and Jane then visit Barker and the now-awake creature, who immediately greets Gwayne in some garbled English. They find out that the leader of the creature is actually Captain Hennessy who had grabbed the kids with the intention of talking to them. It turns out that Hennessey and his crew have physically changed due to the planet, turning them into man-like creatures with an adapted English language. \n\nMore so, it is revealed that blobs enjoy having the humans around, and are subtly changing and adapting the human cells. It is what happened to Hennessy and is already happening to Gwayne because he’s been touched. However, the rest of his crew could go back but are unable to because Gwayne has dumped the fuel. In the end, we find out that Gwayne and Jane consider the answer to finding a new planet to be void, as they only thing they could do is find a new spawning ground, which they would be able to achieve if both crews spawn a new race on this planet and eventually, explore the star lanes once again. \n"}, {"worker_id": "111", "uid": "2e7ac0d328af449aaf0169a3bb6ddd4e", "response_text": "The story is about a ship captain, Gwayne, and his team arriving on a new planet.

The starship is two hundred light-years away from Earth. Captain Gwayne curses and reaches for his boots; he shuffles to the control room where Lieutenant Jane Corey is waiting. Jane reports that a dozen mysterious blobs held a convention north, but they had broken off about an hour ago. She also informs him that the two cadets have snuck out again, to which Gwayne swears because Kaufman and Pinelli have no sense of caution. The Sol-type Sun begins to rise, but there is so much fog everywhere that it is impossible to see. He observes three blobs but knows that there is no time because Earth sent him here to check for any signs of Hennessy’s ship. Suddenly, Jane calls him to say that the two cadets are back. Strange creatures appear, and Gwayne yells at Jane to get the jeeps out. Once they drive, the menacing horde notices the jeeps and begins to run away with the cadets faster. Although the creatures try to stop their pursuers, the jeep goes through and catches a glimpse. Once the creature with the two cadets is in front of him, Gwayne dives to get the cadets back. Doc Barker hits the creature seconds after, and this causes the creature to collapse. The men examine the cadets, while Doc and Gwayne wonder if the creature could be the key to the missing ship. They discuss how the native creatures could have gone undetected, while Gwayne explains that it is time for him to go and get the ship back to Earth. The report from the cadets is enough, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the creatures and the missing crew. However, there needs to be an answer fast because Earth is close to extinction from the Sun. Since nobody would be able to live in the Solar System when that happens, the explorers must go out and find another world. Everybody does their part because the Sun will explode in ten years, while some of the strange planets would give man the opportunity to repopulate. Gwayne receives a call from Doc Barker and goes to see the creature. The creature is Captain Hennessy, and he has forgotten how to speak English because they had to change the language to make the sounds fit. When Gwayne questions the creature, it answers correctly; they listen to Hennessy’s story. Gwayne leads former Hennessy out and goes back to the control room to discharge the ship’s fuel tanks. It is revealed that the blobs can adapt to cells and have no choice but to stay because they are already changed.

KASTLE\n \n\n Illustrated by von Dongen\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n on this publication was renewed.]\n  The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be\n welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a\n hero...?\n \n \n There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual\n speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had\n once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had\n since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything\n wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as\n at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming—for Corporal Berringer,\n one of the crew of the spaceship Washington , first to set Americans\n upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His\n Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n \n Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the\n hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal\n tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat\n between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,\n and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National\n Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of\n the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their\n parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous\n national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them\n come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as\n they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these—as the\n newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century—the\n Galloping Twenties.\n \n He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man\n and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than\n any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a\n kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old\n friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.\n He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps\n he would talk.\n \n Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had\n returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great\n mariners, from Columbus onward—long, dull periods of time passing,\n passing, and then the arrival.\n \n The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him\n off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.\n They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,\n almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had\n wanted it to be as before.\n \n The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had\n escorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.\n He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with\n strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing\n beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,\n their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was\n still too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n \n He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate\n flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental\n knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was\n surprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching\n at a window.\n \n And perhaps she had been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n \n The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she\n hadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved\n in high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.\n Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual\n support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They\n looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,\n\"It's good to be home!\"\n \n Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other\n arm around him. He kissed her—her neck, her cheek—and all the old\n jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the\n and- then -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.\n She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the\n difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to\n Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could\n think of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n \n Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the\n floor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I\n didn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n \n So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that\n everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General\n Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left\n Washington.\n \n \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need\n the time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\"\n \n \n \n Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,\n a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat\n down beside him—but she had hesitated. He wasn't being sensitive; she\n had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\n \n Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De\n Gama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon—but more\n so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked\n with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic\n journey—even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius\n in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another.\n  The eyes. It always showed in their eyes.\n \n \n He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy\n already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of\n feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself\n twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a\n way that few ten-year-old faces are.\n \n \"How's it going in school?\" he asked.\n \n \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\"\n \n \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\n \n \"Pretty good.\"\n \n Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and\n he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\n \n He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the\n warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as\n he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had\n feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in\n continent-to-continent experimental flight.\n \n They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.\n But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the\n long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt\n and the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's\n Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,\n he waved his hand—it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook—and\n ran from the room and from the house.\n \n He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in\n his arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very\n tired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd\n been lying down all the months of the way back.\n \n She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and\n make small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\n \n He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do—make small talk\n and pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;\n they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much.\n \n \n \n She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past\n the small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was\n newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an\n ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more\n ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire\n fence around the experimental station.\n \n \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\n \n She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the\n fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you\n to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.\n You always said it reminded you—being able to see the sky—that you\n were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it\n to this bed again.\"\n \n \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\n \n \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom\n set and I really didn't know—\" She waved her hand, her face white.\n \n He was sure then that she had known, and that the beds and the barrier\n between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went\n to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,\n began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars\n still showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\n \n She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\n \n He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite\n wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the\n scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing\n diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.\n There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd\n been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen\n them.\n \n Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would\n keep them from her until they were gone.\n \n Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter\n Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found\n distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,\n he began to understand that there would be many things, previously\n beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;\n Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably\n changed—because they thought he had changed.\n \n He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let\n himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known\n before.\n \n But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began\n filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same\n man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and\n friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could\n communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One\n would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for—a\n return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash\n instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be\n granted to him.\n \n He slept.\n \n \n \n Dinner was at seven\n p.m.\n His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille\n came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate\n in the dining room at the big table.\n \n Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His\n family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of\n talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes—especially with\n company present—to describe everything and anything that had happened\n to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially\n with his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been\n good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\n \n This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\"\n was perhaps the word.\n \n They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,\n efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked\n at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,\n\"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times\n before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip\n something like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time\n she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was\n the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort\n her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\n \n He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched\n her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move\n it—she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool\n embrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it\n drop out of sight.\n \n So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,\n the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\n \n The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe\n began to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform\n houses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.\n\"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before—\" At that point he\n looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in\n this normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,\n mumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a\n little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\n \n Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday\n Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between\n Joe and Mother—his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt\n alone—and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose\n bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or\n trowel.\"\n \n Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that—a pitiful twitching of\n the lips—and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,\n and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I\n have a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a\n while.\" She touched his shoulder in passing—his affectionate, effusive\n mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often\n irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses—she barely\n touched his shoulder and fled.\n \n So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served—thin, rare\n slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He\n cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie\n and said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"\n Ralphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and\n murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said\n Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going\n into the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of\n course,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\n \n Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at\n Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was\n chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at\n Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\n \n He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass\n overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They\n were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big\n right fist—Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a\n scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the\n First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear\n of, that he could have smashed more than a table.\n \n Edith said, \"Hank!\"\n \n He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of\n the lot of you.\"\n \n \n \n Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food\n down his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear—\" He didn't answer. She began\n to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said\n anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been\n the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about\n getting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"\n and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\n \n He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special\n dessert she'd been preparing half the day—a magnificent English trifle.\n She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She\n hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the\n boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the\n table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,\n\"Hey, I promised—\"\n \n \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or\n something; anything to get away from your father.\"\n \n Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\n \n Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening\n together—talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\n \n Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\n \n Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I\n want to. The question is whether you want to.\"\n \n They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their\n eyes—his wife's and son's eyes—could not meet his, and so he said he\n was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in\n all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that\n they shouldn't count on him for normal social life.\n \n He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\n \n But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a\n lighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,\n and it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I\n could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want\n to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\n \n He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful\n times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and\n closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\n \n Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down!\n \n \n \n It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd\n also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to\n expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded\n very much the way he always had—soft spoken and full of laughter and\n full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and\n clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had—so much\n more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was\n good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along\n on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n \n They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to\n Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee\n and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he\n merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n \n There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there\n many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized\n him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as\n if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n \n At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he\n said, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his\n mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her\n face—pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual\n of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going\n to be sick.\n \n \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n \n They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.\n And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,\n mechanical dancing doll.\n \n The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,\n\"Beddy-bye time.\"\n \n Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n \n He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited\n for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.\n Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her\n face—no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes—that made him know\n she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when\n the music ended, he was ready to go home.\n \n They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of\n Phil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,\n Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old\n self. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with\n the First One.\n \n They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and\n Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and\n looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence\n paralleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's\n the most popular place on earth?\"\n \n Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a\n little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a\n while longer, not yet aware of his supposed faux pas .\n \n \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter\n rumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n \n Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at—\"\n \n Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n \n Phil said, \"Because people are—\" And then he caught himself and waved\n his hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n \n \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the\n window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting\n tombstones.\n \n The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been\n nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should\n let me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home—or that's what everyone\n seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that\n would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or\n another monster from the movies.\"\n \n Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\"\n \n The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four\n blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He\n didn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path\n and entered the house.\n \n \n \n \"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry—\"\n \n \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll\n all work out in time.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a\n little time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.\n I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt\n you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're\n frightened.\"\n \n \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as\n necessary. For good if need be.\"\n \n \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\n \n That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since\n returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,\n even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\n \n \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right\n now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I\n did—seven months ago next Wednesday—he's going to be next. He was\n smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost\n ready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save\n all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man\n loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,\n he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and\n organ process—the process that made it all possible. So people have to\n get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old\n superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of\n us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\"\n \n Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please\n believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and—\" She paused.\n\"There's one question.\"\n \n He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by\n everyone from the president of the United States on down.\n \n \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half\n months—slept without dreaming.\"\n \n She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was\n satisfied.\n \n Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of\n how they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and\n pulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own\n home.\n \n \n THE END", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "113", "uid": "450fa16d4c944058b51490bd17a280ba", "response_text": "The story is about a family man - Henry Devers - returning to his hometown after a unique adventure.

Again everyone seems aloof: Henry’s overly affectionate mother now barely touches him and even cries for several minutes, his aunt and uncle cannot talk about casual things - no one looks him in the eyes. After all, Devers gets infuriated and screams at the guests, they leave, and his son once again tries to leave instead of spending time with the parents. Later in the evening, Edith wakes her husband because his good friends Phil and Rhona came - they all go to bowling alleys and then to a tavern.

Svan was the leader making the final plans—plotting them a bit too well.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Winter 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n The Officer of the Deck was pleased as he returned to the main lock. There was no reason why everything shouldn't have been functioning perfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the same. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open lock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He turned.\n \n \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented.\n \n The OD nodded. \"I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said.\n\"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers ready to lift as soon as they come back.\"\n \n The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \" If they come back.\"\n \n \"Is there any question?\"\n \n The Exec shrugged. \"I don't know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny place. I don't trust the natives.\"\n \n Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they're human beings, just like us—\"\n \n \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't even look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don't like them.\"\n \n \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate themselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.\"\n \n The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the outskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present Venusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from the Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned proton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing wonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of guards.\n \n \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there's a minority who are afraid of us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives. They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we know Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground group that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the native Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that is—right down into the mud. Well—\" he laughed—\"maybe they will. After all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of—\"\n \n The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic voice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments reports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\n \n Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and stared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure enough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\n\"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly and went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\n \n The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\n \n \n\n \n \"You see?\"\n \n Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five others in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n \n The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her head. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n \n Svan laughed harshly. \" They don't think so. You heard them. We are not human any more. The officer said it.\"\n \n The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she agreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n \n Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still object?\"\n \n The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly convinced by Svan.\n \n \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n \n \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n \n Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of assent.\n \n \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the Earth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not return.\"\n \n An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he complained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n \n Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to Earth.\"\n \n \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council authorized—murder?\"\n \n Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the Earth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you object?\"\n \n Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was dull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n \n Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his feet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the ship. It will be set by means of this dial—\" he touched a spot on the surface of the globe with a pallid finger—\"to do nothing for forty hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.\"\n \n He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty, irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a mark on one of them, held it up.\n \n \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n \n No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that bowl.\"\n \n Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm of her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly creasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it with his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n \n She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their slips.\n \n Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation. The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough, after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n \n There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n \n Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled. Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over, striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n \n And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance. Almost he was disappointed.\n \n Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen one to announce it—a second, ten seconds....\n \n Then gray understanding came to him. A traitor! his subconscious whispered. A coward! He stared at them in a new light, saw their indecision magnified, became opposition.\n \n Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision. Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly beneath the table, marked his own slip.\n \n In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in secret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n \n \n\n \n The six conspirators in Svan's old ground car moved slowly along the main street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except for deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the entrance to the town's Hall of Justice.\n \n \"Good,\" said Svan, observing them. \"The delegation is still here. We have ample time.\"\n \n He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered. Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?\n \n The right answer leaped up at him. They all are , he thought. Not one of them understands what this means. They're afraid.\n \n \n He clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was driving. \"Let's get this done with.\"\n \n She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite dark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them, illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.\n \n A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence that followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: \"Halt!\"\n \n The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.\n \n \"Where are you going?\" he growled.\n \n Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened the door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard it was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is that not permitted?\"\n \n The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The order was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\"\n \n Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It is urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a complicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\"\n \n Confusion furrowed the guard's hairless brows, then was replaced by a sudden flare of understanding—and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared.\n\"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—\" He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was faster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining. He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength in his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had ruthlessly pounded it against the road.\n \n \n Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.\n \n\n \n Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously, then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be no trace.\n \n Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep a watch for other guards.\"\n \n \n\n \n Venus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer. Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.\n \n \"Can't see a thing,\" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away at the computer's table. \"Look—are those lights over there?\"\n \n The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. \"Probably the guards. Of course, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party.\"\n \n Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no answer in his stolid face. \"Don't joke about it,\" he said. \"Suppose something happens to the delegation?\"\n \n \"Then we're in the soup,\" the Exec said philosophically. \"I told you the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They've been prohibited for the last three hundred years.\"\n \n \"It isn't all the natives,\" Lowry said. \"Look how they've doubled the guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they know how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's this secret group they call the Council.\"\n \n \"And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it?\" the Exec retorted. \"They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's gone out now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to be coming from the town, anyhow....\"\n \n \n\n \n Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed. Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been two bombs in the compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one.\n \n He got out of the car, holding the sphere. \"This will do for me,\" he said. \"They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?\"\n \n Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. \"We must circle back again,\" she parroted. \"We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.\"\n \n Svan, listening, thought: It's not much of a plan. The guards would not be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. If they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a purpose.\n \n \n Aloud, he said, \"You understand. If I get through, I will return to the city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember, you are in no danger from the guards.\"\n  From the guards , his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a ground-shaking crash.\n \n Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting off the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\"\n \n \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached for him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said.\n \n \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around, sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.\n \n Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean? Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?\n \n There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.\n \n He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by its own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circling figures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own. They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the side of the ship.\n \n Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance. He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?\n \n \n\n \n He became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car was racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.\n \n Paralyzed, he heard the girl's voice. \"Svan! They're coming! They found the guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan, with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came for you. We must flee!\"\n \n He stared unseeingly at the light. \"Go away!\" he croaked unbelievingly. Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb in the car—\n \n \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....\n \n The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He's still alive,\" he said callously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won't last long, though. What've you got there?\"\n \n Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a connection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car, and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.\"\n \n \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won't do any bombing now.\"\n \n Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered. The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.\n \n \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It's poetic justice if I ever saw it. They had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of paper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don't get,\" he said.\n \n \"What's that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on it? What about it?\"\n \n The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had the devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over slowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\"", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "112", "uid": "57f8b65bd11d491dbf6c73685c2779d6", "response_text": "Svan, a leader of members in the Council on Venus, plots to revolt against the Earthman delegations who are going to bring back the news of the habitability of Venus.

These natives were in fact the descendants of the first group of humans that arrived on venus. Even though they are humans, their physical appearance has adapted to the venusian atmosphere. When the humans arrive, a group of natives called “The Council” decided to bomb the ship of the humans. To decide the person who would sneak on the ship to plant the bomb, the natives marked a slip with an X and randomly picked slips. When no one came forward, the leader of the natives, Svan, decided to do it himself. Because the person with the X didn’t come forward, Svan didn’t trust his group anymore. Therefore, after the group sneaked past a guard, Svan decided to blow up both the car with his team and the ship. Svan and his team split up, and just as the car’s bomb was going to explode, they returned to Svan because they were caught. This led to all of them getting blown up.

So Svan quickly marks his slip and pretends to be the one who was initially chosen. He explains the specifics of their plan: while he will be near the ship, the others will fake a car accident to draw some guards which will allow Svan to get in. Their car is stopped by the State Guard who realizes that Svan is the reason the state of danger was declared. Svan kills the guard and hides the body. He takes one bomb and leaves another one in the car, hoping that the explosion will draw enough attention and punish the five people he now considers fearful traitors. Before the car takes off, Ingra kisses Svan. He waits near the ship fumbling with his slip and wondering who the coward was. Suddenly, he hears the car is driving back. Ingra screams that they were chased, but got away and came back for Svan. He starts running from the car, realizing the bomb inside it is supposed to detonate. The explosion wave knocks him out. Later, he wakes up near a surgeon, who calmly declares that Svan will soon die from the wounds, and shocked Lowry. The surgeon is confused by a paper slip with a cross marked on both sides he found clenched in Svan’s hand.

The Officer of the Deck on the Earth spaceship reports to The Executive Officer about a pathetic underground group of dissidents who spread the rumor that immigrants will kill the indigenous Venusians, descendants of the first expedition. During their arrogant conversation, the ship receives news of an attempted attack.\n\tAn underground organization controlled by an indigenous Venusian, Svan, overhears the ship's delegation's conversation about their contemptuous attitude towards the natives. Svan is determined not to let the Earth colonizers leave Venus and destroy the ship before its departure. The council informs the Venusians that only they had the right to decide the course of action. The underground organization agrees that if the Earth ship returned, it would mean disaster for Venus. Therefore, it should not return. Svan plans to sneak aboard at night and attach the Atomit magnetic time bomb to the ship. However, the commander faces the problem of betrayal, indecision, and cowardice among his renegade team. Svan suggests that the operation draws lots to decide who will be honored to perform the most critical part of the plan - the attachment of the bomb. He draws a small cross on one of the random papers in the bowl for the draw. After distributing the pieces of paper, Svan realizes that none of the team members agrees to reveal the brave one, fulfilling his duty to the people of Venus. The current political situation scares the six conspirators to attempt their expedition. After a fight with the guard, Svan and his team successfully make their way to the ship, but a second bomb turns out to be in Svan's possession and put into the car of his subordinates. Not only does Svan plan to explode the colonizers' ship, but also to take out revenge on his crew. As soon as he thinks of killing two birds with one stone: the Earth colonizers and five traitors, one of the team members Ingra, kisses Svan before going on board and wishes him good luck. Svan is thrown into a shudder, realizing that he is making a fatal mistake. As a result of his confusion, both bombs explode: in his pocket and the car of his accomplices. \nDying on the table of an Earth surgeon on the ship he was trying to destroy, Svan overhears a conversation between the Watch assistant Lowry and the doctor.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n This was the endless problem of all spaceship cooks: He had to feed the men tomorrow on what they had eaten today!\n \n\n \n Unable to get out to the ballgame and a long way off from the girls,\n men on ships think about, talk about, bitch about their food. It's\n true that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion\n can never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a\n challenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts\n that a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list.\n \n In the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing\n seals, for example, the fo'c's'le hands called themselves Lobscousers,\n celebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The\n Limey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into\n his diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age\n only as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen\n are called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the\n road to the larger Space without.\n \n Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in\n history—whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis\n to the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with\n cross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire—he is referred to the\n hundred-and-first chapter of Moby Dick , a book spooled in the\n amusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that\n no Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more\n than a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of\n Leyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a\n man condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.\n \n The Pequod's crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won\n their war on canned pork and beans. The Triton made her underwater\n periplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and\n concentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the\n skies, a decline set in.\n \n The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent\n food. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings\n from aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the\n groundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes.\n \n \n\n \n Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\n through a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\n exordium of Isaiah 36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\n what was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.\n \n The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\n offal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\n spacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\n Slimeheads remember the H. M. S. Ajax fiasco, for example, in which a\n galleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\n shielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\n the Ajax in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\n of the Benjo Maru incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\n his algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing Saccharomycodes yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\n Piano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\n the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\n bite he ate to a superior grade of sake . And for a third footnote to\n the ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\n Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the Charles Partlow\n Sale .\n \n The Sale blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\n in at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\n the low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\n human period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\n seedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed—these to be planted\n in the maria to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\n aboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\n Surgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\n the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\n Robert Bailey.\n \n Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\n tensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\n dietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\n see that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\n water, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\n This isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\n statement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n \n Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\n compartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the C. P. Sale no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\n work over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\n of metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\n and back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\n protein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\n algae fed us.\n \n All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\n from our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\n and back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\n essential amino acids.\n \n The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\n smell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\n hundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\n wore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\n oxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\n end of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\n glomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\n politicians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\n breed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\n squeamishness.\n \n \n\n \n Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife\n in space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher\n extraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,\n guardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.\n Generally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim\n is the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.\n \n If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties\n of his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann\n was the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do\n so alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have\n done splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart\n was a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet\n Earth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as\n Willy Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a\n Pullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social\n hemorrhoid.\n \n The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.\n It was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey,\n Robert,\" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate\n shipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed haut\n cuisine and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our\n algaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was\n Captain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any\n other name than The Kitchen Cabinet.\n \n Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste\n of synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by\n Chlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano\n and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,\n textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the\n slabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.\n For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of\n the carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,\n\"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun\n in my home country: Mensch ist was er isst. It means, you are what\n you eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this Schweinerei you are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin\n with his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the\n ladder from the dining-cubby.\n \n \n\n \n \"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me.\n \n \"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can\n give his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got\n to live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.\"\n \n \"I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\"\n \n \"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I\n said. \"He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in\n my time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.\"\n \n Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It\n was green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This\n is what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into\n its bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,\n we'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\"\n \n \"You'll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous\n death of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up\n the good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.\"\n \n Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye\n from Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook\n waved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I'm thinking about\n tomorrow's menu.\"\n \n The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the\n next day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed\n with something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of\n burnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only\n guess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and\n drying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine\n heads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The pièce de\n résistance was again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal\n mass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only\n faintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had\n been sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It's\n so tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it's really\n steak.\"\n \n Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently\n imploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big\n man's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me\n this pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and\n cycler-salt.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,\" I said. I\n gazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.\n \n \"Yes, I eat it,\" the Captain said, taking and talking through another\n bite. \"But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and\n grasshoppers, to stay alive.\"\n \n \"Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?\" Bailey pleaded.\n \n \"Only good food,\" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised\n algae. He tapped his head with a finger. \"This—the brain that guides\n the ship—cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,\n Belly-Robber?\"\n \n Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. \"Yes, sir. But I really\n don't know what I can do to please you.\"\n \n \"You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban Hausfrau with the\n vapors,\" Winkelmann said. \"I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums\n or weeping. Only—can you understand this, so simple?—food that will\n keep my belly content and my brain alive.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British\n term Dumb Insolence.\n \n Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I\n followed him. \"Captain,\" I said, \"you're driving Bailey too hard.\n You're asking him to make bricks without straw.\"\n \n Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. \"You think, Doctor,\n that my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged\n man?\"\n \n \"Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,\" I said.\n \n \"You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,\"\n Winkelmann said. \"Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the\n Pharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of\n Israel would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the\n mother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him\n uncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,\n to improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn\n somehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.\"\n \n \"You're driving him too hard, Sir,\" I said. \"He'll crack.\"\n \n \"Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we\n ground at Brady Station,\" Captain Winkelmann said. \"So much money buys\n many discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.\"\n \n \"Crew morale on the ship....\" I began.\n \n \"That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,\" Captain Winkelmann repeated.\n \n \n\n \n Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical\n path to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate\n the appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned\n by that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at\n mealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. \"Convey my\n compliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of\n the crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would\n cheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius\n acidly called in question again.\n \n I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go\n into Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in\n brilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an ersatz hot\n turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella\n turkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy\n a grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae\n a lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a\n genuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said.\n \n \"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second\n helping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but\n only arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require\n a geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere\n edibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will\n have learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics\n student. That will be all, Bailey.\"\n \n The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of\n Bailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their\n Captain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark\n on an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last\n few days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many\n memories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had\n lost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,\n seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,\n and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our\n Captain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice\n that would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when\n Winkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.\n \n \n\n \n Each man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects\n besides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As\n his rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this\n ration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of\n books, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help\n him while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a\n fact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of\n spices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,\n and a dozen others.\n \n Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards\n interested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien\n to his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd\n exercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance\n to the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.\n To collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come\n aboard their ship mother-naked.\n \n But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects\n baggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon\n mess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet\n on the mysterious box as he sat to eat.\n \n \"What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today,\n Belly-Robber?\" he asked the Cook.\n \n Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd\n had much practice. \"I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,\"\n he said. \"I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the\n texture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?\"\n \n \"I understand,\" Winkelmann growled. \"You intend that your latest mess\n should feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?\"\n \n \"Yes, Sir,\" Bailey said. \"Well, I squeezed the\n steak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special\n seasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal\n oil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out. Voila! I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine\n meat.\"\n \n \"Remarkable, Bailey,\" I said.\n \n \"It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with\n our food,\" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of\n distaste. \"It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I\n never cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils\n the meal.\"\n \n Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of\n the table and tenderly lifted a small \"steak\" onto each of our plates.\n\"Try it,\" he urged the Captain.\n \n \n\n \n Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The\n color was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell\n of fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. \"Not\n too bad, Belly-Robber,\" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed\n his head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A\n kind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a\n more reasonable man. \"But it still needs something ... something,\"\n Winkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.\n\"Aha! I have it!\"\n \n \"Yes, Sir?\" Bailey asked.\n \n \"This, Belly-Robber!\" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and\n ripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed\n the cap. \"Ketchup,\" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's\n masterpiece. \"The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.\"\n Lifting a hunk of the \"steak,\" streaming ketchup, to his mouth,\n Winkelmann chewed. \"Just the thing,\" he smiled.\n \n \"Damn you!\" Bailey shouted.\n \n Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.\n \n \"... Sir,\" Bailey added.\n \n \"That's better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said\n meditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have\n sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a\n bottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\"\n \n \"But, Sir....\" Bailey began.\n \n \"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat\n to the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic\n slops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of\n this sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in\n no condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you\n understand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded.\n \n \"I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,\n slave-driving....\"\n \n \"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are\n insubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\"\n \n \"Captain, you've gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was\n scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.\n \n \"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's\n Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said.\n \n \"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers\n and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\"\n \n \"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said.\n\"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added.\n \n \n\n \n Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him\n to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my\n bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal\n bulkhead. \"You'll have that drink now,\" I said.\n \n \"No, dammit!\" he shouted.\n \n \"Orders,\" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. \"This is\n therapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat\n like water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.\n \n After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. \"Sorry, Doc,\" he said.\n \n \"You've taken more pressure than most men would,\" I said. \"Nothing to\n be ashamed of.\"\n \n \"He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel\n and sauerkraut and Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art out of an algae\n tank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out\n molecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And\n he expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet\n of the Friends of Escoffier!\"\n \n \"Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,\" I said. \"You've worked your\n fingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not\n appreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year\n from now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that\n restaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.\"\n \n \"I hate him,\" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He\n reached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be\n an apt confederate of vis medicatrix naturae , the healing power of\n nature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it\n off. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.\n \n For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in\n horribleness, a pottage or boiled Chlorella vulgaris that looked\n and tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,\n red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as\n though daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the\n disgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, \"Belly-Robber, you're\n improving a little at last.\"\n \n Bailey nodded and smiled. \"Thank you, Sir,\" he said.\n \n I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were\n now strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of\n irony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was\n a price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann\n theory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain\n had pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I\n thought.\n \n Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted\n of salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were\n vehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for\n the decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served\n the algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley\n oblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.\n \n \n\n \n There being only three seats in the Sale's mess compartment, we ate\n our meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to\n supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell\n to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,\n of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss\n of canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the\n first-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"\n \n \"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.\n \n \"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman\n said.\n \n I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric\n warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of\n us with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried\n Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched\n in a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron\n skillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut\n a bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are\n limits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the\n galley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\"\n I said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is\n actually good .\"\n \n \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.\n \n I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but\n this is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;\n you couldn't have done it without him.\"\n \n \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\"\n Bailey asked.\n \n \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our\n Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\n performance out of his Ship's Cook.\"\n \n Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\n \n I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\n He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\n of the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\n spearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll\n have to admit that I do.\"\n \n Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\n plate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "6e0e3a9e14fa4a978efb59fd8789cef4", "response_text": "The story first begins discussing how food is a central topic for men on ships. The Marsmen are called Slimeheads, honoring in their title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that open the road to the wider space without by filling the spaces within. The Ship’s Cook is described to be the most vital man on a spacer because he is the one who turns offal into eatables. There are also instances described where the cooks have messed up and created disasters for fellow crew members, such as poisoning them. Paul Vilanova, the narrator, goes on to tell what happened on the Charles Partlow Sale. The ship is to take a low-energy route and carries various seeds of plantlife. There are the Registry minimum of six men and three officers aboard, including Paul the surgeon, Willy Winkelmann the captain, and Robert Bailey the cook. The cook is responsible for the livelihood of all the men on the ship, and the algae also helped feed the men in a way where they cannot afford the luxury of squeamishness. Although Paul is the surgeon, he rarely lifts a knife in space because his duties are more in line with serving as a morale officer and wailing-wall. Captain Winkelman is described to have a heart of helium ice and is extremely unpopular. Bailey is often his target, but he tries his best as the Ship Cook to feed everybody in a way that makes the algae somewhat appetizing. Paul admits that he does not like the Captain much, but he tells Bailey that his cooking is what keeps the captain retaining his plump figure. Bailey cooks them a luxurious meal the next day, but the captain only criticizes him. Bailey tries to ask what Captain Winkelman wants from him, and even Paul says that he is going to crack from being driven so hard. The Captain tells him that he is simply trying to widen Bailey’s horizons in terms of cooking. Bailey tries to avoid the Captain during meal time after, and Paul believes that he is the finest cook to go into the Hohmann orbit. Even though everybody is impressed by his dishes, Winkelmann still refuses to compliment him despite gaining weight from eating. When Bailey tries to convince the Captain of his food again, Winkelmann takes out a bottle of ketchup to eat with his meal. Bailey is furious, while Paul tries to cheer him up over some fifty cc’s of rye. After the therapeutic drinking, Bailey begins to cook awful looking and tasting dishes. Winkelman, ironically, tells Bailey that he is improving even though the other crew members complain. When Paul goes to visit Bailey again later, one of the crew members exclaims that the cook has managed to make the algae taste similar to real food. Paul tells him that this is the result of the Captain’s continuous pushing; he answers that he does like the Captain when Bailey asks him again.

The story chronicles the importance of food in space, in particular, the trials of the Ship’s Cook in making delectable food out of ship-offal, which all food is made out of. \n\nThe Ship’s Cook, Bailey, is introduced to us as someone who feeds his shipmates by groundside standards. He hides the synthetic and off-putting tastes of the algal repasts with spices like oregano and thyme, and uses his culinary techniques to shape and reuse the offals into mock-meats and other familiar meals. His fellow ship mates are satisfied with the tastes and creativeness of the meals - with none of them losing the typical weight aboard a ship and their Captain Winkelmann, actually, gaining more weight instead. Despite this, the Captain verbalizes his dissatisfaction and criticizes each meal. Every time Bailey ups the ante in the tastes or creativeness of a meal prepared, the Captain’s critique only increases further. The story’s narrator aids the Cook's support and reassures him of the delicious quality of the food he prepares, second to none of the narrator’s past ship experiences. As part of his role in crew morale, the narrator tries to reason with the Captain in driving Bailey too hard, but to no avail. \n\nAt his breaking point, Bailey prepares the ship and the Captain an exquisite steak meal, mimicking its real texture, only to be insulted by the Captain bringing out ketchup and declaring it palpable only with the condiment. Respectfully telling off the Captain, the narrator brings Bailey back to his bunkers and reaches for alcohol as a healing power of nature, again reassuring him and commending him for taking the pressure. The next morning, the crew is served a disgusting pottage of the algae and finally, Bailey receives the Captain’s approval. The narrator is proud, willing to take the bad meals for the rest of the trip in exchange for Bailey overcoming the Captain and gaining his psychic defenses. After a day, the crew mates are rewarded by Bailey’s newest concoction: a barbecued steak that is complimented to actually taste of food and be delicious.

Throughout the story, the Captain continuously berates Bailey for the lack of quality in his cooking, even though Paul and the rest of the ship are really impressed with the food. Bailey is forced to cook with algae, as it allows for long trips and gives men all the necessary nutrients that they need. When the Captain begins to put ketchup on Bailey’s delicacies, he takes this as the last straw and begins to lower the quality of the cooking severely.

The ones that do that are called the spacers. They spend a lot of time in space, and, thus, need to eat a lot. The solution of this future is algae that feed the men and help keep the ship a sustainable system. The narrator of the story is Paul Vilanova, a spacer. Sometime in the past, he traveled to Mars on a ship called The Sale. He was the board surgeon, the captain was Willy Winkelmann - a very unapproachable man. Their cook - the most important person on the ship because he had to apply biochemistry and dietetics to cook nourishing food from Chlorella algae - was called Robert Bailey, he was originally from Ohio. Vilanova describes a very tense relationship between the cook and the captain: Willy Winkelmann, an unpleasant person he was, was always mispronouncing the cook's name and criticizing his dishes. \n\nHe served a three-course dinner and the crew thanked him, but the captain found his food disgusting and left the dinner with a small scandal. Later, Bailey talked to the surgeon about the captain and complained about his insulting remarks. Paul assured him that no one could make Winkelmann happy and that the food was way above average. The next day the captain made an offensive comment about Bailey's cooking abilities again. Paul tried to talk to Winkelmann about his harsh attitude towards Bailey, and the captain said that he believed this attitude would make the cook improvise and experiment more. Paul disagreed but was soon told to leave. Bailey started avoiding the captain but was still called from the kitchen almost every time. The other crew members enjoyed this conflict since it made Bailey cook in a more creative way. One day Paul even learned that instead of taking anything meaningful on the board Winkelmann had just brought a box of ketchup to help him eat the spacers’ food and humiliate Bailey even more. After another offensive monologue from the captain, the cook became angry and started talking back, but Winkelmann quickly excused him and Paul, who had tried to defend Bailey. Later Paul gave the cook some rye and listened to him cursing and insulting the captain. The next morning Bailey cooked something unusually disgusting, and the captain realized he had lost and decided to give the cook a word of praise. Sometime later, Bailey managed to make the best dish he had made so far - the steaks tasted like real food, not the algae. After a small chat, Paul and Bailey both agreed that Winkelmann had significantly contributed to Bailey's success by criticizing his food and driving the cook more eager to prove himself.

She said\n mildly, \"You're late.\"\n \n \"Don't yell at me, I\n feel awful,\" Simon told\n her. He sat down at his desk, passed\n his tongue over his teeth in distaste,\n groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the\n aspirin bottle.\n \n He looked over at Betty and said,\n almost as though reciting, \"What I\n need is a vacation.\"\n \n \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going\n to use for money?\"\n \n \"Providence,\" Simon told her\n whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,\n\"will provide.\"\n \n \"Hm-m-m. But before providing\n vacations it'd be nice if Providence\n turned up a missing jewel deal, say.\n Something where you could deduce\n that actually the ruby ring had gone\n down the drain and was caught in the\n elbow. Something that would net\n about fifty dollars.\"\n \n Simon said, mournful of tone,\n\"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five\n hundred?\"\n \n \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All\n I want is enough to pay me this\n week's salary.\"\n \n \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you\n took this job you said it was the romance\n that appealed to you.\"\n \n \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most\n sleuthing amounted to snooping\n around department stores to check on\n the clerks knocking down.\"\n \n Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now\n it comes.\"\n \n \n \n There was a knock.\n \n Betty bounced up with Olympic\n agility and had the door swinging\n wide before the knocking was quite\n completed.\n \n He was old, little and had bug\n eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His\n suit was cut in the style of yesteryear\n but when a suit costs two or\n three hundred dollars you still retain\n caste whatever the styling.\n \n Simon said unenthusiastically,\n\"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated\n the client's chair. \"Sit down,\n sir.\"\n \n The client fussed himself with\n Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed\n Simon, said finally, \"You know\n my name, that's pretty good. Never\n saw you before in my life. Stop fussing\n with me, young lady. Your ad\n in the phone book says you'll investigate\n anything.\"\n \n \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only\n one exception.\"\n \n \"Excellent. Do you believe in time\n travel?\"\n \n Simon said nothing. Across the\n room, where she had resumed her\n seat, Betty cleared her throat. When\n Simon continued to say nothing she\n ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n \n \"Why?\"\n \n \"Why?\"\n \n \"Yes, why?\"\n \n Betty looked to her boss for assistance.\n None was forthcoming. There\n ought to be some very quick, positive,\n definite answer. She said, \"Well,\n for one thing, paradox. Suppose you\n had a time machine and traveled back\n a hundred years or so and killed your\n own great-grandfather. Then how\n could you ever be born?\"\n \n \"Confound it if I know,\" the little\n fellow growled. \"How?\"\n \n Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,\n what you wanted to see me about.\"\n \n \"I want to hire you to hunt me up\n some time travelers,\" the old boy\n said.\n \n Betty was too far in now to maintain\n her proper role of silent secretary.\n\"Time travelers,\" she said, not\n very intelligently.\n \n The potential client sat more erect,\n obviously with intent to hold the\n floor for a time. He removed the\n pince-nez glasses and pointed them\n at Betty. He said, \"Have you read\n much science fiction, Miss?\"\n \n \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n \n \"Then you'll realize that there are\n a dozen explanations of the paradoxes\n of time travel. Every writer in\n the field worth his salt has explained\n them away. But to get on. It's my\n contention that within a century or\n so man will have solved the problems\n of immortality and eternal youth, and\n it's also my suspicion that he will\n eventually be able to travel in time.\n So convinced am I of these possibilities\n that I am willing to gamble a\n portion of my fortune to investigate\n the presence in our era of such time\n travelers.\"\n \n Simon seemed incapable of carrying\n the ball this morning, so Betty\n said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the\n future has developed time travel why\n don't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n \n Simon put in a word. \"The usual\n explanation, Betty, is that they can't\n afford to allow the space-time continuum\n track to be altered. If, say, a\n time traveler returned to a period of\n twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,\n then all subsequent history would be\n changed. In that case, the time traveler\n himself might never be born. They\n have to tread mighty carefully.\"\n \n Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't\n expect you to be so well informed\n on the subject, young man.\"\n \n Simon shrugged and fumbled\n again with the aspirin bottle.\n \n \n \n Mr. Oyster went on. \"I've been\n considering the matter for some time\n and—\"\n \n Simon held up a hand. \"There's\n no use prolonging this. As I understand\n it, you're an elderly gentleman\n with a considerable fortune and you\n realize that thus far nobody has succeeded\n in taking it with him.\"\n \n Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to\n their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then\n nodded.\n \n Simon said, \"You want to hire me\n to find a time traveler and in some\n manner or other—any manner will\n do—exhort from him the secret of\n eternal life and youth, which you figure\n the future will have discovered.\n You're willing to pony up a part of\n this fortune of yours, if I can deliver\n a bona fide time traveler.\"\n \n \"Right!\"\n \n Betty had been looking from one\n to the other. Now she said, plaintively,\n\"But where are you going to find\n one of these characters—especially if\n they're interested in keeping hid?\"\n \n The old boy was the center again.\n\"I told you I'd been considering it\n for some time. The Oktoberfest ,\n that's where they'd be!\" He seemed\n elated.\n \n Betty and Simon waited.\n \n \"The Oktoberfest ,\" he repeated.\n\"The greatest festival the world has\n ever seen, the carnival, feria , fiesta to beat them all. Every year it's held\n in Munich. Makes the New Orleans\n Mardi gras look like a quilting\n party.\" He began to swing into the\n spirit of his description. \"It originally\n started in celebration of the wedding\n of some local prince a century\n and a half ago and the Bavarians had\n such a bang-up time they've been\n holding it every year since. The\n Munich breweries do up a special\n beer, Marzenbräu they call it, and\n each brewery opens a tremendous tent\n on the fair grounds which will hold\n five thousand customers apiece. Millions\n of liters of beer are put away,\n hundreds of thousands of barbecued\n chickens, a small herd of oxen are\n roasted whole over spits, millions of\n pair of weisswurst , a very special\n sausage, millions upon millions of\n pretzels—\"\n \n \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept\n it. The Oktoberfest is one whale\n of a wingding.\"\n \n \n \n \"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into\n his subject now, \"that's where they'd\n be, places like the Oktoberfest . For\n one thing, a time traveler wouldn't\n be conspicuous. At a festival like this\n somebody with a strange accent, or\n who didn't know exactly how to wear\n his clothes correctly, or was off the\n ordinary in any of a dozen other\n ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could\n be a four-armed space traveler from\n Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous\n at the Oktoberfest . People\n would figure they had D.T.'s.\"\n \n \"But why would a time traveler\n want to go to a—\" Betty began.\n \n \"Why not! What better opportunity\n to study a people than when they\n are in their cups? If you could go\n back a few thousand years, the things\n you would wish to see would be a\n Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites\n of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's\n orgies. You wouldn't want to wander\n up and down the streets of, say,\n Athens while nothing was going on,\n particularly when you might be revealed\n as a suspicious character not\n being able to speak the language, not\n knowing how to wear the clothes and\n not familiar with the city's layout.\"\n He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am,\n you'd have to stick to some great\n event, both for the sake of actual\n interest and for protection against being\n unmasked.\"\n \n The old boy wound it up. \"Well,\n that's the story. What are your rates?\n The Oktoberfest starts on Friday and\n continues for sixteen days. You can\n take the plane to Munich, spend a\n week there and—\"\n \n Simon was shaking his head. \"Not\n interested.\"\n \n As soon as Betty had got her jaw\n back into place, she glared unbelievingly\n at him.\n \n Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.\n\"See here, young man, I realize\n this isn't an ordinary assignment,\n however, as I said, I am willing to\n risk a considerable portion of my\n fortune—\"\n \n \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be\n done.\"\n \n \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"\n Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I\n like the fact that you already seem\n to have some interest and knowledge\n of the matter. I liked the way you\n knew my name when I walked in the\n door; my picture doesn't appear often\n in the papers.\"\n \n \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality\n in his voice.\n \n \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if\n you bring me a time traveler.\"\n \n \"Out of the question,\" Simon\n said.\n \n \"But why ?\" Betty wailed.\n \n \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the\n two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\n you a funny story. It goes like\n this:\"\n \n \n \n I got a thousand dollars from Mr.\n Oyster (Simon began) in the way\n of an advance, and leaving him with\n Betty who was making out a receipt,\n I hustled back to the apartment and\n packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\n anyway, this was a natural. On\n the way to Idlewild I stopped off at\n the Germany Information Offices for\n some tourist literature.\n \n It takes roughly three and a half\n hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\n I spent the time planning the\n fun I was going to have.\n \n It takes roughly seven and a half\n hours from Gander to Shannon and\n I spent that time dreaming up material\n I could put into my reports to\n Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to\n give him some kind of report for his\n money. Time travel yet! What a\n laugh!\n \n Between Shannon and Munich a\n faint suspicion began to simmer in\n my mind. These statistics I read on\n the Oktoberfest in the Munich tourist\n pamphlets. Five million people\n attended annually.\n \n Where did five million people\n come from to attend an overgrown\n festival in comparatively remote\n Southern Germany? The tourist season\n is over before September 21st,\n first day of the gigantic beer bust.\n Nor could the Germans account for\n any such number. Munich itself has\n a population of less than a million,\n counting children.\n \n And those millions of gallons of\n beer, the hundreds of thousands of\n chickens, the herds of oxen. Who\n ponied up all the money for such expenditures?\n How could the average\n German, with his twenty-five dollars\n a week salary?\n \n In Munich there was no hotel\n space available. I went to the Bahnhof\n where they have a hotel service\n and applied. They put my name\n down, pocketed the husky bribe,\n showed me where I could check my\n bag, told me they'd do what they\n could, and to report back in a few\n hours.\n \n I had another suspicious twinge.\n If five million people attended this\n beer bout, how were they accommodated?\n \n The Theresienwiese , the fair\n ground, was only a few blocks\n away. I was stiff from the plane ride\n so I walked.\n \n \n \n There are seven major brewers in\n the Munich area, each of them represented\n by one of the circuslike tents\n that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent\n contained benches and tables for\n about five thousand persons and from\n six to ten thousands pack themselves\n in, competing for room. In the center\n is a tremendous bandstand, the\n musicians all lederhosen clad, the\n music as Bavarian as any to be found\n in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of\n peasant garbed fräuleins darted about\n the tables with quart sized earthenware\n mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,\n kraut and pretzels.\n \n I found a place finally at a table\n which had space for twenty-odd beer\n bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an\n assortment of Germans and foreign\n tourists as could have been dreamed\n up, ranging from a seventy- or\n eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian\n costume, to the bald-headed drunk\n across the table from me.\n \n A desperate waitress bearing six\n mugs of beer in each hand scurried\n past. They call them masses , by the\n way, not mugs. The bald-headed\n character and I both held up a finger\n and she slid two of the masses over\n to us and then hustled on.\n \n \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,\n holding up his mass in toast.\n \n \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before\n sipping, I said, \"You know, the\n tourist pamphlets say this stuff is\n eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.\n No beer is that strong.\" I took a long\n pull.\n \n He looked at me, waiting.\n \n I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n \n A mass or two apiece later he looked\n carefully at the name engraved on\n his earthenware mug. \"Löwenbräu,\"\n he said. He took a small notebook\n from his pocket and a pencil, noted\n down the word and returned the\n things.\n \n \"That's a queer looking pencil you\n have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n \n \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.\n Shouldn't have said that.\"\n \n I had never heard of the brand so\n I skipped it.\n \n \"Next is the Hofbräu,\" he said.\n \n \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation\n didn't seem to hang together very\n well.\n \n \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All\n my life I've been wanting to go back\n to an Oktoberfest and sample every\n one of the seven brands of the best\n beer the world has ever known. I'm\n only as far as Löwenbräu. I'm afraid\n I'll never make it.\"\n \n I finished my mass . \"I'll help\n you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.\n Name is Simon.\"\n \n \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you\n help?\"\n \n \"I'm still fresh—comparatively.\n I'll navigate you around. There are\n seven beer tents. How many have you\n got through, so far?\"\n \n \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth\n said.\n \n I looked at him. \"It's going to be\n a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got\n a nice edge on.\"\n \n Outside, as we made our way to\n the next tent, the fair looked like\n every big State-Fair ever seen, except\n it was bigger. Games, souvenir\n stands, sausage stands, rides, side\n shows, and people, people, people.\n \n The Hofbräu tent was as overflowing\n as the last but we managed to\n find two seats.\n \n The band was blaring, and five\n thousand half-swacked voices were\n roaring accompaniment.\n \n \n In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!\n \n\n Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!\n \n \n \n At the G'sufa everybody upped\n with the mugs and drank each other's\n health.\n \n \"This is what I call a real beer\n bust,\" I said approvingly.\n \n Arth was waving to a waitress. As\n in the Löwenbräu tent, a full quart\n was the smallest amount obtainable.\n \n A beer later I said, \"I don't know\n if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n \n \"Make what?\"\n \n \"All seven tents.\"\n \n \"Oh.\"\n \n A waitress was on her way by,\n mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured\n to her for refills.\n \n \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I\n asked him, in the way of making\n conversation.\n \n \"2183.\"\n \n \"2183 where?\"\n \n He looked at me, closing one eye\n to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,\n2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n \n \"New Albuquerque? Where's\n that?\"\n \n Arth thought about it. Took another\n long pull at the beer. \"Right\n across the way from old Albuquerque,\"\n he said finally. \"Maybe we\n ought to be getting on to the\n Pschorrbräu tent.\"\n \n \"Maybe we ought to eat something\n first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel\n this. We could get some of that barbecued\n ox.\"\n \n Arth closed his eyes in pain.\n\"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly\n eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n \n \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"\n I said.\n \n \"There's supposed to be considerable\n nourishment in beer.\"\n \n That made sense. I yelled, \" Fräulein!\n Zwei neu bier! \"\n \n \n \n Somewhere along in here the fog\n rolled in. When it rolled out again,\n I found myself closing one eye the\n better to read the lettering on my\n earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbräu.\n Somehow we'd evidently\n navigated from one tent to another.\n \n Arth was saying, \"Where's your\n hotel?\"\n \n That seemed like a good question.\n I thought about it for a while. Finally\n I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's\n jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.\n I don't think we'll ever make\n it, Arth. How many we got to\n go?\"\n \n \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can\n come home with me.\"\n \n We drank to that and the fog rolled\n in again.\n \n When the fog rolled out, it was\n daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.\n I was sprawled, complete with\n clothes, on one of twin beds. On the\n other bed, also completely clothed,\n was Arth.\n \n That sun was too much. I stumbled\n up from the bed, staggered to\n the window and fumbled around for\n a blind or curtain. There was none.\n \n Behind me a voice said in horror,\n\"Who ... how ... oh, Wodo ,\n where'd you come from?\"\n \n I got a quick impression, looking\n out the window, that the Germans\n were certainly the most modern, futuristic\n people in the world. But I\n couldn't stand the light. \"Where's\n the shade,\" I moaned.\n \n Arth did something and the window\n went opaque.\n \n \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.\n\"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd\n appreciate it.\"\n \n Arth was sitting on the edge of\n the bed holding his bald head in his\n hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.\n\"You didn't have a hotel.\n What a stupidity. I'll be phased.\n Phased all the way down.\"\n \n \"You haven't got a handful of\n aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n \n \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering\n erect and heading for what\n undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay\n where you are. Don't move. Don't\n touch anything.\"\n \n \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.\n\"I'm clean. I won't mess up the\n place. All I've got is a hangover, not\n lice.\"\n \n Arth was gone. He came back in\n two or three minutes, box of pills in\n hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n \n I took the pill, followed it with a\n glass of water.\n \n \n \n And went out like a light.\n \n Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want\n another mass ?\"\n \n The band was blaring, and five\n thousand half-swacked voices were\n roaring accompaniment.\n \n \n In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!\n \n\n Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!\n \n \n \n At the G'sufa everybody upped\n with their king-size mugs and drank\n each other's health.\n \n My head was killing me. \"This is\n where I came in, or something,\" I\n groaned.\n \n Arth said, \"That was last night.\"\n He looked at me over the rim of his\n beer mug.\n \n Something, somewhere, was\n wrong. But I didn't care. I finished\n my mass and then remembered. \"I've\n got to get my bag. Oh, my head.\n Where did we spend last night?\"\n \n Arth said, and his voice sounded\n cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n \n \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I\n feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.\n I've got to go to the Bahnhof and\n get my luggage.\"\n \n Arth didn't put up an argument\n on that. We said good-by and I could\n feel him watching after me as I pushed\n through the tables on the way\n out.\n \n At the Bahnhof they could do me\n no good. There were no hotel rooms\n available in Munich. The head was\n getting worse by the minute. The\n fact that they'd somehow managed\n to lose my bag didn't help. I worked\n on that project for at least a couple\n of hours. Not only wasn't the bag\n at the luggage checking station, but\n the attendant there evidently couldn't\n make heads nor tails of the check\n receipt. He didn't speak English and\n my high school German was inadequate,\n especially accompanied by a\n blockbusting hangover.\n \n I didn't get anywhere tearing my\n hair and complaining from one end\n of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew\n a blank on the bag.\n \n And the head was getting worse\n by the minute. I was bleeding to\n death through the eyes and instead\n of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.\n Believe me, nobody should drink\n a gallon or more of Marzenbräu.\n \n \n \n I decided the hell with it. I took\n a cab to the airport, presented my return\n ticket, told them I wanted to\n leave on the first obtainable plane to\n New York. I'd spent two days at the Oktoberfest , and I'd had it.\n \n I got more guff there. Something\n was wrong with the ticket, wrong\n date or some such. But they fixed\n that up. I never was clear on what\n was fouled up, some clerk's error,\n evidently.\n \n The trip back was as uninteresting\n as the one over. As the hangover began\n to wear off—a little—I was almost\n sorry I hadn't been able to stay.\n If I'd only been able to get a room I would have stayed, I told myself.\n \n From Idlewild, I came directly to\n the office rather than going to my\n apartment. I figured I might as well\n check in with Betty.\n \n I opened the door and there I\n found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair\n he had been occupying four—or was\n it five—days before when I'd left.\n I'd lost track of the time.\n \n I said to him, \"Glad you're here,\n sir. I can report. Ah, what was it\n you came for? Impatient to hear if\n I'd had any results?\" My mind was\n spinning like a whirling dervish in\n a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of\n his money and had nothing I could\n think of to show for it; nothing but\n the last stages of a grand-daddy\n hangover.\n \n \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.\n\"I'm merely waiting for your girl to\n make out my receipt. I thought you\n had already left.\"\n \n \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty\n said.\n \n There was suddenly a double dip\n of ice cream in my stomach. I walked\n over to my desk and looked down at\n the calendar.\n \n Mr. Oyster was saying something\n to the effect that if I didn't leave today,\n it would have to be tomorrow,\n that he hadn't ponied up that thousand\n dollars advance for anything\n less than immediate service. Stuffing\n his receipt in his wallet, he fussed\n his way out the door.\n \n I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose\n you haven't changed this calendar\n since I left.\"\n \n Betty said, \"What's the matter\n with you? You look funny. How did\n your clothes get so mussed? You tore\n the top sheet off that calendar yourself,\n not half an hour ago, just before\n this marble-missing client came\n in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time\n travelers yet.\"\n \n I tried just once more. \"Uh, when\n did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n \n \"Never saw him before in my\n life,\" she said. \"Not until he came\n in this morning.\"\n \n \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n \n While Betty stared at me as though\n it was me that needed candling by a\n head shrinker preparatory to being\n sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished\n in my pocket for my wallet, counted\n the contents and winced at the\n pathetic remains of the thousand.\n I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,\n how long ago did I go out that door—on\n the way to the airport?\"\n \n \"You've been acting sick all morning.\n You went out that door about\n ten minutes ago, were gone about\n three minutes, and then came back.\"\n \n \n \n \"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting\n Simon's story), \"did you\n say this was supposed to be amusing,\n young man? I don't find it so. In\n fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n \n Simon shrugged, put one hand to\n his forehead and said, \"That's only\n the first chapter. There are two\n more.\"\n \n \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr.\n Oyster said. \"I suppose your point\n was to show me how ridiculous the\n whole idea actually is. Very well,\n you've done it. Confound it. However,\n I suppose your time, even when\n spent in this manner, has some value.\n Here is fifty dollars. And good day,\n sir!\"\n \n He slammed the door after him\n as he left.\n \n Simon winced at the noise, took\n the aspirin bottle from its drawer,\n took two, washed them down with\n water from the desk carafe.\n \n Betty looked at him admiringly.\n Came to her feet, crossed over and\n took up the fifty dollars. \"Week's\n wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's\n one way of taking care of a crackpot.\n But I'm surprised you didn't\n take his money and enjoy that vacation\n you've been yearning about.\"\n \n \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three\n times.\"\n \n Betty stared at him. \"You mean—\"\n \n Simon nodded, miserably.\n \n She said, \"But Simon . Fifty thousand\n dollars bonus. If that story was\n true, you should have gone back\n again to Munich. If there was one\n time traveler, there might have\n been—\"\n \n \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said\n bitterly, \"I went back there three\n times. There were hundreds of them.\n Probably thousands.\" He took a deep\n breath. \"Listen, we're just going to\n have to forget about it. They're not\n going to stand for the space-time\n continuum track being altered. If\n something comes up that looks like\n it might result in the track being\n changed, they set you right back at\n the beginning and let things start—for\n you—all over again. They just\n can't allow anything to come back\n from the future and change the\n past.\"\n \n \"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly\n furious at him, \"you've given up!\n Why this is the biggest thing— Why\n the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.\n The future! Just think!\"\n \n Simon said wearily, \"There's just\n one thing you can bring back with\n you from the future, a hangover compounded\n of a gallon or so of Marzenbräu.\n What's more you can pile\n one on top of the other, and another\n on top of that!\"\n \n He shuddered. \"If you think I'm\n going to take another crack at this\n merry-go-round and pile a fourth\n hangover on the three I'm already\n nursing, all at once, you can think\n again.\"\n \n \n THE END", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "8e681a5a47cd4fbbaca3dde623a264ed", "response_text": "Simon goes to his desk as Betty remarks that he is late.

Insisting that time travel is possible and real, with all the paradoxes explained away, Mr. Oyster passionately hypothesizes that time travelers often congregate at events like Oktoberfest and propose for Simon and Betty to attend the festival and nab a time traveler.

When he arrived at the festival, Simon found an available space in a brewers tent. He sat down across a bald-headed man who appeared to be noting down the various beers being tried.

Since the events were repeated three times, Simon’s refusal now changes the flow of events in the near future to avoid a fourth hangover. Even though Mr. Oyster leaves angrily, Simon’s story serves as a true report of time traveling and fulfills Mr. Oyster’s request.

In fact, we can see from the interactions between Simon and Arth that time travelers will do whatever it takes to reset the timeline and prevent the space-time continuum from being threatened. It is clear through Simon’s repeat experiences with the same meeting, same day, and same hangover that Simon had investigated a little too closely to the time travelers, and as a consequence, returned back to his office on a reset day, with only his hangover and change from the initial thousand dollars as the only witness to the alternate reality. \n"}, {"worker_id": "111", "uid": "854a8a7afac244c19e839bdfd0001b97", "response_text": "Simon’s story begins simply as a story of a trip to Germany to the Oktoberfest.

LEE\n \n Illustrated by DILLON\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine October 1960. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n The weatherman was always right: Temperature, 59; humidity, 47%; occasional light showers—but of what?\n \n\n \n The pockets of Mr. Humphrey Fownes were being picked outrageously.\n \n It was a splendid day. The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, the humidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball in a cloudless blue sky.\n \n His pockets were picked eleven times.\n \n It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was a masterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was Humphrey Fownes' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. He was strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses, one after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions. But he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject to begin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking so deeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too many people were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum Dome Conditions (a crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%) when a bogus postman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In the confusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postman rifled Fownes's handkerchief and inside jacket pockets.\n \n \n\n \n He was still thinking about temperature and humidity when a pretty girl happened along with something in her eye. They collided. She got his right and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence. The sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time. He should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in a heated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied his rear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of the handkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of put and take—the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea he was playing.\n \n There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass.\n \n It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist, hitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings of a celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-light fragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Dome weevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed the huge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing.\n \n Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass still intrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humidity that was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was this rather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tight surveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of getting his fingerprints off the postman's bag, and which photographed, X-rayed and chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returning them. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled a five-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster of Paris. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight and handedness behind.\n \n By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier complete with photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in an orange patrol car parked down the street.\n \n \n\n \n Lanfierre had undoubtedly been affected by his job.\n \n Sitting behind the wheel of the orange car, he watched Humphrey Fownes approach with a distinct feeling of admiration, although it was an odd, objective kind of admiration, clinical in nature. It was similar to that of a pathologist observing for the first time a new and particularly virulent strain of pneumococcus under his microscope.\n \n Lanfierre's job was to ferret out aberration. It couldn't be tolerated within the confines of a dome. Conformity had become more than a social force; it was a physical necessity. And, after years of working at it, Lanfierre had become an admirer of eccentricity. He came to see that genuine quirks were rare and, as time went on, due partly to his own small efforts, rarer.\n \n Fownes was a masterpiece of queerness. He was utterly inexplicable. Lanfierre was almost proud of Humphrey Fownes.\n \n \"Sometimes his house shakes ,\" Lanfierre said.\n \n \"House shakes,\" Lieutenant MacBride wrote in his notebook. Then he stopped and frowned. He reread what he'd just written.\n \n \"You heard right. The house shakes ,\" Lanfierre said, savoring it.\n \n MacBride looked at the Fownes house through the magnifying glass of the windshield. \"Like from ... side to side ?\" he asked in a somewhat patronizing tone of voice.\n \n \"And up and down.\"\n \n MacBride returned the notebook to the breast pocket of his orange uniform. \"Go on,\" he said, amused. \"It sounds interesting.\" He tossed the dossier carelessly on the back seat.\n \n Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the wheel, affronted. The cynical MacBride couldn't really appreciate fine aberrations. In some ways MacBride was a barbarian. Lanfierre had held out on Fownes for months. He had even contrived to engage him in conversation once, a pleasantly absurd, irrational little chat that titillated him for weeks. It was only with the greatest reluctance that he finally mentioned Fownes to MacBride. After years of searching for differences Lanfierre had seen how extraordinarily repetitious people were, echoes really, dimly resounding echoes, each believing itself whole and separate. They spoke in an incessant chatter of cliches, and their actions were unbelievably trite.\n \n Then a fine robust freak came along and the others—the echoes—refused to believe it. The lieutenant was probably on the point of suggesting a vacation.\n \n \"Why don't you take a vacation?\" Lieutenant MacBride suggested.\n \n \"It's like this, MacBride. Do you know what a wind is? A breeze? A zephyr?\"\n \n \"I've heard some.\"\n \n \"They say there are mountain-tops where winds blow all the time. Strong winds, MacBride. Winds like you and I can't imagine. And if there was a house sitting on such a mountain and if winds did blow, it would shake exactly the way that one does. Sometimes I get the feeling the whole place is going to slide off its foundation and go sailing down the avenue.\"\n \n \n\n \n Lieutenant MacBride pursed his lips.\n \n \"I'll tell you something else,\" Lanfierre went on. \"The windows all close at the same time. You'll be watching and all of a sudden every single window in the place will drop to its sill.\" Lanfierre leaned back in the seat, his eyes still on the house. \"Sometimes I think there's a whole crowd of people in there waiting for a signal—as if they all had something important to say but had to close the windows first so no one could hear. Why else close the windows in a domed city? And then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into conversation—and that's why the house shakes.\"\n \n MacBride whistled.\n \n \"No, I don't need a vacation.\"\n \n A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the windshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel.\n \n \"No, you don't need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You're starting to see flying houses, hear loud babbling voices. You've got winds in your brain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigue, zephyrs of irrationality—\"\n \n At that moment, all at once, every last window in the house slammed shut.\n \n The street was deserted and quiet, not a movement, not a sound. MacBride and Lanfierre both leaned forward, as if waiting for the ghostly babble of voices to commence.\n \n The house began to shake.\n \n It rocked from side to side, it pitched forward and back, it yawed and dipped and twisted, straining at the mooring of its foundation. The house could have been preparing to take off and sail down the....\n \n MacBride looked at Lanfierre and Lanfierre looked at MacBride and then they both looked back at the dancing house.\n \n \"And the water ,\" Lanfierre said. \"The water he uses! He could be the thirstiest and cleanest man in the city. He could have a whole family of thirsty and clean kids, and he still wouldn't need all that water.\"\n \n The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages now in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did you see what he carries in his pockets?\"\n \n \"And compasses won't work on this street.\"\n \n The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed.\n \n He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It expressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got neurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There was something implacable about his sighs.\n \n \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door with a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at the widow's next door and then the library.\"\n \n MacBride's eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he said. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\n \n Lanfierre nodded.\n \n \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\n \n \"I can't wait to see what he's got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured, watching the house with a consuming interest.\n \n They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes widened as the house danced a new step.\n \n \n\n \n Fownes stopped on the porch to brush the plaster of paris off his shoes. He hadn't seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupation of his was also responsible for the dancing house—he simply hadn't noticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. He had a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and the high-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of the house. At least, he called it buffeting; he'd never thought to watch from outside.\n \n He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no room left in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist a draw-pull.\n \n Every window slammed shut.\n \n \"Tight as a kite,\" he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward the closet at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was that right? No, snug as a hug in a rug . He went on, thinking: The old devils.\n \n \n The downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion of wheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-saw that went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had a curious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged from grandfather's clocks and music boxes and they went around in graceful circles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although there was one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. He watched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them for seven o'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.\n \n Outside, the domed city vanished.\n \n It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear, the illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a more satisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion. Looking through the window he saw only a garden.\n \n Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sun setting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which left the smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid a huge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon a garden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.\n \n Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory. And cocktails for two. Blast, he'd never be able to figure that one out! He watched as the moon played, Oh, You Beautiful Doll and the neon roses flashed slowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned on the scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated rose as the moon shifted to People Will Say We're In Love .\n \n \n\n \n He rubbed his chin critically. It seemed all right. A dreamy sunset, an enchanted moon, flowers, scent.\n \n They were all purely speculative of course. He had no idea how a rose really smelled—or looked for that matter. Not to mention a moon. But then, neither did the widow. He'd have to be confident, assertive. Insist on it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realistic romantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icy fingers marching up and down your spine?\n \n His own spine didn't seem to be affected. But then he hadn't read that book on ancient mores and courtship customs.\n \n How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incredibly long and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amount of falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. \"No\" meant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and the circumstances. It could mean yes, it could mean ask me again later on this evening.\n \n He went up the stairs to the bedroom closet and tried the rain-maker, thinking roguishly: Thou shalt not inundate. The risks he was taking! A shower fell gently on the garden and a male chorus began to chant Singing in the Rain . Undiminished, the yellow moon and the red sun continued to be brilliant, although the sun occasionally arced over and demolished several of the neon roses.\n \n The last wheel in the bedroom closet was a rather elegant steering wheel from an old 1995 Studebaker. This was on the bootleg pipe; he gingerly turned it.\n \n Far below in the cellar there was a rumble and then the soft whistle of winds came to him.\n \n He went downstairs to watch out the living room window. This was important; the window had a really fixed attitude about air currents. The neon roses bent and tinkled against each other as the wind rose and the moon shook a trifle as it whispered Cuddle Up a Little Closer .\n \n He watched with folded arms, considering how he would start. My dear Mrs. Deshazaway. Too formal. They'd be looking out at the romantic garden; time to be a bit forward. My very dear Mrs. Deshazaway. No. Contrived. How about a simple, Dear Mrs. Deshazaway . That might be it. I was wondering, seeing as how it's so late, if you wouldn't rather stay over instead of going home....\n \n \n Preoccupied, he hadn't noticed the winds building up, didn't hear the shaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connected to wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they made one gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance as high-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening the Studebaker valve wider and wider....\n \n The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other. The red sun shot off a mass of sparks and then quickly sank out of sight. The moon fell on the garden and rolled ponderously along, crooning When the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day .\n \n The shaking house finally woke him up. He scrambled upstairs to the Studebaker wheel and shut it off.\n \n At the window again, he sighed. Repairs were in order. And it wasn't the first time the winds got out of line.\n \n Why didn't she marry him and save all this bother? He shut it all down and went out the front door, wondering about the rhyme of the months, about stately August and eccentric February and romantic April. April. Its days were thirty and it followed September. And all the rest have thirty-one. What a strange people, the ancients!\n \n He still didn't see the orange car parked down the street.\n \n \n\n \n \"Men are too perishable,\" Mrs. Deshazaway said over dinner. \"For all practical purposes I'm never going to marry again. All my husbands die.\"\n \n \"Would you pass the beets, please?\" Humphrey Fownes said.\n \n She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. \"And don't look at me that way,\" she said. \"I'm not going to marry you and if you want reasons I'll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.\"\n \n The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything passionately—talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately red. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry tinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had never known anyone like her. \"You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,\" she said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for her to be, to explain why she couldn't marry him. \"Do you have any idea what people are saying? They're all saying I'm a cannibal! I rob my husbands of their life force and when they're empty I carry their bodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.\"\n \n \"As long as there are people,\" he said philosophically, \"there'll be talk.\"\n \n \"But it's the air! Why don't they talk about that? The air is stale, I'm positive. It's not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse couldn't stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so healthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily worse for him.\"\n \n \"I don't seem to mind the air.\"\n \n She threw up her hands. \"You'd be the worst of the lot!\" She left the table, rustling and tinkling about the room. \"I can just hear them. Try some of the asparagus. Five. That's what they'd say. That woman did it again. And the plain fact is I don't want you on my record.\"\n \n \"Really,\" Fownes protested. \"I feel splendid. Never better.\"\n \n He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his shoulders. \"And what about those very elaborate plans you've been making to seduce me?\"\n \n Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork.\n \n \"Don't you think they'll find out? I found out and you can bet they will. It's my fault, I guess. I talk too much. And I don't always tell the truth. To be completely honest with you, Mr. Fownes, it wasn't the old customs at all standing between us, it was air. I can't have another man die on me, it's bad for my self-esteem. And now you've gone and done something good and criminal, something peculiar.\"\n \n \n\n \n Fownes put his fork down. \"Dear Mrs. Deshazaway,\" he started to say.\n \n \"And of course when they do find out and they ask you why, Mr. Fownes, you'll tell them. No, no heroics, please! When they ask a man a question he always answers and you will too. You'll tell them I wanted to be courted and when they hear that they'll be around to ask me a few questions. You see, we're both a bit queer.\"\n \n \"I hadn't thought of that,\" Fownes said quietly.\n \n \"Oh, it doesn't really matter. I'll join Andrew, Curt, Norman—\"\n \n \"That won't be necessary,\" Fownes said with unusual force. \"With all due respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well state here and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.\"\n \n \"But my dear Mr. Fownes,\" she said, leaning across the table. \"We're lost, you and I.\"\n \n \"Not if we could leave the dome,\" Fownes said quietly.\n \n \"That's impossible! How?\"\n \n In no hurry, now that he had the widow's complete attention, Fownes leaned across the table and whispered: \"Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway? Space? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has no control whatever? Where the wind blows across prairies ; or is it the other way around? No matter. How would you like that , Mrs. Deshazaway?\"\n \n Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her two hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said.\n \n \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway. And June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is supposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond the dome.\"\n \n \"I see.\"\n \n \" And ,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say that somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight, the sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it's vernal and that's when it roams the Open Country where geigers no longer scintillate.\"\n \n \" My. \" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came back to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us outside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays warm long enough for his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ... you may call me Agnes.\"\n \n \n\n \n When Humphrey Fownes stepped out of the widow's house, there was a look of such intense abstraction on his features that Lanfierre felt a wistful desire to get out of the car and walk along with the man. It would be such a deliciously insane experience. (\"April has thirty days,\" Fownes mumbled, passing them, \"because thirty is the largest number such that all smaller numbers not having a common divisor with it are primes .\" MacBride frowned and added it to the dossier. Lanfierre sighed.)\n \n Pinning his hopes on the Movement, Fownes went straight to the library several blocks away, a shattered depressing place given over to government publications and censored old books with holes in them. It was used so infrequently that the Movement was able to meet there undisturbed. The librarian was a yellowed, dog-eared woman of eighty. She spent her days reading ancient library cards and, like the books around her, had been rendered by time's own censor into near unintelligibility.\n \n \"Here's one,\" she said to him as he entered. \" Gulliver's Travels. Loaned to John Wesley Davidson on March 14, 1979 for five days. What do you make of it?\"\n \n In the litter of books and cards and dried out ink pads that surrounded the librarian, Fownes noticed a torn dust jacket with a curious illustration. \"What's that?\" he said.\n \n \"A twister,\" she replied quickly. \"Now listen to this . Seven years later on March 21, 1986, Ella Marshall Davidson took out the same book. What do you make of that ?\"\n \n \"I'd say,\" Humphrey Fownes said, \"that he ... that he recommended it to her, that one day they met in the street and he told her about this book and then they ... they went to the library together and she borrowed it and eventually, why eventually they got married.\"\n \n \"Hah! They were brother and sister!\" the librarian shouted in her parched voice, her old buckram eyes laughing with cunning.\n \n Fownes smiled weakly and looked again at the dust jacket. The twister was unquestionably a meteorological phenomenon. It spun ominously, like a malevolent top, and coursed the countryside destructively, carrying a Dorothy to an Oz. He couldn't help wondering if twisters did anything to feminine pulses, if they could possibly be a part of a moonlit night, with cocktails and roses. He absently stuffed the dust jacket in his pocket and went on into the other rooms, the librarian mumbling after him: \"Edna Murdoch Featherstone, April 21, 1991,\" as though reading inscriptions on a tombstone.\n \n \n\n \n The Movement met in what had been the children's room, where unpaid ladies of the afternoon had once upon a time read stories to other people's offspring. The members sat around at the miniature tables looking oddly like giants fled from their fairy tales, protesting.\n \n \"Where did the old society fail?\" the leader was demanding of them. He stood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane. He glanced around at the group almost complacently, and waited as Humphrey Fownes squeezed into an empty chair. \"We live in a dome,\" the leader said, \"for lack of something. An invention! What is the one thing that the great technological societies before ours could not invent, notwithstanding their various giant brains, electronic and otherwise?\"\n \n Fownes was the kind of man who never answered a rhetorical question. He waited, uncomfortable in the tight chair, while the others struggled with this problem in revolutionary dialectics.\n \n \" A sound foreign policy ,\" the leader said, aware that no one else had obtained the insight. \"If a sound foreign policy can't be created the only alternative is not to have any foreign policy at all. Thus the movement into domes began— by common consent of the governments . This is known as self-containment.\"\n \n Dialectically out in left field, Humphrey Fownes waited for a lull in the ensuing discussion and then politely inquired how it might be arranged for him to get out.\n \n \"Out?\" the leader said, frowning. \"Out? Out where?\"\n \n \"Outside the dome.\"\n \n \"Oh. All in good time, my friend. One day we shall all pick up and leave.\"\n \n \"And that day I'll await impatiently,\" Fownes replied with marvelous tact, \"because it will be lonely out there for the two of us. My future wife and I have to leave now .\"\n \n \"Nonsense. Ridiculous! You have to be prepared for the Open Country. You can't just up and leave, it would be suicide, Fownes. And dialectically very poor.\"\n \n \"Then you have discussed preparations, the practical necessities of life in the Open Country. Food, clothing, a weapon perhaps? What else? Have I left anything out?\"\n \n The leader sighed. \"The gentleman wants to know if he's left anything out,\" he said to the group.\n \n Fownes looked around at them, at some dozen pained expressions.\n \n \"Tell the man what he's forgotten,\" the leader said, walking to the far window and turning his back quite pointedly on them.\n \n Everyone spoke at the same moment. \" A sound foreign policy ,\" they all said, it being almost too obvious for words.\n \n \n\n \n On his way out the librarian shouted at him: \" A Tale of a Tub , thirty-five years overdue!\" She was calculating the fine as he closed the door.\n \n Humphrey Fownes' preoccupation finally came to an end when he was one block away from his house. It was then that he realized something unusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security police was parked at his front door. And something else was happening too.\n \n His house was dancing.\n \n It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one's residence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sight that for the moment he didn't give a thought to what might be causing it. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing its own independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immense curiosity.\n \n The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch.\n \n From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched as his favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast of cold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. A wild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs, suits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofa cushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging an old, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of his ancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room.\n \n He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toying with his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on his cheeks. He got hit by a shoe.\n \n As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played over his face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room.\n \n \"Help!\" Lieutenant MacBride called.\n \n Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on his dripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in the distance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly.\n \n \" Winds ,\" he said in a whisper.\n \n \"What's happening?\" MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa.\n \n \" March winds,\" he said.\n \n \"What?!\"\n \n \"April showers!\"\n \n The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride's lost voice emerged from the blackness of the living room. \"These are not Optimum Dome Conditions!\" the voice wailed. \"The temperature is not 59 degrees. The humidity is not 47%!\"\n \n \n\n \n Fownes held his face up to let the rain fall on it. \"Moonlight!\" he shouted. \"Roses! My soul for a cocktail for two!\" He grasped the doorway to keep from being blown out of the house.\n \n \"Are you going to make it stop or aren't you!\" MacBride yelled.\n \n \"You'll have to tell me what you did first!\"\n \n \"I told him not to touch that wheel! Lanfierre. He's in the upstairs bedroom!\"\n \n When he heard this Fownes plunged into the house and fought his way up the stairs. He found Lanfierre standing outside the bedroom with a wheel in his hand.\n \n \n\n \n \"What have I done?\" Lanfierre asked in the monotone of shock.\n \n Fownes took the wheel. It was off a 1995 Studebaker.\n \n \"I'm not sure what's going to come of this,\" he said to Lanfierre with an astonishing amount of objectivity, \"but the entire dome air supply is now coming through my bedroom.\"\n \n The wind screamed.\n \n \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\n \n \"Not any more there isn't.\"\n \n They started down the stairs carefully, but the wind caught them and they quickly reached the bottom in a wet heap.\n \n Recruiting Lieutenant MacBride from behind his sofa, the men carefully edged out of the house and forced the front door shut.\n \n The wind died. The fog dispersed. They stood dripping in the Optimum Dome Conditions of the bright avenue.\n \n \"I never figured on this ,\" Lanfierre said, shaking his head.\n \n With the front door closed the wind quickly built up inside the house. They could see the furnishing whirl past the windows. The house did a wild, elated jig.\n \n \"What kind of a place is this?\" MacBride said, his courage beginning to return. He took out his notebook but it was a soggy mess. He tossed it away.\n \n \"Sure, he was different ,\" Lanfierre murmured. \"I knew that much.\"\n \n When the roof blew off they weren't really surprised. With a certain amount of equanimity they watched it lift off almost gracefully, standing on end for a moment before toppling to the ground. It was strangely slow motion, as was the black twirling cloud that now rose out of the master bedroom, spewing shorts and socks and cases every which way.\n \n \" Now what?\" MacBride said, thoroughly exasperated, as this strange black cloud began to accelerate, whirling about like some malevolent top....\n \n \n\n \n Humphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he'd found in the library. He held it up and carefully compared the spinning cloud in his bedroom with the illustration. The cloud rose and spun, assuming the identical shape of the illustration.\n \n \"It's a twister,\" he said softly. \"A Kansas twister!\"\n \n \"What,\" MacBride asked, his bravado slipping away again, \"what ... is a twister?\"\n \n The twister roared and moved out of the bedroom, out over the rear of the house toward the side of the dome. \"It says here,\" Fownes shouted over the roaring, \"that Dorothy traveled from Kansas to Oz in a twister and that ... and that Oz is a wonderful and mysterious land beyond the confines of everyday living .\"\n \n MacBride's eyes and mouth were great zeros.\n \n \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\n \n Huge chunks of glass began to fall around them.\n \n \"Fownes!\" MacBride shouted. \"This is a direct order! Make it go back!\"\n \n But Fownes had already begun to run on toward the next house, dodging mountainous puffs of glass as he went. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\" he shouted.\n\"Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshazaway!\"\n \n The dome weevils were going berserk trying to keep up with the precipitation. They whirred back and forth at frightful speed, then, emptied of molten glass, rushed to the Trough which they quickly emptied and then rushed about empty-handed. \"Yoo-hoo!\" he yelled, running. The artificial sun vanished behind the mushrooming twister. Optimum temperature collapsed. \"Mrs. Deshazaway! Agnes , will you marry me? Yoo-hoo!\"\n \n Lanfierre and Lieutenant MacBride leaned against their car and waited, dazed.\n \n There was quite a large fall of glass.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "af2277cc377c4fe0a323b1470d434367", "response_text": "Mr. Humphrey Fownes has been pickpocketed eleven times despite the weather being good.

Lanfierre considers MacBride to be a barbarian because he is cynical and cannot appreciate the peculiar nature of Fownes. He goes on to tell him that the windows all close at the same time in the house. MacBride refuses to believe him and tells him to take a rest, but all of the windows close, and the house suddenly begins to shake. They continue to observe the man; Fownes goes into his house and begins to think about his dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway. The house begins to shake more, and he decides that repairs are a must. During his dinner, Mrs. Deshazaway explains how she will never marry again. The widow is a passionate woman, and she passionately tells him he forgot salt on his potatoes during the explanation of why they cannot marry because of the air. When she continues to refuse him, Fownes brings up the idea of leaving the dome city for freedom. She tells him that if they can leave, then she will let him call her by her first name. After the date, he goes to the library, where the old librarian tries to test him with old library cards. The story then cuts to a movement meeting, where the members discuss how the old society failed and the lack of a sound foreign policy. Fownes impatiently explains that he and his future wife must leave now, to which the leader explains that it is impossible because there is no sound foreign policy. When Fownes returns to the house, he finds MacBride in the doorway with dripping hair. MacBride yells that these are not optimum dome conditions, explaining that Lanfierre is in the upstairs bedroom.

Beyond, nose\n high, stood the silver scout ship\n that had brought the advance\n exploratory party of scientists\n and technicians to Waiamea\n three days before. Except for a\n few of the killer robots rolling\n slowly around the camp site on\n their quiet treads, there was no\n one about.\n \n \"So, they've finally got those\n things working.\" Alan smiled\n slightly. \"Guess that means I\n owe Pete a bourbon-and-soda\n for sure. Anybody who can\n build a robot that hunts by homing\n in on animals' mind impulses ...\"\n He stepped forward\n just as a roar of blue flame dissolved\n the branches of a tree,\n barely above his head.\n \n Without pausing to think,\n Alan leaped back, and fell\n sprawling over a bush just as\n one of the robots rolled silently\n up from the right, lowering its\n blaster barrel to aim directly at\n his head. Alan froze. \"My God,\n Pete built those things wrong!\"\n \n Suddenly a screeching whirlwind\n of claws and teeth hurled\n itself from the smoldering\n branches and crashed against the\n robot, clawing insanely at the\n antenna and blaster barrel.\n With an awkward jerk the robot\n swung around and fired its blaster,\n completely dissolving the\n lower half of the cat creature\n which had clung across the barrel.\n But the back pressure of the\n cat's body overloaded the discharge\n circuits. The robot started\n to shake, then clicked sharply\n as an overload relay snapped\n and shorted the blaster cells.\n The killer turned and rolled back\n towards the camp, leaving Alan\n alone.\n \n Shakily, Alan crawled a few\n feet back into the undergrowth\n where he could lie and watch the\n camp, but not himself be seen.\n Though visibility didn't make\n any difference to the robots, he\n felt safer, somehow, hidden. He\n knew now what the shooting\n sounds had been and why there\n hadn't been anyone around the\n camp site. A charred blob lying\n in the grass of the clearing confirmed\n his hypothesis. His stomach\n felt sick.\n \n \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\n himself, \"that Pete assembled\n these robots in a batch and then\n activated them all at once, probably\n never living to realize that\n they're tuned to pick up human\n brain waves, too. Damn!\n Damn!\" His eyes blurred and\n he slammed his fist into the soft\n earth.\n \n When he raised his eyes again\n the jungle was perceptibly darker.\n Stealthy rustlings in the\n shadows grew louder with the\n setting sun. Branches snapped\n unaccountably in the trees overhead\n and every now and then\n leaves or a twig fell softly to the\n ground, close to where he lay.\n Reaching into his jacket, Alan\n fingered his pocket blaster. He\n pulled it out and held it in his\n right hand. \"This pop gun\n wouldn't even singe a robot, but\n it just might stop one of those\n pumas.\"\n \n \n They said the blast with your name on it would find\n you anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.\n \n \n Slowly Alan looked around,\n sizing up his situation. Behind\n him the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\n He shuddered. \"Not a\n very healthy spot to spend the\n night. On the other hand, I certainly\n can't get to the camp with\n a pack of mind-activated mechanical\n killers running around.\n If I can just hold out until morning,\n when the big ship arrives ...\n The big ship! Good\n Lord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\n oily sweat punctuated his forehead.\n Peggy, arriving tomorrow\n with the other colonists, the\n wives and kids! The metal killers,\n tuned to blast any living\n flesh, would murder them the\n instant they stepped from the\n ship!\n \n \n \n A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\n he'd married just three weeks\n ago. He still couldn't believe it.\n It was crazy, he supposed, to\n marry a girl and then take off\n for an unknown planet, with her\n to follow, to try to create a home\n in a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\n but Peggy and her green eyes\n that changed color with the\n light, with her soft brown hair,\n and her happy smile, had ended\n thirty years of loneliness and\n had, at last, given him a reason\n for living. \"Not to be killed!\"\n Alan unclenched his fists and\n wiped his palms, bloody where\n his fingernails had dug into the\n flesh.\n \n There was a slight creak above\n him like the protesting of a\n branch too heavily laden. Blaster\n ready, Alan rolled over onto his\n back. In the movement, his elbow\n struck the top of a small\n earthy mound and he was instantly\n engulfed in a swarm of\n locust-like insects that beat disgustingly\n against his eyes and\n mouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\n arms before his face he jumped\n up and backwards, away from\n the bugs. As he did so, a dark\n shapeless thing plopped from\n the trees onto the spot where he\n had been lying stretched out.\n Then, like an ambient fungus,\n it slithered off into the jungle\n undergrowth.\n \n For a split second the jungle\n stood frozen in a brilliant blue\n flash, followed by the sharp report\n of a blaster. Then another.\n Alan whirled, startled. The\n planet's double moon had risen\n and he could see a robot rolling\n slowly across the clearing in his\n general direction, blasting indiscriminately\n at whatever mind\n impulses came within its pickup\n range, birds, insects, anything.\n Six or seven others also left the\n camp headquarters area and\n headed for the jungle, each to a\n slightly different spot.\n \n Apparently the robot hadn't\n sensed him yet, but Alan didn't\n know what the effective range\n of its pickup devices was. He\n began to slide back into the\n jungle. Minutes later, looking\n back he saw that the machine,\n though several hundred yards\n away, had altered its course and\n was now headed directly for\n him.\n \n His stomach tightened. Panic.\n The dank, musty smell of the\n jungle seemed for an instant to\n thicken and choke in his throat.\n Then he thought of the big ship\n landing in the morning, settling\n down slowly after a lonely two-week\n voyage. He thought of a\n brown-haired girl crowding with\n the others to the gangway, eager\n to embrace the new planet, and\n the next instant a charred nothing,\n unrecognizable, the victim\n of a design error or a misplaced\n wire in a machine. \"I have to\n try,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\n try.\" He moved into the blackness.\n \n Powerful as a small tank, the\n killer robot was equipped to\n crush, slash, and burn its way\n through undergrowth. Nevertheless,\n it was slowed by the\n larger trees and the thick, clinging\n vines, and Alan found that\n he could manage to keep ahead\n of it, barely out of blaster range.\n Only, the robot didn't get tired.\n Alan did.\n \n The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\n shadows that wavered\n and danced across the jungle\n floor, hiding debris that tripped\n him and often sent him sprawling\n into the dark. Sharp-edged\n growths tore at his face and\n clothes, and insects attracted by\n the blood matted against his\n pants and shirt. Behind, the robot\n crashed imperturbably after\n him, lighting the night with fitful\n blaster flashes as some\n winged or legged life came within\n its range.\n \n There was movement also, in\n the darkness beside him, scrapings\n and rustlings and an occasional\n low, throaty sound like an\n angry cat. Alan's fingers tensed\n on his pocket blaster. Swift\n shadowy forms moved quickly in\n the shrubs and the growling became\n suddenly louder. He fired\n twice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\n Sharp screams punctuated\n the electric blue discharge as\n a pack of small feline creatures\n leaped snarling and clawing\n back into the night.\n \n \n \n Mentally, Alan tried to figure\n the charge remaining in his blaster.\n There wouldn't be much.\n\"Enough for a few more shots,\n maybe. Why the devil didn't I\n load in fresh cells this morning!\"\n \n The robot crashed on, louder\n now, gaining on the tired human.\n Legs aching and bruised,\n stinging from insect bites, Alan\n tried to force himself to run\n holding his hands in front of\n him like a child in the dark. His\n foot tripped on a barely visible\n insect hill and a winged swarm\n exploded around him. Startled,\n Alan jerked sideways, crashing\n his head against a tree. He\n clutched at the bark for a second,\n dazed, then his knees\n buckled. His blaster fell into the\n shadows.\n \n The robot crashed loudly behind\n him now. Without stopping\n to think, Alan fumbled along the\n ground after his gun, straining\n his eyes in the darkness. He\n found it just a couple of feet to\n one side, against the base of a\n small bush. Just as his fingers\n closed upon the barrel his other\n hand slipped into something\n sticky that splashed over his\n forearm. He screamed in pain\n and leaped back, trying frantically\n to wipe the clinging,\n burning blackness off his arm.\n Patches of black scraped off onto\n branches and vines, but the rest\n spread slowly over his arm as\n agonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\n being ripped away layer by\n layer.\n \n Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\n Alan stumbled forward.\n Sharp muscle spasms shot from\n his shoulder across his back and\n chest. Tears streamed across his\n cheeks.\n \n A blue arc slashed at the trees\n a mere hundred yards behind.\n He screamed at the blast. \"Damn\n you, Pete! Damn your robots!\n Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\n He stepped into emptiness.\n \n Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\n by the water, the pain began to\n fall away. He wanted to lie there\n forever in the dark, cool, wetness.\n For ever, and ever, and ...\n The air thundered.\n \n In the dim light he could see\n the banks of the stream, higher\n than a man, muddy and loose.\n Growing right to the edge of the\n banks, the jungle reached out\n with hairy, disjointed arms as\n if to snag even the dirty little\n stream that passed so timidly\n through its domain.\n \n Alan, lying in the mud of the\n stream bed, felt the earth shake\n as the heavy little robot rolled\n slowly and inexorably towards\n him. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\n he thought, \"in battle\n dress.\" He tried to stand but his\n legs were almost too weak and\n his arm felt numb. \"I'll drown\n him,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown\n the Lord High Executioner.\" He\n laughed. Then his mind cleared.\n He remembered where he was.\n \n \n \n Alan trembled. For the first\n time in his life he understood\n what it was to live, because for\n the first time he realized that he\n would sometime die. In other\n times and circumstances he\n might put it off for a while, for\n months or years, but eventually,\n as now, he would have to watch,\n still and helpless, while death\n came creeping. Then, at thirty,\n Alan became a man.\n \n \"Dammit, no law says I have\n to flame-out now !\" He forced\n himself to rise, forced his legs\n to stand, struggling painfully in\n the shin-deep ooze. He worked\n his way to the bank and began to\n dig frenziedly, chest high, about\n two feet below the edge.\n \n His arm where the black thing\n had been was swollen and tender,\n but he forced his hands to dig,\n dig, dig, cursing and crying to\n hide the pain, and biting his\n lips, ignoring the salty taste of\n blood. The soft earth crumbled\n under his hands until he had a\n small cave about three feet deep\n in the bank. Beyond that the\n soil was held too tightly by the\n roots from above and he had to\n stop.\n \n \n \n The air crackled blue and a\n tree crashed heavily past Alan\n into the stream. Above him on\n the bank, silhouetting against\n the moons, the killer robot stopped\n and its blaster swivelled\n slowly down. Frantically, Alan\n hugged the bank as a shaft of\n pure electricity arced over him,\n sliced into the water, and exploded\n in a cloud of steam. The\n robot shook for a second, its\n blaster muzzle lifted erratically\n and for an instant it seemed almost\n out of control, then it\n quieted and the muzzle again\n pointed down.\n \n Pressing with all his might,\n Alan slid slowly along the bank\n inches at a time, away from the\n machine above. Its muzzle turned\n to follow him but the edge of\n the bank blocked its aim. Grinding\n forward a couple of feet,\n slightly overhanging the bank,\n the robot fired again. For a split\n second Alan seemed engulfed in\n flame; the heat of hell singed his\n head and back, and mud boiled\n in the bank by his arm.\n \n Again the robot trembled. It\n jerked forward a foot and its\n blaster swung slightly away. But\n only for a moment. Then the gun\n swung back again.\n \n Suddenly, as if sensing something\n wrong, its tracks slammed\n into reverse. It stood poised for\n a second, its treads spinning\n crazily as the earth collapsed underneath\n it, where Alan had\n dug, then it fell with a heavy\n splash into the mud, ten feet\n from where Alan stood.\n \n Without hesitation Alan\n threw himself across the blaster\n housing, frantically locking his\n arms around the barrel as the\n robot's treads churned furiously\n in the sticky mud, causing it to\n buck and plunge like a Brahma\n bull. The treads stopped and the\n blaster jerked upwards wrenching\n Alan's arms, then slammed\n down. Then the whole housing\n whirled around and around, tilting\n alternately up and down like\n a steel-skinned water monster\n trying to dislodge a tenacious\n crab, while Alan, arms and legs\n wrapped tightly around the blaster\n barrel and housing, pressed\n fiercely against the robot's metal\n skin.\n \n Slowly, trying to anticipate\n and shift his weight with the\n spinning plunges, Alan worked\n his hand down to his right hip.\n He fumbled for the sheath clipped\n to his belt, found it, and extracted\n a stubby hunting knife.\n Sweat and blood in his eyes,\n hardly able to move on the wildly\n swinging turret, he felt down\n the sides to the thin crack between\n the revolving housing and\n the stationary portion of the robot.\n With a quick prayer he\n jammed in the knife blade—and\n was whipped headlong into the\n mud as the turret literally snapped\n to a stop.\n \n The earth, jungle and moons\n spun in a pinwheeled blur,\n slowed, and settled to their proper\n places. Standing in the sticky,\n sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\n the robot apprehensively. Half\n buried in mud, it stood quiet in\n the shadowy light except for an\n occasional, almost spasmodic\n jerk of its blaster barrel. For\n the first time that night Alan\n allowed himself a slight smile.\n\"A blade in the old gear box,\n eh? How does that feel, boy?\"\n \n He turned. \"Well, I'd better\n get out of here before the knife\n slips or the monster cooks up\n some more tricks with whatever\n it's got for a brain.\" Digging\n little footholds in the soft bank,\n he climbed up and stood once\n again in the rustling jungle\n darkness.\n \n \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\n Pete could cram enough brain\n into one of those things to make\n it hunt and track so perfectly.\"\n He tried to visualize the computing\n circuits needed for the\n operation of its tracking mechanism\n alone. \"There just isn't\n room for the electronics. You'd\n need a computer as big as the\n one at camp headquarters.\"\n \n \n \n In the distance the sky blazed\n as a blaster roared in the jungle.\n Then Alan heard the approaching\n robot, crunching and snapping\n its way through the undergrowth\n like an onrushing forest\n fire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\n They communicate with each\n other! The one I jammed must\n be calling others to help.\"\n \n He began to move along the\n bank, away from the crashing\n sounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\n eyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\n I'll bet anything they're\n automatically controlled by the\n camp computer. That's where\n their brain is!\" He paused.\n\"Then, if that were put out of\n commission ...\" He jerked away\n from the bank and half ran, half\n pulled himself through the undergrowth\n towards the camp.\n \n Trees exploded to his left as\n another robot fired in his direction,\n too far away to be effective\n but churning towards him\n through the blackness.\n \n Alan changed direction slightly\n to follow a line between the\n two robots coming up from\n either side, behind him. His eyes\n were well accustomed to the dark\n now, and he managed to dodge\n most of the shadowy vines and\n branches before they could snag\n or trip him. Even so, he stumbled\n in the wiry underbrush and\n his legs were a mass of stinging\n slashes from ankle to thigh.\n \n The crashing rumble of the\n killer robots shook the night behind\n him, nearer sometimes,\n then falling slightly back, but\n following constantly, more\n unshakable than bloodhounds\n because a man can sometimes cover\n a scent, but no man can stop his\n thoughts. Intermittently, like\n photographers' strobes, blue\n flashes would light the jungle\n about him. Then, for seconds\n afterwards his eyes would see\n dancing streaks of yellow and\n sharp multi-colored pinwheels\n that alternately shrunk and expanded\n as if in a surrealist's\n nightmare. Alan would have to\n pause and squeeze his eyelids\n tight shut before he could see\n again, and the robots would\n move a little closer.\n \n To his right the trees silhouetted\n briefly against brilliance as\n a third robot slowly moved up\n in the distance. Without thinking,\n Alan turned slightly to the\n left, then froze in momentary\n panic. \"I should be at the camp\n now. Damn, what direction am\n I going?\" He tried to think\n back, to visualize the twists and\n turns he'd taken in the jungle.\n\"All I need is to get lost.\"\n \n He pictured the camp computer\n with no one to stop it, automatically\n sending its robots in\n wider and wider forays, slowly\n wiping every trace of life from\n the planet. Technologically advanced\n machines doing the job\n for which they were built, completely,\n thoroughly, without feeling,\n and without human masters\n to separate sense from futility.\n Finally parts would wear out,\n circuits would short, and one by\n one the killers would crunch to\n a halt. A few birds would still\n fly then, but a unique animal\n life, rare in the universe, would\n exist no more. And the bones of\n children, eager girls, and their\n men would also lie, beside a\n rusty hulk, beneath the alien\n sun.\n \n \"Peggy!\"\n \n As if in answer, a tree beside\n him breathed fire, then exploded.\n In the brief flash of the\n blaster shot, Alan saw the steel\n glint of a robot only a hundred\n yards away, much nearer than\n he had thought. \"Thank heaven\n for trees!\" He stepped back, felt\n his foot catch in something,\n clutched futilely at some leaves\n and fell heavily.\n \n Pain danced up his leg as he\n grabbed his ankle. Quickly he\n felt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\n the rotten luck, anyway!\" He\n blinked the pain tears from his\n eyes and looked up—into a robot's\n blaster, jutting out of the\n foliage, thirty yards away.\n \n \n \n Instinctively, in one motion\n Alan grabbed his pocket blaster\n and fired. To his amazement the\n robot jerked back, its gun wobbled\n and started to tilt away.\n Then, getting itself under control,\n it swung back again to face\n Alan. He fired again, and again\n the robot reacted. It seemed familiar\n somehow. Then he remembered\n the robot on the river\n bank, jiggling and swaying for\n seconds after each shot. \"Of\n course!\" He cursed himself for\n missing the obvious. \"The blaster\n static blanks out radio\n transmission from the computer\n for a few seconds. They even do\n it to themselves!\"\n \n Firing intermittently, he\n pulled himself upright and hobbled\n ahead through the bush.\n The robot shook spasmodically\n with each shot, its gun tilted upward\n at an awkward angle.\n \n Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\n stars, real stars brilliant in the\n night sky, and half dragging his\n swelling leg he stumbled out of\n the jungle into the camp clearing.\n Ahead, across fifty yards of\n grass stood the headquarters\n building, housing the robot-controlling\n computer. Still firing at\n short intervals he started across\n the clearing, gritting his teeth\n at every step.\n \n Straining every muscle in\n spite of the agonizing pain, Alan\n forced himself to a limping run\n across the uneven ground, carefully\n avoiding the insect hills\n that jutted up through the grass.\n From the corner of his eye he\n saw another of the robots standing\n shakily in the dark edge of\n the jungle waiting, it seemed,\n for his small blaster to run dry.\n \n \"Be damned! You can't win\n now!\" Alan yelled between blaster\n shots, almost irrational from\n the pain that ripped jaggedly\n through his leg. Then it happened.\n A few feet from the\n building's door his blaster quit.\n A click. A faint hiss when he\n frantically jerked the trigger\n again and again, and the spent\n cells released themselves from\n the device, falling in the grass\n at his feet. He dropped the useless\n gun.\n \n \"No!\" He threw himself on\n the ground as a new robot suddenly\n appeared around the edge\n of the building a few feet away,\n aimed, and fired. Air burned\n over Alan's back and ozone tingled\n in his nostrils.\n \n Blinding itself for a few seconds\n with its own blaster static,\n the robot paused momentarily,\n jiggling in place. In this\n instant, Alan jammed his hands\n into an insect hill and hurled the\n pile of dirt and insects directly\n at the robot's antenna. In a flash,\n hundreds of the winged things\n erupted angrily from the hole in\n a swarming cloud, each part of\n which was a speck of life\n transmitting mental energy to the\n robot's pickup devices.\n \n Confused by the sudden dispersion\n of mind impulses, the\n robot fired erratically as Alan\n crouched and raced painfully for\n the door. It fired again, closer,\n as he fumbled with the lock\n release. Jagged bits of plastic and\n stone ripped past him, torn loose\n by the blast.\n \n Frantically, Alan slammed\n open the door as the robot, sensing\n him strongly now, aimed\n point blank. He saw nothing, his\n mind thought of nothing but the\n red-clad safety switch mounted\n beside the computer. Time stopped.\n There was nothing else in\n the world. He half-jumped, half-fell\n towards it, slowly, in tenths\n of seconds that seemed measured\n out in years.\n \n The universe went black.\n \n Later. Brilliance pressed upon\n his eyes. Then pain returned, a\n multi-hurting thing that crawled\n through his body and dragged\n ragged tentacles across his\n brain. He moaned.\n \n A voice spoke hollowly in the\n distance. \"He's waking. Call his\n wife.\"\n \n Alan opened his eyes in a\n white room; a white light hung\n over his head. Beside him, looking\n down with a rueful smile,\n stood a young man wearing\n space medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\n he acknowledged the question in\n Alan's eyes, \"you hit the switch.\n That was three days ago. When\n you're up again we'd all like to\n thank you.\"\n \n Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\n green-eyed girl was pressed\n tightly against him. Neither of\n them spoke. They couldn't. There\n was too much to say.\n \n \n THE END", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "cb523904420e45249e25c9ec38ad7ea3", "response_text": "Alan is walking when he hears a sudden crash that hangs sharply in the air. He loses his footing and trips, realizing that there is a possibility of blaster fighting. He hurries to mark an X on a tree for his position and heads back to the clearing of the temporary camp site. This place is home to the only eleven humans, with Alan, on the planet of Waiamea. Once Alan returns to the site, he observes the killer robots and praises Pete for getting them to work. However, when the robots turn on him, he realizes that the robots must have been programmed to pick up human brain waves. He thinks back to Penny, a girl he married three weeks ago who will be arriving with the rest of the colonists tomorrow. This becomes his reason to live against the killer robots, and he observes the killer robots. He fires into the undergrowth and berates himself for not loading fresh cells in the morning as the robot gets louder. He is injured by one and cries out as he feels himself dying. As the robot comes towards him again, he understands what it means to live and forces himself to keep walking. Alan then hugs the bank as pure electricity arches over him, sliding slowly and away from the machine above. The robot trembles and suddenly falls; this gives Alan an opportunity to tackle it. The two struggle, but Alan takes a hunting knife out and jams it into the robot. He wonders how Pete managed to create these robots so perfectly. Suddenly, he hears an approaching robot and realizes that they communicate with each other even if one of them is jammed. Alan decides to run towards the camp because he realizes that’s where the brain of the robots is located. Shortly after running, he finds himself lost because the camp has not appeared in sight yet. He tries to think back to where the camp could be and narrowly misses getting blasted by one of the killer robots. When he fires the pocket blaster, it cancels out the radio transmission from the computer to the robot; Alan sees this as an opportunity to go towards the headquarters building. His blaster suddenly quits, but he manages to hurl a pile of dirt and insects at the robots. He goes into the room quickly as the robot continues to blast. The robot aims point blank at him as he hurls himself towards the red-clad safety switch. Everything then fades to black. When Alan wakes up again, there is a young man wearing a medical insignia telling him that he had hit the switch three days ago. Suddenly, his wife appears, and they hold each other tight.

He sees that the other colonists in the camp were already killed, and Alan himself is accidentally saved by a predator who attacks the robot aiming at him. The metal killers are now moving around the territory, guarding it, and trying to pick up somebody’s brain waves. Remembering his wife Peggy and everyone else who was going to land on the next day, Alan decides to at least try to fight the robots and prevent them from killing everybody on this approaching ship. He runs through the jungle, bruising his arms and legs, getting bitten by insects, and manages to temporarily disable the robot by half-drowning him in the river and stabbing his metal corpus with a knife.

Mine was no satisfaction, never earned me a penny—and now it had me fighting for my life in ...\n \n \n THE LITTLE RED BAG\n \n\n By JERRY SOHL\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made\n the discovery. I had finished reading the Chronicle , folded and put\n it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the\n San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I\n returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed\n gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats\n before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.\n \n I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now\n she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and\n calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a\n window where there was nothing to see.\n \n I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a\n togetherness-type-magazine reader.\n \n Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I\n should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles\n for, and not wanting to.\n \n So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps\n that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever\n complained.\n \n It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore\n the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers\n and—well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.\n It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from\n electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me how they hurt.\n \n Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always\n knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and\n therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel\n the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the\n same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell\n if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just\n the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to\n become pretty good at guessing.\n \n Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object\n in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it—a lipstick. A round, hard\n object with dust inside—a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small\n book, probably an address book, money in a change purse—a few bills\n and coins. Not much else.\n \n I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.\n But I never say anything.\n \n \n\n \n I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when\n Miss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat\n my sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some\n of the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.\n Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd\n be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during\n her absence, which I dutifully did.\n \n Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for\n her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and\n looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while\n she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which\n she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.\n \n \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out.\n \n I was sent home with a stinging note.\n \n Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able\n to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other\n people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.\n \n I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but\n how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the\n things I sense in probing really are.\n \n But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A\n feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or\n heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's\n window. And I can stop clocks.\n \n Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty\n because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco\n International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it\n seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement\n and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last\n time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the\n pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its\n delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting\n influence to decrease the restoring torque.\n \n The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite\n a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I\n can't stand the alarm.\n \n When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went\n to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls\n and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate\n about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped\n quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.\n \n So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that\n it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.\n \n The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out\n the window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her\n we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced\n at her wristwatch and sank back again.\n \n Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I\n contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about\n Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement\n chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were\n maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind\n wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of\n luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through\n slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a\n ukulele.\n \n I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first.\n \n \n\n \n The bomb was in a small bag—a woman's bag judging by the soft,\n flimsy things you'd never find in a man's—and I didn't know it was a\n bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,\n quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me\n was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be\n electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more\n closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard\n round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my\n neck when I suddenly realized what it was.\n \n The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past\n the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own\n alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.\n \n It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.\n \n My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around\n at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I\n thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was\n there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.\n We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles\n soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.\n \n But of course that had been the plan!\n \n My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind\n was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd\n think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be\n panic and they'd never get the plane down in time—if they believed me.\n \n \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,\n smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small\n paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped\n doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a\n napkin.\n \n I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd\n look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at\n the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.\n \n I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent\n a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that\n balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried\n to close everything off—the throb of engines, the rush of air, the\n woman sipping coffee noisily beside me—and I went into the clock and\n surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;\n when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was\n like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going\n to be able to stop it.\n \n Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not\n afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold\n until it came to a dead stop.\n \n \"Anything the matter?\"\n \n My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to\n me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was\n still chewing.\n \n \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\"\n \n \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back\n and forth.\"\n \n \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When\n she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,\n just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy\n with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good.\n \n \n\n \n All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to\n the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would\n start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.\n I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe\n calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.\n Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock—but not before the\n bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would\n be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man\n literally with gimlet eyes.\n \n Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of\n the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,\n but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it\n was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n \n To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing\n my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging\n and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n \n A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n \n \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n \n I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I\n looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took\n it without a word and went away.\n \n \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n \n \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to\n fits, but I didn't.\n \n It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest\n minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when\n the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n \n Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as\n unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking\n through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I\n had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.\n So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and\n watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield\n carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n \n It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained\n the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The\n assortment of bags—a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors—was\n packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where\n I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the\n balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a\n ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded\n and placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n \n There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,\n and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to\n determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was\n the attendant and I had two bags—my own battered veteran of years, and\n a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n \n I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and—a\n clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n \n I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward\n and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I\n entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to\n immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes.\n \n \n\n \n The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I\n stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented\n it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I\n was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with\n his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it\n toward me.\n \n \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the\n remaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n \n \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But\n he was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n \n I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n \n \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n \n He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n \n I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance\n and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying\n over.\n \n \"Cab?\"\n \n I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n \n Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n \n I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage\n claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran\n through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied\n me.\n \n I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a\n man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing\n something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could\n I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the\n bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to\n live with myself.\n \n No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until—until\n what?\n \n A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of\n the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a\n pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could\n tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the\n whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own\n business.\n \n But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started\n across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,\n\"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But\n I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim\n counter out of the side of my eye.\n \n The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp\n to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went\n inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag\n on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The\n clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n \n I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How\n many minutes—or seconds—were left? I was sweating when I moved to the\n counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I\n had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the\n clock again.\n \n \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n \n \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n \n I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the\n counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the\n device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel\n escaped my grasp.\n \n \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n \n I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood\n there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand\n she had a green baggage claim check.\n \n The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight\n case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,\n glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n \n \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying\n after her.\n \n \n\n \n At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, \"Listen to me.\"\n \n She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.\n \n \"It's a matter of life or death,\" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag\n from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I\n restrained myself.\n \n She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled\n suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,\n\"Please put the bag down. Over there.\" I indicated a spot beside a\n telephone booth where it would be out of the way.\n \n She didn't move. She just said, \"Why?\"\n \n \"For God's sake!\" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her\n bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing\n there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue\n and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,\n I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me\n or anything else right now if it had.\n \n \"I've got to talk to you. It's very important.\"\n \n The girl said, \"Why?\" I was beginning to think it was the only word she\n knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill\n someone so lovely.\n \n \"I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a\n telephone call.\" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, \"And\n don't ask me why.\"\n \n She gave me a speculative look.\n \n I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, \"All right,\n but—\"\n \n I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,\n pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in\n there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this\n range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.\n \n Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.\n \n \"Now will you please tell me what this is all about?\" she said stiffly.\n \n \"Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.\"\n \n She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed\n the short, fat man into the coffee shop.\n \n Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory\n ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and\n how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.\n \n During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew\n pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears\n there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.\n \n \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but\n staring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes\n she was reliving some recent scene.\n \n \"Who is Joe?\"\n \n \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got\n control again. \"This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my\n sister.\" Her smile was bleak. \"I see now why he wanted to put in those\n books. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put\n in some books we'd both finished reading—for my sister. That's when he\n must have put the—put it in there.\"\n \n I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\"\n \n \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was\n close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I\n want to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.\n \n \"It's all right now?\" she asked.\n \n I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\"\n \n I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been\n thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the\n airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl—she said her\n name was Julia Claremont—agreed to tell him she thought there was a\n bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried\n because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it\n would have to do.\n \n \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for\n his coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\"\n \n \n\n \n I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.\n I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other\n people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy\n for a long while.\n \n \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.\n She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled\n a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all\n for me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\"\n \n It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again\n when we reached the lobby.\n \n The two bags weren't there.\n \n I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.\n \n \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered\n suitcase?\"\n \n \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just\n stepped out of here—\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\"\n \n The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,\n mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.\n \n \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him.\n \n The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came\n abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door\n and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.\n \n The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I\n reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then\n walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the\n redcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\"\n \n \"That he did,\" I said.\n \n Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the\n parking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\"\n \n The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get\n over to the office.\"\n \n But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant\n shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.\n \n \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky.\n \n \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to\n me.\"\n \n We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe\n in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That\n was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was\n thinking.\n \n She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me.\n \n The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\"\n \n \"I—I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\"\n \n \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't\n bother to report it?\"\n \n \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't make you report it.\"\n \n \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some\n air. Can't we walk a little?\"\n \n \"Sure,\" I said.\n \n We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill\n with the distant sounds of sirens.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "109", "uid": "d951e09dfc734bc08b8758b2dfbe6dd2", "response_text": "On a seemingly normal flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles sits our protagonist, on his way to complete a printing order.

The protagonist is also revealed to be able to manipulate time by stopping clocks, which he uses to his benefit with early wake-up calls. Despite his unique abilities, he laments that it renders largely useless and mundane as it often ruins surprises like Christmas gifts, requires a bit of guessing, and fails to work as gimmicks in manipulating games like Vegas slot machines. \n\nAnd so with his seemingly useless but curious gaze, the protagonist ponders about his seat-mate’s purse, Amos Magaffey the purchasing agent, and rifling through luggages and identifying his own. All of sudden, his musings are halted by the discovery of a bomb in one of the luggages, with a countdown timer ticking with 10 minutes or less. The flight is still 40 minutes away from its destination and so with great effort and increasing suspicion from his seat-mate, the protagonist uses his ability to stop the ticking bomb. The flight lands safely with the bomb remaining inactivated, but the protgaonist now worries between alerting authorities - which may cast suspicion upon himself - or follow the luggage and identify who picks it up. With no one initially picking up the luggage with the bomb - the little red bag - it is delivered by the flight attendant to the rear room. Soon, a young lady arrives to pick it up. It is then that the protagonist hurries over to her in hopes of warning her of the ticking time bomb. It turns out that the likely culprit of planting the bomb is the young lady’s - Julia Claremont - husband, whose motives are unknown but nevertheless unhinged. Armed with this information and a false story about the bag’s suspicion, the pair decides to approach an airport policeman and inform them of the bomb. However, as they return to where they left their bags, they find that both his and Julia’s luggages have been stolen by a strange man entering his grey vehicle. Turning to the airport policeman in reporting this stolen luggage, they are interrupted by an explosion in a grey vehicle. Shocked and somber, Julia and the protagonist inform the policeman that they no longer wish to report the stolen luggage, and the two begin to walk away from the airport. \n"}, {"worker_id": "113", "uid": "0a53b3c2f9524b75926a004ea5aba4dd", "response_text": "The protagonist and narrator of the story is a man who long ago discovered that he had an extraordinary ability: sensing the contents of different objects, like boxes and bags, and moving light things, like feathers or a watch balance wheel, without touching them. He got in trouble for naively using his gift in the fourth grade and has kept quiet about it ever since. At the beginning of the story, he is on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles for a business meeting with an amusement chain owner. After studying the passengers around him, checking the window view, and mentally looking through the purse of a woman next to him, he decides to find his suitcase in the luggage compartment of the plane. The narrator is going through the content of other people’s suitcases when he feels something resembling a bomb. It seems to be inside a small woman’s bag and is about to go off in ten minutes, but the plane is supposed to land only in forty. Anxious and hectic, he refuses the cup of coffee from a stewardess and decides that he has to stop the clock mechanism, at least for the duration of the flight. He does it every morning with his alarm, so it doesn’t seem impossible. After temporarily stopping it, his thoughts race ahead to the landing, realizing that he wouldn’t be able to control the mechanism forever or tell the truth to the police. But his thinking process is disturbed by turbulence - he realizes that the balance wheel is moving again. After some tugging, pulling, and shoving, it finally becomes immovable. When the plane lands, the protagonist goes to the baggage claim and tries to find the owner of the bag. After picking up his suitcase and watching how the claim employees take the bag with the bomb to the storage room, he finally sees a blond woman called Julia Claremont - he saw her on the flight - approaching the counter. He convinces her to put the bag down and pretends that he is speaking to someone in a telephone booth while deactivating the mechanism once again. When she asks for an explanation, he invites her to an airport coffee shop and tells her everything. At the end of his monologue, she starts crying and says that her husband Joe probably put it in her bag after she had finished packing the day before. That trip was Joe’s idea, but she doesn’t know why her husband would do something like that. They go back to the gate to realize that the bags they had left there are gone.

Without his extraordinary ability to feel around any enclosed object, he would not be able to detect and temporarily stop the bomb’s timer before it was too late. This is also significant because the plane would have exploded had he not found it. The airport is important too because that is where he meets Julia.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n When nobody aboard ship remembers where it's going, how can they tell when it has arrived?\n \n \n \n Every day for a week now, Rikud had come to the viewport to watch the great changeless sweep of space. He could not quite explain the feelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since the engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone, from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his life, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had grown.\n \n If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This disturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had realized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside him.\n \n Today, space looked somehow different. The stars—it was a meaningless concept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright pinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport—were not apparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead, there was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart by itself in the middle of the viewport.\n \n If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was odd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was—it was—what was it?\n \n Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and greeted gray-haired old Chuls.\n \n \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you'll be ready to sire children. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\"\n \n Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the health-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it; he just didn't, without comprehending.\n \n Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the time he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select as his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud ignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling he could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man had? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always embroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a headache?\n \n Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here and knew it was your time, too....\"\n \n His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not explain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had departed almost before Chuls knew of its existence.\n \n \"I'll go with you,\" Rikud told him.\n \n \n\n \n A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of the health-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the ray tubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacant tube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watch the one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growing larger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and a metallic voice said. \"Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.\"\n \n Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoy him. Now why shouldn't a man be permitted to do what he wanted, when he wanted to do it? There was a strange thought, and Rikud's brain whirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions and unsatisfactory answers.\n \n He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever got hurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl himself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen. But something soft had cushioned the impact—something which had come into being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-being again, something which was as impalpable as air.\n \n Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no real authority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt that there should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machine in the library had told him of the elders—a meaningless term—who had governed the world. They told you to do something and you did it, but that was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You only listened to the buzzer.\n \n And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said. There had been a revolt—again a term without any real meaning, a term that could have no reality outside of the reading machine—and the elders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The people had decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, and that it was unfair that the elders alone had this authority. They were born and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like little cogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, but he knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with the people against the elders, and it said the people had won.\n \n Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he had to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see the look of easy contentment on Chuls' face as the rays fanned down upon him, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations before Rikud's time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge of medicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old age, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud often thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future, not without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only a decade to go.\n \n Under the tube at Rikud's left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavy through the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every time Rikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True, this was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it proved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he saw Crifer limp.\n \n But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer.\n \n \n\n \n Now Crifer said, \"I've been reading again, Rikud.\"\n \n \"Yes?\" Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with the smell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it meant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the library and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat about and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.\n \n But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the people ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it was always the same.\n \n \"Yes,\" said Crifer. \"I found a book about the stars. They're also called astronomy, I think.\"\n \n This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one elbow. \"What did you find out?\"\n \n \"That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.\"\n \n \"Well, where's the book?\" Rikud would read it tomorrow.\n \n \"I left it in the library. You can find several of them under\n'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous terms.\"\n \n \"You know,\" Rikud said, sitting up now, \"the stars in the viewport are changing.\"\n \n \"Changing?\" Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he questioned what it might mean in this particular case.\n \n \"Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the others.\"\n \n \"Astronomy says some stars are variable,\" Crifer offered, but Rikud knew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he did.\n \n Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. \"Variability,\" he told them, \"is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.\"\n \n \"I'm only saying what I read in the book,\" Crifer protested mildly.\n \n \"Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words without meaning.\"\n \n \"People grow old,\" Rikud suggested.\n \n A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and Chuls said, \"It's almost time for me to eat.\"\n \n Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the two concepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago, but now it faded, and change and old were just two words.\n \n His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange feeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the viewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of the world, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman. He had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly remembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed; this was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings—strange channelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.\n \n He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the stars again.\n \n \n\n \n The view had changed, and the strangeness of it made Rikud's pulses leap with excitement. All the stars were paler now than before, and where Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of light, white with a tinge of blue in it, and so bright that it hurt his eyes to look.\n \n Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to turn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed to control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white globe—if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There was that word change again. Didn't it have something to do with age? Rikud couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's book on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was variable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age.\n \n Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer, and he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that he couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his eyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them. But the new view persisted.\n \n Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone, too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge that it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and round, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud had no name.\n \n A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section of it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the viewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the middle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green, and on the other, blue.\n \n Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular intervals by a sharp booming.\n \n Change—\n \n \"Won't you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below.\n \n \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I'll eat. Later.\"\n \n \"It's time....\" Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.\n \n But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him, and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw—what he had always seen, except that now there was the added factor of change—perhaps did not exist in the viewport.\n \n Maybe it existed through the viewport.\n \n That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more confusing than ever.\n \n \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\"\n \n \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow.\n \n Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of vapor. \"What do you see?\"\n \n Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\"\n \n \"What else?\"\n \n \"Else? Nothing.\"\n \n Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do you hear?\"\n \n \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of the engines. \"I'm hungry, Rikud.\"\n \n The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining room, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more.\n \n \n\n \n Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a moment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world. But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far vaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport which was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover, did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens did. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.\n \n Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.\n \n The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.\n \n \n\n \n For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept it as fact. There—through the viewport and in it—was a garden. A garden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had never seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the world's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless, it was a garden.\n \n He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\n \n Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\" he admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\n \n Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could not tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the viewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking—the word seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless it were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere was the garden and the world had arrived.\n \n \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants are different.\"\n \n \"Then they've changed?\"\n \n \"No, merely different.\"\n \n \"Well, what about the viewport? It changed. Where are the stars? Where are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"\n \n \"The stars come out at night.\"\n \n \"So there is a change from day to night!\"\n \n \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they shine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"\n \n \"Once they shone all the time.\"\n \n \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\"\n \n \n\n \n Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on astronomy. He hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the reading machine had begun to bore him. He said, \"Well, variable or not, our whole perspective has changed.\"\n \n And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only the man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so obvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another, it was with a purpose—to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the health-rays. Now if the world had walked from—somewhere, through the vast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also was purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But if everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could they find the nature of that purpose?\n \n \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery.\n \n Damn the man, all he did was eat!\n \n Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry.\n \n And Rikud, too, was hungry.\n \n Differently.\n \n \n\n \n He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and now, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading machine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the door.\n \n \"What's in here?\" he demanded.\n \n \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\n \n \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"\n \n \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean through the door.\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened it. It's only a door.\"\n \n \"I will,\" said Rikud.\n \n \"You will what?\"\n \n \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"\n \n A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"\n \n \"I think so.\"\n \n \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before? There's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"\n \n \"No—\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of breath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently, and Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\n \n Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other end of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across, Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\n \n He missed the beginning, but then:\n  —therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this door. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the rigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may have discarded it for something better—who knows? But if you have not, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship is a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is human-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not permit it—within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and to avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be permitted through this door—\n \n \n Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing words. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting than that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another voice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.\n \n When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle humming, punctuated by a throb-throb-throb which sounded not unlike the booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't blast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's eyes—he blinked and looked again, but it was still there—cogs and gears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\n \n \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but no one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\n \n Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\n \n Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and, although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way off in the distance.\n \n And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new viewport. He began to turn the handle.\n \n Then he trembled.\n \n What would he do out in the garden?\n \n He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud couldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt dry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.\n \n Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back through the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally through the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\n \n By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did not dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and sweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the garden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could walk and then might find himself in the garden.\n \n It was so big.\n \n \n\n \n Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to talk about his experience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all interested, yet the lame-footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable and Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that book on astronomy.\n \n Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. \"There are not that many doors in the world,\" he said. \"The library has a door and there is a door to the women's quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through that. But there are no others.\"\n \n Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. \"Now, by the world, there are two other doors!\"\n \n Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly.\n \n \"What are you doing that for?\" demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than Crifer, but had no lame foot.\n \n \"Doing what?\"\n \n \"Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble hearing you.\"\n \n \"Maybe yelling will make him understand.\"\n \n Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig.\n\"Why don't we go see?\" he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned.\n \n \"Well, I won't go,\" Chuls replied. \"There's no reason to go. If Rikud has been imagining things, why should I?\"\n \n \"I imagined nothing. I'll show you—\"\n \n \"You'll show me nothing because I won't go.\"\n \n Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what he did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at the blouse.\n \n \"Stop that,\" said the older man, mildly.\n \n \n\n \n Crifer hopped up and down. \"Look what Rikud's doing! I don't know what he's doing, but look. He's holding Chuls' blouse.\"\n \n \"Stop that,\" repeated Chuls, his face reddening.\n \n \"Only if you'll go with me.\" Rikud was panting.\n \n Chuls tugged at his wrist. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of them watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud holding Chuls' blouse.\n \n \"I think I can do that,\" declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer's shirt.\n \n Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each partner grabbing for his companion's blouse. They giggled and laughed and some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done.\n \n A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls.\n \n Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, \"Time to retire.\"\n \n In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his throat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What would have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the buzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it.\n \n What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?\n \n This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd like it, though. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be afraid because he could huddle close to them and he wouldn't be alone.\n \n \n\n \n Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the machinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears spinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears, would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he was clearly an \"unauthorized person.\" He had heard the voice again upon entering the room.\n \n He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as wide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that held it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he swung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding, crashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled under his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.\n \n \n\n \n Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not casual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud smashed everything in sight.\n \n When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room was a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first, but presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in his ears because now the throbbing had stopped.\n \n He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller viewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain beneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone clearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.\n \n Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that door. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once, when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the darkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.\n \n Whimpering, he fled.\n \n \n\n \n All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did not sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to eat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the whimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the smooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.\n \n Chuls said, over and over, \"I'm hungry.\"\n \n \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied confidently.\n \n \"It won't any more,\" Rikud said.\n \n \"What won't?\"\n \n \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\"\n \n Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad thing you did, Rikud.\"\n \n \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the stars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there beyond the viewport.\"\n \n \"That's ridiculous,\" Chuls said.\n \n Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can eat. I hate Rikud, I think.\"\n \n There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I hate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it.\n \n Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's quarters. Did women eat?\n \n Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the plants in the viewport would even be better.\n \n \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\"\n \n \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully.\n \n Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\"\n \n \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won't.\"\n \n \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you, too, to show you how it is to be broken.\"\n \n \"We must go outside—through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made.\n \n A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard Crifer's voice. \"I have Rikud's head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile.\n \n Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had broken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer to understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.\n \n The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face.\n\"I hit him! I hit him!\"\n \n Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone was on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and he did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too weak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing hurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voices and the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.\n \n It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run was chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and how big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him were unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely and positively.\n \n He became sickly giddy thinking about it.\n \n But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would die because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and grumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.\n \n He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library, through the inner door and into the room with the voice—but the voice didn't speak this time—through its door and into the place of machinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and he thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.\n \n Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.\n \n He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness, it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those behind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not far away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to break him.\n \n Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life. The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of low mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If plants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could people. Rikud and his people should . This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more. But he was afraid.\n \n He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head. Slowly he slipped to the cool floor—how his head was burning!—and for a long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside he heard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on the metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest:\n\"There is Rikud on the floor!\"\n \n Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright. Something small and brown scurried across the other side of the viewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous red eyes.\n \n Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face was so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that everyone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the machinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal which he could see in the dim light through the open door.\n \n \"Where's the buzzer?\" he sobbed. \"I must find the buzzer.\"\n \n Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, \"You broke it. You broke it. And now we will break you—\"\n \n Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped down against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps came, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway. Then there were others, and then they were walking toward him.\n \n His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it be variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying brown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his stomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing could live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness, then so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others....\n \n So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. And his heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side of his neck.\n \n He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where the blue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the row of mounds.\n \n \n\n \n Crifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, and someone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall. He kicked out and the hands let go, and then he turned the handle and shoved the weight of his body with all his strength against the door.\n \n It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth.\n \n The air was fresh, fresher than any air Rikud had ever breathed. He walked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feel the floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the horizon. It was all very beautiful.\n \n Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across the land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and when he got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of the others followed. They stood around for a long time before going to the water to drink.\n \n \n\n \n Rikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It was good.\n \n Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. \"Even feelings are variable. I don't hate you now, Rikud.\"\n \n Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. \"People are variable, too, Crifer. That is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.\"\n \n \"They're women,\" said Crifer.\n \n They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completely human, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly exciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness. With so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid.\n \n It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer, frightening doors and women by appointment only.\n \n Rikud felt at home.", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "111", "uid": "f79f2525868d40058315766e1347c0da", "response_text": "The story starts off with the main character, Rikud, watching space from a viewport that is located on what seems to be a spaceship.

Old Chuls approaches him and chides him for staring at stars when he is almost ready to foster children in five years. Rikud is nervous because no other man has these thoughts about who the Calculator will select as their mate. Chuls says that it is time for his bath in the health-rays, and Rikud goes with him. When they get to the health-ray area, Rikud feels the urge to see the stars again. The machine tells him fifteen minutes under the tub. Crifer, who is in the tube on his left, brings satisfaction to Rikud through his lame foot because it is proof that the world is not perfect. Crifer tells Rikud that he has been reading about astronomy lately in the library and stars. When Rikud tells him that the stars are changing, Crifer offers that variability may contribute.

Noting the lack of authority - the closest being the automated buzzer - he ponders the perfectness of life around him and realizes he is assured by Crifer’s limp because it demonstrated that not everything was perfect. When talking to him, Crifer reveals that he has begun reading again in lieu of the normal evening activity of chatting to other ship passengers.

Rikud even becomes angry for the first time, grabbing Chuls’ blouse when the man doesn’t believe that Rikud found some new rooms with another viewport. Admitting this would mean admitting the reality of change and Chuls can’t do that.  When Rikud breaks the buzzer, the sound mechanism that controls the ship’s inhabitants’ daily life, Chuls cannot realize that eating is possible without it, again showing how dependent he is on the ship’s regulated way of life.

Ultimately it is the viewport that showed him the possibility of a new life on the planet. The viewport essentially lead Rikud to breaking the engine room and to opening the door of the ship.

He believes that there is a greater purpose for him in the world, even if he has spent his entire life on the ship. There is a bright star that Rikuld sees through it, and it bothers him nonstop. When he looks through the viewport again, he sees that the bright central star has become a blue-tinged globe of light. This is extremely significant because what Rikud is observing is actually the ship’s landing on a new planet. This motivates him to investigate further, and he finds that the scenery has not changed for a week after a garden begins to enter the viewport’s field of vision. The viewport also serves as a reason for Rikud to break the ship’s buzzer announcement system; this stops everybody from living their pre-programmed way of life and to leave the ship for the more mysterious world outside. Without the viewport, Rikud would have never noticed the changes in space and as they eventually land on the planet.

It is the only window into what exists outside of the ship, and throughout the story, we can see that it is where change and a variability in landscape is seen. \n\nIt is significant because what Rikud sees through the viewport is what begins to create dissonance in his relationship with the world around him. It is only when he begins to notice the change in the stars, the appearance of a sphere with blue and green, and a bright light that he further questions why the men live on the ship and not outside. Additionally, it is significant because the viewport is one-dimensional in that all information is one-way. Whatever Rikud and the other men see through the viewport can only be explained by them, and so they have no way of knowing if it is true or not. As seen in the story, many times the other men are reluctant to even wonder what it is or simply shrug and move on. \n"}, {"worker_id": "113", "uid": "cea70479b2c3463b90fdc5b5c98c4c16", "response_text": "The story talks about our distant future. Humans left Earth long ago and now live on a spaceship that has been traveling through space for centuries. Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity: eating, sleeping, free time. They do not understand the concepts of change, space, because their life is limited to the rooms of the ship. The main character, Rikud, is a young man who enjoys looking at the viewport - it allows him to see the stars surrounding the ship and the cosmic blackness. He spends some time every day contemplating the view and notices when the stars change in size and location, disappearing from the view. This observation makes him think about variability and change, what these terms mean. When sometime later Rikud sees an unchanging image of a garden instead of cosmos in the viewport, he starts questioning the space he’s so long lived in. His attempt to rationalize this makes him more curious, and soon he finds another viewport that also looks like a door to the outer world. A different angle of view surprises him since he has always thought that there’s only one possible viewpoint on this ship. After days of chaotic thoughts and revelations, after breaking the buzzer and causing the inhabitants’ anger, Rikud finally opens the small viewport and sets foot in the garden, allowing everyone else to leave the ship, too.
