I\nfancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the\nwisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two\nweeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of\nweeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure\nto bear.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even\nyou to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may\nbe the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more\ncultivated channels.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,\nglancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Magnan nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military\ncampaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of\nthe Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that\nprecedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Breaking and entering,\" Retief said. \"You may have something there.\nBut I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial\nworld of the poor but honest variety.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"\nMagnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together. See\nthat you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will\nbe an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic\nrestraint—not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That—bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk\nscreen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"\nMagnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here\nat Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's\nbutton.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Send the bucolic person in.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers\nof heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,\nstepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at\nsight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held\nout his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face\nto face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his\nhand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I\nstarted it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were\nall ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.\nWhat I wanted to see you about was—\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,\nout on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just\nabout ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't\nknow if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.\nArapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,\npuffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,\nthe vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.\nWe like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.\nApples the size of a melon—and sweet—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and\nEducation Division come in?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks\ncan't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the\nland area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable\nforest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.\nRetief.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our\nyear's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric\norbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly\npainting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.\nLots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for\nwoodworkers. Our furniture—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil\nand those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then\ncomes the Monsoon. Rain—it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting\ncloser. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?\nThat's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay\ninside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach\non Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.\nThe theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have\nthe music and the surf and the bonfires and stars—we're close to the\ncenter of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the\nordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't\ntake long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new\nplaces ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a\nlot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this\nyear's different. This is Wine Year.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine\ncrop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going.\nBut this year....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The crop isn't panning out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only\ntwenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's\nnot the crop.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the\nCommercial—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever\nsettled for anything else!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have\nto try them some time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No\ntime like the present,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both\ndusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This isn't\n  <i>\n   drinking\n  </i>\n  . It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire\nretainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the\nair. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.\n\"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come\nto think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint\nnative customs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep\nrust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked\nat Arapoulous thoughtfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted\nport.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a\nmouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus\nwine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second\nbottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine\nand black.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,\ncaught it as it popped up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You\nprobably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years\nback?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two\nfresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,\nswallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.\nWe like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a\nforce. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than\nwe did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.\nBut it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\nbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow\nmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\nexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\nyou're doing it for strangers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief\nsaid. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\nwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\nturn over to machinery—and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\nseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\nFirst, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\ncovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\nhere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\ngrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\nto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on\nwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\nand it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\nthe tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\nroast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\nfruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\ndone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\nfor the best crews.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\nfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\nget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\nborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\ntoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\nof grape juice?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after\na vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad.\nWe've got a bumper crop—and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big\nvintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then\nnext vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You hocked the vineyards?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red\nis hard to beat....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan\nto see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd\nrepay it in sculpture, painting, furniture—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling\nside-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci\nnose-flute players—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can they pick grapes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over\nwith the Labor Office?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics\nspecialists and computer programmers we wanted—but no field hands.\nSaid it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought\nI was trying to buy slaves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then\nafterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he\nsaid. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.\nCheck with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles\nhere. Cultural exhibits, you know.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague\nacross the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.\nWhat are they getting?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over\nat MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the\nsole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and\nExchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's no harm in\ntelling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,\nblinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE\ninterested in MEDDLE's activities?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up\nearlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over\non—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient\nproblems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Speaking of tractors,\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special\nCommittee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'\nGeneral Economies have been trying for months to get a request for\nmining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\" Whaffle said. \"First come, first\nserved. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\" He strode\noff, briefcase under his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\" the SCROUNGE committeeman\nsaid. \"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out\nto pacify her. While my chance to make a record—that is, assist\npeace-loving d'Land—comes to naught.\" He shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're\nsending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an\ninstitution.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two\n  <i>\n   hundred\n  </i>\n  students would overtax the\nfacilities of the college.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise\ntrade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students\nindeed!\" He snorted and walked away.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the\nelevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a\ncab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them\nlined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half\nan hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and\nordered a beer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Happy days,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And nights to match.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.\nYep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place\nwaiting....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You meeting somebody?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect—Never mind. Have one on\nme.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know—\" he turned\nto Retief—\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped.\n\"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I represent MUDDLE.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of\nan advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like\na game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under\npressure. If I had my old platoon—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So\nlong, friend. Or are you coming along?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of\nthe Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to\nattention, his chest out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Drop that, mister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to\nact?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to\ntown? We fellas were thinking—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now\nline up!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have quarters ready for the students,\" Retief said. \"If you'd like\nto bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid\non.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks,\" said Karsh. \"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't\nhave the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about\ngoing over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long\nwait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He\nhiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" Karsh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh\nwinked. \"And bring a few beers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging\nfrom Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female\nstudents?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch\nis received.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound\nfor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would that be the Technical College?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these\ndetails.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief\nsaid. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are\ntravelling so far to study—at Corps expense.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Magnan never—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves\nme with the question of two thousand young male students headed for\na world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.\nBut the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation\nto Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on\nLovenbroy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well!\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.\n\"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\" Retief said. \"But\nnever mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors\nwill Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\" Miss Furkle said. \"Mr. Magnan\nalways—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Miss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the\noffice, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps\nLibrary. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over\nindices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a\nmining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said.\n\"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit\nsection lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged\nit into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored\nvehicle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental\nsiege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want\nis a tractor. Model WV M-1—\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for\ndemolition work. That must be what confused you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Probably—among other things. Thank you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. \"I have the information you\nwanted,\" she said. \"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the\nimpression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" Retief said. \"Shoot. How many tractors?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Five hundred.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you sure?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five\nhundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and\nhip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \"CERP\n7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of\nBacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and\nsipped the black wine meditatively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the\nproduction of such vintages....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put\nthrough a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial\nAttache.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment,\nthe tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show\nwe're shipping five hundred units....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's correct. Five hundred.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred\ntractors.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\"\nRetief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps\nhalf a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they\ncould handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any\nore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining\noutfit? I should think—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?\nAnd in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the\nequipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four\nhundred and ninety tractors?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic\ntradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a\ngift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme\ncooking—\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a\nblade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us\nbranded as warmongers? Frankly—is this a closed line?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a\ndifficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation\nto a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"\nRetief said. \"Any connection?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who gets them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized\ntransshipment of grant material?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan\nrepresentative.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But\nlook here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang\noff, buzzed the secretary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new\napplications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement\nof students.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.\nMr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced\nman in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab\nshirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"What is it you wish?\" he barked. \"I understood in my discussions with\nthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these\nirritating conferences.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How\nmany this time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two thousand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And where will they be going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job is\nto provide transportation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will there be any other students embarking this season?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business.\" Gulver looked at Retief with\npursed lips. \"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another\ntwo thousand to Featherweight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Another under-populated world—and in the same cluster, I believe,\"\nRetief said. \"Your people must be unusually interested in that region\nof space.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of\nimportance to see to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \"I'd like to have a\nbreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the\npresent program,\" he said. \"And see if you can get a summary of what\nMEDDLE has been shipping lately.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Furkle compressed her lips. \"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure\nhe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.\nI ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie\nLegation—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The lists, Miss Furkle.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not accustomed,\" Miss Furkle said, \"to intruding in matters\noutside our interest cluster.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never\nmind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Loyalty to my Chief—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material\nI've asked for,\" Retief said. \"I'm taking full responsibility. Now\nscat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. \"MUDDLE, Retief speaking....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \"Sorry if I'm rushing you,\nRetief,\" he said. \"But have you got anything for me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief waved at the wine bottles. \"What do you know about Croanie?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like\nfish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon\ntime. Over a foot long.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You on good terms with them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here\na dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of\nbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy\ngame.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Furkle buzzed. \"I have your lists,\" she said shortly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bring them in, please.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye\nand grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous\nobserved. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\nto time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked\nfor the dispatch clerk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that\ncontingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT\ntransports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.\nHas it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.\nBut there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed\nclear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and\ntake a look at that baggage for me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The\nlevel in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to\nthe phone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.\nGuns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,\nI'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a\nfriend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you\nunderstand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that\nwill cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down\nto the port, Hank.

Those vessels aren't moving\nwithout it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No need to get so upset about a few toothbrushes, is there, Mr.\nKarsh?\" Retief said blandly. \"Still, if you're worried—\" He turned to\nArapoulous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hank, why don't you walk Mr. Karsh over to the warehouse and ...\nah ... take care of him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know just how to handle it,\" Arapoulous said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dispatch clerk came up to Retief. \"I caught the tractor equipment,\"\nhe said. \"Funny kind of mistake, but it's okay now. They're being\noff-loaded at d'Land. I talked to the traffic controller there. He said\nthey weren't looking for any students.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The labels got switched, Jim. The students go where the baggage was\nconsigned. Too bad about the mistake, but the Armaments Office will\nhave a man along in a little while to dispose of the guns. Keep an eye\nout for the luggage. No telling where it's gotten to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here!\" a hoarse voice yelled. Retief turned. A disheveled figure in a\ntight hat was crossing the enclosure, arms waving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi there, Mr. Gulver,\" Retief called. \"How's Boge's business coming\nalong?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Piracy!\" Gulver blurted as he came up to Retief, puffing hard. \"You've\ngot a hand in this, I don't doubt!

What's happened?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He had a little fall.

We'll see him safely aboard.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gulver turned, signaled frantically. Three heavy-set men in identical\ndrab suits detached themselves from the wall, crossed to the group.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take this man,\" Gulver snapped, indicating Karsh, who looked at him\ndazedly, reached up to rub his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We take our hospitality seriously,\" Retief said. \"We'll see him aboard\nthe vessel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gulver opened his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know you feel bad about finding guns instead of school books in\nyour luggage,\" Retief said, looking Gulver in the eye. \"You'll be busy\nstraightening out the details of the mix-up. You'll want to avoid\nfurther complications.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah. Ulp. Yes,\" Gulver said. He appeared unhappy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arapoulous went on to the passenger conveyor, turned to wave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your man—he's going too?\" Gulver blurted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's not our man, properly speaking,\" Retief said. \"He lives on\nLovenbroy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lovenbroy?\" Gulver choked. \"But ... the ... I....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know you said the students were bound for d'Land,\" Retief said. \"But\nI guess that was just another aspect of the general confusion. The\ncourse plugged into the navigators was to Lovenbroy. You'll be glad to\nknow they're still headed there—even without the baggage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps,\" Gulver said grimly, \"perhaps they'll manage without it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By the way,\" Retief said. \"There was another funny mix-up. There\nwere some tractors—for industrial use, you'll recall. I believe you\nco-operated with Croanie in arranging the grant through MEDDLE. They\nwere erroneously consigned to Lovenbroy, a purely agricultural world. I\nsaved you some embarrassment, I trust, Mr. Gulver, by arranging to have\nthem off-loaded at d'Land.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"D'Land! You've put the CSU's in the hands of Boge's bitterest enemies!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But they're only tractors, Mr. Gulver. Peaceful devices. Isn't that\ncorrect?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's ... correct.\" Gulver sagged. Then he snapped erect. \"Hold the\nships!\" he yelled. \"I'm canceling the student exchange—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice was drowned by the rumble as the first of the monster\ntransports rose from the launch pit, followed a moment later by the\nsecond, Retief watched them out of sight, then turned to Gulver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're off,\" he said. \"Let's hope they get a liberal education.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  V\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief lay on his back in deep grass by a stream, eating grapes.

And he's also the fellow that\ngot those workers for us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Delinda smiled at Retief. \"I've heard about you, Mr. Retief. We\nweren't sure about the boys at first. Two thousand Bogans, and all\nconfused about their baggage that went astray. But they seemed to like\nthe picking.\" She smiled again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's not all.

I'd have laid on\nsome kind of big welcome.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I liked the welcome I got. And I didn't have much notice. Mr. Magnan\nwas a little upset when he got back.

Magnan reminds Retief that his role is to act as a rubber stamp, continuing Magnan’s actions. Magnan points out that Retief should appreciate that Bogan is participating in the Exchange Program. Its participation might be a step toward sublimating their aggression into more cultivated channels. The Bogans are sending two thousand students to d’Land as exchange students, and Magnan thinks this might end their aggression and bring them into the cultural life of the Galaxy. Retief wonders aloud what the students will study in such a poor, industrial land. Magnan points out that this is none of Retief’s concern and that his role is simply to facilitate bringing the two groups together. When Miss Furkle, the secretary, buzzes Magnan that the bucolic person from Lovenbroy is there again, Magnan pushes the meeting off onto Retief.\n\nThe person from Lovenbroy is named Hank Arapoulous. He is a farmer and tells Retief that the Bacchus vines that they use to make their wine mature every twelve years and that this year is a harvest year, but they are short on workers to harvest the grapes. They have a shortage of workers for the harvest due to their conflict over strip mining and the loss of several of their young men in the battles to prevent it. Also, Lovenbroy had to borrow money from Croanie, and the loan was due. The wine crop will put them in the clear if they can harvest it. The biggest concern is what Croanie will do with the land if they can’t pay the loan; Lovenbroy has offered half its grape acreage as security for the loan it received. Hank asks Retief for a loan, but Retief tells him that MEDDLE’s role is only for transportation. Hank says he also checked with the Labor Office, but it only offered to set them up with machinery. \n\nRetief attends a council meeting and learns that Croanie will receive a shipment of strip mining equipment. A spokesman for the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations’ General Economies (SCROUNGE) indicates he has been trying to get mining equipment for d’Land. He tells Retief that Boge is a troublemaker, so all the agencies in the Corps are trying to appease her. Upon further discussion, Retief learns that d’Land doesn’t have a university for the exchange students to attend, just a technical college that would be overwhelmed to receive 200, much less 2,000, students. \n\nRetief also learns that all the exchange students are males, and their “luggage” is full of weapons. He diverts their luggage and sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy, where they help harvest the grapes. Retief is also sent to Lovenbroy for exceeding his authority. Hank tells Retief that he has won the prize for the picking competition. The prize is a girl named Delinda.\n\n"}, {"worker_id": "9", "uid": "5eecd525b99b4c098873d1b84d8594ef", "response_text": "Retief is left in charge of his division while his superior, Magnan, is out of the office. After a farmer from the planet Lovenbroy tries to enlist his help with a labor shortage, Retief realizes a complex plot has been set into motion by the government of the planet Boge. The Bogans are sending two-thousand students to the planet D’Land, except there’s no school to accommodate them there and they’re not actually students but soldiers. They’ve also arranged to have weapons and war vehicles shipped under the guise of student baggage and tractors. Boge is using the financial leverage they have with the planet Croanie to get them to help with these shipments, and to ultimately allow the Bogans to take over Lovenbroy (a planet in debt to Lovenbroy that Boge has tried and failed to conquer in the past), D’Land, and potentially another planet. After Retief uncovers how all of these plans and planets are connected, he moves to disrupt them. He reroutes the “students” to Lovenbroy to help with their grape harvest and allow them to get out of their debt to Croanie, and the war machines to D’Land where they’ll be out of Bogan hands. The end of the story finds Retief on Lovenbroy, where he has been sent because his superiors aren’t happy that he meddled with the Bogan situation.

Retief’s first order of business is dealing with Hank Arapoulous who came to MUDDLE to ask for some help harvesting the Bacchus grapes. He shares that they are indebted to Croanie, who loaned them funds after a failed invasion from the Bogans. Arapoulous is worried that the Croanie’s will be able to come in and harvest the grapes (as well as take the land) for themselves if they can’t pay the debt since they hold the mortgage on some of the acreage. After sharing some wine (alternating between red and black), Retief agrees to try and see if he can send some helping hands to Lovenbroy, Arapoulous’ home planet. \n\tRetief soon discovers that MEDDLE, another division at the Manpower Utilization Director, has authorized a shipment of 500 tractors that will be sent to Croanie. Retief questions Mr. Whaffle about it, and he explains that they are in need of heavy mining equipment. However, Croanie is mostly made up of fisheries, so there’s nothing to mine there. Retief questions other shipments as well, including the authorized transport of 2,000 Bogan students to d’Land. He discovers that there is only one technical college on d’Land and that it would be overwhelmed with just 200 transfer students. As well, Boge and d’Land have a very tense relationship; such a trade would be very rare. Sensing something fishy, Retief continues his search. \n\tOn his way to greet the incoming students, Retief stops at a bar and meets their teacher, Mr. Karsh. He describes training them as if they were in the military, not as if they were students. They leave together to meet the students. Retief arranged for a variety of fun events for the students, but Mr. Karsh shuts it all down. He simply wants to know when their luggage, flying in on a Croanie ship, will get in and when they will leave. \n\tQuickly, their plot falls apart as Retief researches these tractors and discovers they are machines built for war.

Retief reports to Second Secretary Magnan, who is taking some time off and asks Retief to manage affairs in his absence. He reminds Retief of a group of students from the planet Boge who will be traveling to the planet d’Land as part of an Exchange Program. Magnan’s hope is this program will help the warring Bogans better assimilate into the Galaxy’s culture. While he is gone, Retief meets with a man named Hank Arapoulous, who represents a planet called Lovenbroy, known for its plentiful grape harvests. Over wine, Hank requests labor to harvest the crop essential to their livelihood on Lovenbroy, and Retief learns of their connection to a planet called Croanie. Several years ago, the farmers of Lovenbroy had to defend their mineral resources against their neighbors, and they lost a lot of money and men in the process. Therefore, they had to borrow money from Croanie, and Hank is afraid they won’t be able to pay their debt on time without enough hands to harvest their grape crop. In addition, in their desperation, the farmers of Lovenbroy pawned the mortgage of their vineyards to Croanie thinking the twelve-year crop rotation would buy them enough time to pay back their debts. Retief says he will try to find a solution to his problem, and he sets about to attend the Intergroup Council and meet with the Bogan students set to depart for d’Land. At the Council meeting, he learns Croanie is set to receive a shipment of mining equipment from the Corps, and the school on d’Land set to receive the 2,000 Bogan students could hardly accommodate 200. At a bar later, Retief meets a man named Karsh, who drunkenly reveals he is training the students for something other than studying. At the library later, Retief learns that the tractors being sent to Croanie are not mining equipment, but are heavily armored with firepower. When Retief questions why so many tractors are being sent to a planet without the capacity to process them, he learns the excess will be sent to Boge. Retief deduces the entire situation is a Bogan plot to send troops to d’Land and have Croanie provide the military equipment sourced from Corps grants. Instead, Retief has representatives from Armaments confiscate the students’ luggage (which are actually filled with guns) and sends the “students” to Lovenbroy instead, where they help the farmers harvest their grape crop.

Somewhere out in suburban grayness a dog barked, then was\nsilent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, go,\" Wayne said. \"If you wanta walk. I'm taking the family\nboltbucket.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But we promised the Clemons, dear,\" his mother said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hell,\" Wayne said, grinning straight into the old man. \"I just got my\ndraft call.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw the old man's Adam's apple move. \"Oh, my dear boy,\" Mother cried\nout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So gimme the keys,\" Wayne said. The old man handed the keys over. His\nunderstanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he\nlaughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed\nthe Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp\nonto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling\nneon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed\nthe glaring wonders of escape.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strode\nunder a sign reading\n  <i>\n   Public Youth Center No. 947\n  </i>\n  and walked casually\nto the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and a\npansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a\npass, killer?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote\non a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and\ncheck out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to\nCaptain Jack, room 307.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.\nFinally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kid\nbreaking out tonight?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a\ncigarette. \"I've decided.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.\n\"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city and\nyou're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes\nare clever hellcats in a dark alley.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still\na counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head\nventilated, bud, and good.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the\nshelves and racks of weapons. \"I'll remember that crack when I get\nmy commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal's face. \"Bring me a\nSmith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in\na Skelly switchblade for kicks—the six-inch disguised job with the\ndouble springs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade\ndisguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,\nwhile Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the\ncylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped\nthe knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its\ngleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted\nincandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and\nscary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left\narmpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the\nway the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket\nback on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the\nelevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with\nstuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain\nJack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had\na head shaped like a grinning bear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to\nshrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea\namong bowling balls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy\nhead. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something\nin a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?\nReally going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.\nHis legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear\nthe way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll\nshow you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until\nhe screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,\nran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But\nthat wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,\nwhat was he doing holding down a desk?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly\ncollection.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch\nfrom Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped\na knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his\npasscard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make\nout.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West\nSide. Know where that is, punk?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow\nslacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a hefty\npsycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people.\nThey're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and\nthey're your key to the stars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright\nrespectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's\nquivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The\nOlds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from\nSlumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind.\nHe turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale,\nsecretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted\npotholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.\nWayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath\nthrough the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with\nthe shadows of mysterious promise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously\ninto it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as\nhe spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  <i>\n   FOUR ACES CLUB\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging\nthe sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass\nfiltering through windows painted black.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of\na bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked\nshirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub\nbalanced on one end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had\na dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a\ngrotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and\ndoom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Help me, kid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast\nof headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed\npast Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires\nsquealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and\ncrouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand\ncame up swinging a baseball bat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The\nteener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air\nas the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder\nat finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew\nand no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything.\nLiving seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,\nuntil something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He\nheld his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in\nspirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting\nlicense and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener\nlaughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell\nclogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth\nstill open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled\nup with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down\nwith his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the\nCad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling\nglass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go, man!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it\nbounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like\nbright wind-blown sparks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in\nscummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made\nhis heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and\npursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and\nstood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and\nyellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.\nThe eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red\nslash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for\nrunning, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near\nher, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude\nof being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a\nweirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty\nT-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse\nheavy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, teener.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and\nfed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She\nsat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons\nimbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one\nside. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious\ncat's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at\nhis lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated\non staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright\nbut dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little\nmouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in\nthe pay of the state.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What else, teener?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One thing. Fade.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his\nveins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped\nfast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the\nair. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the\nwhite eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her\nthroat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table\ncrashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast\nfilled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door\nholding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was\nout the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the\ncold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted\ndown the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and\nthen, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the\nlife-or-death animation of a wild deer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.\nThrough shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,\nsliding down a brick shute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her\nscream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She quivered above him on the stoop, panting, her eyes afire with\nterror.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You, baby,\" Wayne gasped. \"I gotcha.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She backed into darkness, up there against the sagging tenement wall,\nher arms out and poised like crippled wings. Wayne crept up. She gave\na squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked.\nHe clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated\nin the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling\nplaster, a whimpering whine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her,\nfeeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a\nsagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse's\nshadow floated ahead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing\nripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He\nheard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from\ncracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the\nthird-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the\njagged skylight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening\nto his creeping, implacable footfalls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he yelled and slammed open the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In\nthe corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like\na nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior,\nshredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the\nmoon-streaming skylight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He\nsnickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent's\ntongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten\ncloth.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that, baby?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won't know the\ndifference.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don't want—\" She began to cry. She\ncried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth\nopen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn't sound\nlike him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up\nat him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and\nshuffled away from her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and\nclutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't run. Please. Kill me! It'll be someone else if you don't. Oh,\nGod, I'm so tired waiting and running!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't, I can't!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,\nstudied Wayne with abstract interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you couldn't execute them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The psycho you only wounded. He's a five-times murderer. And that girl\nkilled her father when she was twelve. You realize there's nothing can\nbe done for them? That they have to be executed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Too bad,\" the doctor said. \"We all have aggressive impulses, primitive\nneeds that must be expressed early, purged. There's murder in all\nof us, Seton. The impulse shouldn't be denied or suppressed, but\n  <i>\n   educated\n  </i>\n  . The state used to kill them. Isn't it better all around,\nSeton, for us to do it, as part of growing up? What was the matter,\nSeton?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—felt sorry for her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is that all you can say about it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The doctor pressed a buzzer.

He didn't look up. \"I'm sorry I punked out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Give him the treatment,\" the doctor said wearily. \"And send him back\nto his mother.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wayne nodded and they led him away.

He bristles against the military authority figures at the youth center, deriding their appearance and position. Wayne is cocky and confident even as he is warned about the dangers of his mission. Wayne is assigned a mission that involves killing a known murderer and his girl. He has six hours of autonomy where he is privileged to operate outside of the normal rule of law.\n\nWayne makes his way to a rougher neighborhood and witnesses another teenager hunt down and brutally murder a vagrant with a baseball bat. Wayne enters the bar which contains his target. He locates and engages them, shooting the man and chasing the woman out of the bar into a crumbling apartment building.

Wayne however is overcome with a physical aversion to the violence he was intending to commit.\n\nWayne is later being evaluated back at the Youth Center. It is revealed that society engages teenagers to execute criminals as a preferred outlet for their aggressive impulses. Those that go through with an execution are initiated into the military.

Because he is 16, he is waiting for a draft call. His parents are worried about him, and suspect he has repressed some impulses to be violent, so they are a mix of relieved and concerned when Wayne tells them that he has received his call. Wayne takes the car that his parents were going to take for their night out, and heads toward the neon lights on the freeway. When he arrives at the Public Youth Center to check in for his draft call, he acts arrogantly to the sergeant at the reception desk. He heads to the armory to pick up two weapons: a Smith & Wesson .38, and a six-inch, spring-loaded Skelly switchblade. Afterwards, he heads to Captain Jack’s office. Captain Jack is the first person Wayne encounters in the story who makes him nervous. The Captain gives Wayne permission to go without curfew or law for six hours, and assigns him a task: a “beast” of a woman on the west side of town, at Four Aces Club, along with the man she is with. Wayne uses his signed pass to get past copy on his way there, driving through darker and darker streets, and  eventually makes it to the club. He ran into a drunk man who tried to ask Wayne for help, but some other teenagers pulled up a car, beat the man to death with a baseball bat, and split. Wayne disappeared into the club and caught eye of his targets. He was able to match the woman’s description to the outfit Captain Jack said she would be wearing, and Wayne sits at a nearby table, watching the woman get nervous. He orders a drink; after he downs it, he gets up, and his targets try to run. He shoots the man before they all run out of the club, chasing each other through alleys and a building that was falling apart. He eventually cornered the woman in a pieced-together bedroom, and she begged him to kill her quickly. She is so tired of running from people sent to kill her that she would like it to be over as quickly as possible. Wayne pulls out his belt to whip her with, but after he swings it once, he starts to retreat. The woman still begs for him to kill her, but his attitude has completely shifted and he insists that he cannot, and runs away. When Wayne goes back to the Youth Center, the doctor in charge of “readjustment” of teenagers scolds Wayne for not killing the woman, both because he believes the two targeted people are terrible people, but also because that means Wayne did not get the violent energy out of his system. The team is sent to receive treatment and be sent back home, and Wayne realizes that these nights end like this more often than he had realized.

It seems that Wayne likes to refer to things in casual ways, referring to the family car as a bolt bucket, and really takes the label of punk to heart when he is called that by Captain Jack. When Wayne arrives at the club where his targets are, the car that the other teenagers show up in is referred to as a Cad, presumably short for Cadillac. Another way language is used to delineate groups of people is in calling the hunted people beasts, and using animal imagery to describe them. The targets Wayne was after referred to as beasts, the woman as a mouse, and the man is a cat. This is one way these people are portrayed as less than human. Even during the chase, the woman is regularly referred to as a mouse, even as actual rats are running by as well.

It's times like this when we all need words, any\nwords, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about\nit. As for me—\" he twisted his glossy red face. \"Keeping alive is me\nhobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Click nodded. \"Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.\nIt's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and\nthe crash this way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far\ndown, and the green eyes blazed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stopped, together.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oops!\" Click said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" Marnagan blinked. \"Did you feel\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and\nlimbless, suddenly. \"Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They ran back. \"Let's try it again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.\n\"Gravity should not act this way, Click.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No\nwonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!\nGunther'd do anything to—did I say\n  <i>\n   anything\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand\ncame up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable\nhorrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with\nnumerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some\ntubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along\nin the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke\ncold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed\nafter him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in\nClick's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt\nthe creatures at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Irish!\" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline\ntoward the mouth a small cave. \"This way, fella!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. \"They're\ntoo big; they can't get us in here!\" Click's voice gasped it out,\nas Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.\nInstinctively, Hathaway added, \"Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a\nscene!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn your damn camera!\" yelled Marnagan. \"They might come in!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Use your gun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,\neh, Click?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. Sure.\n  <i>\n   You\n  </i>\n  enjoyed it, every moment of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I did that.\" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. \"Now, what\nwill we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let me think—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt\nfunny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters\nand Gunther and—\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which one will you be having?\" asked Irish, casually. \"A red one or a\nblue one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway laughed nervously. \"A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,\nnow you've got\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  doing it. Joking in the face of death.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That didn't please the photographer. \"I'm an Anglo-Swede,\" he pointed\nout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan shifted uneasily. \"Here, now. You're doing nothing but\nsitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take\nme a profile shot of the beasties and myself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. \"What in hell's the use? All\nthis swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while\nwaitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our\nrescue!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway snorted. \"U.S. Cavalry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he\nsaid. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,\nmy capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace\nnegotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver\nfor nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running\naround in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but\nhis mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of\nMarnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\nfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without\nmuch effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death\nwall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying\nanything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they\nhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\nup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\nback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\nwhat's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\nwar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\nis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which\ndispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\nSuper-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\nIt's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\nunseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan rumbled. \"Where is the dirty son, then!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them.\" Hathaway nodded at\nthe beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from\nwounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals\ntend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle\nhis attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the\nPatrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,\nthen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't see no Base around.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Click shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\na spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped\nit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it\ndeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing\nfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,\nleaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the\nimpressions. Quick stuff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,\nClick handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah,\nClick. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid\nmonsters complete.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:\nPictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally\nwith\n  <i>\n   nothing\n  </i>\n  ; Marnagan shooting his gun at\n  <i>\n   nothing\n  </i>\n  ; Marnagan\npretending to be happy in front of\n  <i>\n   nothing\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair\nlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.\nMaybe—\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this\nmess! Here—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,\nthe beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the\nmonsters weren't there, they weren't there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or\ninfra-red or something that won't come out on film?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nuts! Any color\n  <i>\n   we\n  </i>\n  see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, where\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  going?\" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man\ntried pushing past him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get out of the way,\" said Hathaway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. \"If anyone is going anywhere,\nit'll be me does the going.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't let you do that, Irish.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'd be going on my say-so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand\naside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their\nbones.\" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist\nexcept under an inch of porous metal plate. \"Your express purpose on\nthis voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later\nfor teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand\neducation. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me\nprofile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The\nLion's Den.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Irish, I—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up and load up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ready, Click?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—I guess so,\" said Hathaway. \"And remember, think it hard, Irish.\nThink it hard. There aren't any animals—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep me in focus, lad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All the way, Irish.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,\ntwo, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were\nwaiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right out into the middle of them....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the\nmonsters!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only now it was only Marnagan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No more monsters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. \"Hey, Click, look\nat me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and\nran away!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ran, hell!\" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and\nanimated. \"They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative\nfigments!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you\ncoward!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Smile when you say that, Irish.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in\nyour sweet grey eyes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn,\" swore the photographer, embarrassedly. \"Why don't they put\nwindow-wipers in these helmets?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll take it up with the Board, lad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one\nhunk, I couldn't help—Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part\nof his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back\ninto their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing\nsuspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals\nkill them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could\nhave frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If\nthat isn't being dangerous—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Irishman whistled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, we've got to\n  <i>\n   move\n  </i>\n  , Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.\nIn that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,\nGunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters.\" Click\nattached his camera to his mid-belt. \"Gunther probably thinks we're\ndead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never\nhad a chance to disbelieve them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident—\" Click\nstopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and\nfelt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady\nhimself, and swayed. \"I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.\nThis excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. \"Hold tight, Click. The\nguy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals\ncame from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come\nback!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come back? How?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we\nbelieve in them again, they'll return.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan didn't like it. \"Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if\nwe believe in 'em?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. \"Not if we believe\nin them to a\n  <i>\n   certain point\n  </i>\n  . Psychologically they can both be seen and\nfelt. We only want to\n  <i>\n   see\n  </i>\n  them coming at us again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Do\n  </i>\n  we, now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With twenty minutes left, maybe less—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. \"Just think—I will see\nthe monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.\nThink it over and over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. \"And—what if I forget to remember\nall that? What if I get excited...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at\nIrish.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan cursed. \"All right, lad. Let's have at it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The monsters returned.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming\nin malevolent anticipation about the two men.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a\nsending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted\nfaces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Marnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and\nraised his gun and made quick moves with it. \"Click! This one here!\nIt's real!\" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense\nframe slammed against rock, noiselessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the\nhelmet glass with his hands, shouting:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real—don't let it force into\nyour mind! It's not real, I tell you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Click—\" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.\n\"Click—\" He was fighting hard. \"I—I—sure now. Sure—\" He smiled.\n\"It—it's only a shanty fake!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan's thick lips opened. \"It's only a fake,\" he said. And then,\nirritated, \"Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and\nlittle bubbles danced in his eyes. \"Irish,\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  forget the monsters.\nLet me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might\nforget.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan showed his teeth. \"Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And\nbesides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.\nEvidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll be taking our chances on guard,\" hissed Irish. \"I'll go ahead,\ndraw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  show up with\n  <i>\n   your\n  </i>\n  gun....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I haven't got one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They\nprobably got scanners out. Let them see me—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about\nfive hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved\nup, and there was a door opening in the rock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. \"A\ndoor, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the\nthud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, put 'em up!\" a new harsh voice cried over a different\nradio. One of Gunther's guards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The strange harsh voice said, \"That's better. Don't try and pick that\ngun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.\nHow'd you get past the animals?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Click started running. He switched off his\n  <i>\n   sending\n  </i>\n  audio, kept his\n  <i>\n   receiving\n  </i>\n  on. Marnagan, weaponless.\n  <i>\n   One\n  </i>\n  guard. Click gasped. Things\nwere getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running\nand listening to Marnagan's lying voice:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles\nand stacked them up to dry, ya louse!\" Marnagan said. \"But, damn you,\nthey killed my partner before he had a chance!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard laughed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head\nswimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He\nlet himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't\nhave a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that\nyellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,\nair hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a\nproton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard\nhad his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: \"I think I'll let\nyou stand right there and die,\" he said quietly. \"That what Gunther\nwanted, anway. A nice sordid death.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't move!\" he snapped. \"I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One\ntwitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind\nyou! Freeze!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped\nhis gun to the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get his gun, Irish.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. \"Thanks for\nposing,\" he said. \"That shot will go down in film history for candid\nacting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door\nleading into the Base?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.\n\"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double\ntime! Double!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on\ntheir backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,\nhid him in a huge trash receptacle. \"Where he belongs,\" observed Irish\ntersely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing\nmore than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.\nPerfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was\nshort-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to\nrocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for\ncargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the\nswarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't\nwanted. They were scared off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of\nintricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film\nwith images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them\ninto thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So here we are, still not much better off than we were,\" growled\nIrish. \"We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn\nup any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the\nmonsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What good would that do?\" Hathaway gnawed his lip. \"They wouldn't fool\nthe engineers who created them, you nut.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. \"Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come\nriding over the hill—\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Irish!\" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. \"Irish. The U.S.\nCavalry it is!\" His eyes darted over the machines. \"Here. Help me.\nWe'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marnagan winced. \"You breathing oxygen or whiskey?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture\nof Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face\nwhen you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an\nactor are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's a silly question.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of\nyou, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart\nand fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down\nand twitch on the ground. Is that clear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a\nsort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,\nlined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a\nwide, green-lawned Plaza.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked\nacross the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that\nwas pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and\npushed him into a room where Gunther sat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The\npirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,\nquestioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of\nmetal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he\ncould speak, Hathaway said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and\nwe're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men\nagainst your eighty-five.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands\ntwitched in his lap. \"You are bluffing,\" he said, finally, with a firm\ndirectness. \"A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the\nlast. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being\npursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Both.

Marnagan states that they could walk the entire diameter of the planet they are on in four hours, but Hathaway points out that he has only an hour of oxygen.  Hathaway states that he has photo evidence that the meteor that hit their ship was thrown at them, probably by Gunther, the person Marnagan is trying to capture, but Marnagan redirects their priorities to oxygen, food, and a way back to earth.\n\nAs they walk in search of help, they notice that there is human-made gravity on the planet.  Immediately after making that discovery, they encounter an enormous herd of dangerous beasts.  When Marnagan discovers his gun is ineffective as a weapon, they flee to a nearby cave for protection, as the cave is too small for the beasts to enter.\n\nMarnagan asks Hathaway to take a picture of him with the beasts.  Hathaway snaps several pictures of Marnagan posing at a safe distance.  Hathaway then says that between the “natural” meteors, gravity, and beasts, their crash will look accidental rather than like murder.  He shows Marnagan the pictures he shot, intending to use the beasts as part of his argument, but Marnagan protests that his film is “lousy” as only Marnagan, appears in the shots and not the beasts.  When Hathaway confirms this is so, he is insistent that the film cannot lie.  If the beasts do not appear in the photos, they don’t exist.\n\nWhen they emerge from the cave and the animals are gone, the men are at first elated.

Marnagan believes he is being attacked by a beast, but when Hathaway reminds him the monsters are fake, Marnagan is able to resist the telepathic message.

The ship splits open, so there is no way for them to leave the asteroid. They both have 60 minutes of oxygen remaining. At first, they think the meteor was an accident, but then Hathaway remembers that it was red-hot and glowing before it struck them, and he knows that meteors in space are never glowing hot. Hathaway is convinced that Gunther lobbed the meteor at them to make them crash. As they begin walking on the surface of the meteor, they notice a change in the gravity in one place and realize that they have stumbled upon Gunther’s hideout. Then a horde of monsters comes charging at them, making Hathaway and Marnagan run for their lives and hide in a small cave. Marnagan fires his gun at the beasts, but it does not affect them.\n\nMarnagan has Hathaway film him facing the beasts. Hathaway has invented a film that develops itself when exposed to light.

Click realizes they have an hour left in their oxygen supplies, so they set about to find food, air, and a way to return to Earth. Click suspects the crash was engineered by Gunther himself. As they walk along the meteor, they begin to realize gravity behaves strangely there, and Click wonders if that, too, has been engineered by Gunther. Before he can think on this too deeply, they encounter a horde of monsters of all shapes and sizes coming for them over a hill. Marnagan shoots at them, but they are immune to his shots. Marnagan and Click hide in a nearby cave to hatch a plan. Marnagan poses for some pictures pretending to battle the monsters. Click posits a theory that the strange gravity and meteor attack they’d encountered earlier was Gunther’s way of crashing ships on his asteroid—an effective weapon in an age with primitive space-battle weaponry and a good way to gather supplies while being short on crew. The monsters had been sent to finish the job. When they sit down to examine Click’s footage, they see that there are no monsters in any of the shots. This leads Click to develop another theory—if the monsters weren’t really there, then neither were they! Marnagan tests his theory by walking out of the cave into the middle of the monsters. Because he believes they do not exist, they vanish completely, and the two men realize Gunther’s plan to scare to death anyone who might happen upon his asteroid. At the same time, they are running out of oxygen, and Click says they must bring the monsters back in order to follow them back to Gunther’s base.

After the crash, Hathaway is more concerned with taking photos of Marnagan emerging from the crash than helping him emerge from the rubble, not because he doesn’t care about his companion, but because he sees his companion as so strong, it doesn’t occur to him to be concerned for his physical safety.  This points to one of their key differences--while Marnagan is immediately concerned for Hathaway’s safety and assumes Hathaway would reciprocate, Hathaway sees Marnagan as much stronger than himself, nearly invulnerable.\n\nWe see Hathaway and Marnagan’s collaborative relationship continue when they are faced with the beasts.  They are both afraid; Hathaway is the first to spot the secure hiding place of the cave and hails Marnagan to run there.  Marnagan then proposes that he pose “with” the beasts--standing at a safe distance with them in the background--and Hathaway agrees.  They continue to argue about what to do while Hathaway develops the film as part of his argument.  When Hathaway presents the developed film as evidence, Marnagan teases him about his invention being “lousy”, as only he (Marnagan) shows in the photos, but the monsters do not.  This joke sets up Hathaway’s realization that the beasts are telepathic projections rather than physical beings, leading the men to debate which of them will lead the hunt for oxygen.  While Hathaway knows his partner is physically stronger and he is already suffering from oxygen deprivation, he doesn’t want to risk Marnagan’s safety if his deduction proves wrong.  Marnagan, however, shows his trust in Hathaway by insisting that he (Marnagan) lead, confident that if Hathaway says the monsters aren’t there, they are indeed not.\n\nWhen Marnagan briefly succumbs to the telepathic illusion of the beasts, Hathaway is able to talk him down.  Just by listening to Hathaway’s words, Marnagan is able to convince himself again that the beasts are not real.  Marnagan then convinces the guard he encounters that Hathaway died in the ship crash, allowing Hathaway to sneak in, capture the guard, and get both the men oxygen.  They use their teamwork in a last instance to defeat the principal antagonist of the story, Gunther.  Hathaway is captured by more of Gunther’s guards and taken to him, but is already prepared.  He shows Gunther that Gunther’s men are being overwhelmed and defeated by five hundred armed Patrol men, causing Gunther to pull out a weapon and fire wildly until Hathaway knocks him unconscious.

For this reason, it remains unaffected by telepathy--it can only record what is there, not what is projected into the mind.\n\nHathaway and Marnagan become trapped in a small cave by what they believe are dangerous wild beasts.  Marnagan asks Hathaway to take his pictures as Marnagan poses against the backdrop of the beasts.  When Marnagan looks at the photos and complains that the beasts do not appear, Hathaway realizes that the beasts are not physically real, but only telepathic projections in the men's minds.  He and Marnagan are then able to dismiss the beasts and bring them back at will in order to let the projections lead them to their source.\n\nTelepathy plays a significant role again when Hathaway and Marnagan formulate a plan to capture Gunther, the person Marnagan is on a mission to capture and the man that caused their crash.  While the two of them could easily overpower Gunther if he were alone, there are at least fifty guards with him at his base.  Hathaway realizes they can photograph Marnagan in poses as though he's taking over the base and use those images in the telepathic projector against the guards and Gunther.  The telepathic projector turns one Marnagan into five hundred, allowing the two men to easily capture the base and Gunther while the guards flee.  The guards are likely aware of the telepathic projectors, but do not suspect that Hathaway and Marnagan have managed to turn the projectors to their own ends.  By using the projectors, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to turn a very dangerous situation into an easy victory.

This impression frightens people whose spaceships crash onto the asteroid so that they will be too afraid to search for the hideout of Gunther and his guards. Hathaway realizes that the monsters are simply images that disappear when people no longer believe they are real when he examines his film of Marnagan with the monsters in the background. When he reviews his film, only Marnagan is visible, so Hathaway realizes that the monsters are not real. Gunther’s telepathic projectors protect him and his men; he needs this added protection because he only has a few men, and Gunther himself is old and crippled, unable to defend himself or move on his own. Just as the telepathic projectors give him protection, they are also his undoing at the end of the story when Hathaway and Marnagan use the projectors against him. They feed in a film that makes it look like 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen are marching toward Gunter’s headquarters, but in reality, it’s only Marnagan with his image reproduced 499 times.

This turns out to be true, and they are able to make their way to Gunther’s hideaway, where they find oxygen tanks to support them in their next steps. By commandeering use of the projectors for their own purposes, Marnagan and Click are able to trick Gunther’s men into believing Marnagan is the 500-men Patrol come to capture Gunther and defeat his ranks.

Flowers,\n  <br/>\n  had stumbled onto a murderous plot more\n  <br/>\n  hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.\n  <br/>\n  And the danger from the villain of the piece\n  <br/>\n  didn't worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the\n  <i>\n   Spacemen's Club\n  </i>\n  in Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\nshoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\nthee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A woman here...! The\n  <i>\n   Spacemen's\n  </i>\n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie!\n </p>\n <p>\n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n  <i>\n   Spacemen's\n  </i>\n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened to\n  <i>\n   Guns for Ganymede\n  </i>\n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't\n  <i>\n   Guns\n  </i>\n  , it was\n  <i>\n   Pistols\n  </i>\n  ; and it wasn't\n  <i>\n   Ganymede\n  </i>\n  , it was\n  <i>\n   Pluto\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\n  <i>\n   Satellite\n  </i>\n  Theater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\n  <i>\n   Satellite\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\n  <i>\n   zilcon\n  </i>\n  wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In front was a big sign. It read:\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n  <br/>\n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n  <br/>\n  NINE GENIUSES\n  <br/>\n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n  <br/>\n  THE SYSTEM\n </p>\n <p>\n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\nadvanced to the footlights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\nmyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a roar of applause from the\n  <i>\n   Satellite\n  </i>\n  audience. When it had\nsubsided, the man continued:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\nto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\nnine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\nsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\nThese questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\nquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\n  <i>\n   planetoles\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\nher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\nscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\non the dais.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\ndials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\ncoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\nvoice echoed through the theater:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\nhand. She said quietly:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\ntracto-car.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\nthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\ncafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\nbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\nor when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\nthe winner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\nbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The audience in the\n  <i>\n   Satellite\n  </i>\n  seemed to have lost much of its\noriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\nsignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\ngeneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\nwere turned in a smile of satisfaction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\ncrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\noccurred.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\ndragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\nunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\nthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\nan earlier era.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\nman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\nwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\nsnipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\ninto his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\nrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\nshout derisive epithets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\nand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\nTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\nwas all but deserted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\neyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men\nought to clamp down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The I.P. men aren't strong enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\nline about her usually smiling lips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My last book,\n  <i>\n   Death In The Atom\n  </i>\n  , hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who?\" I interrupted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n  <i>\n   Alpha\n  </i>\n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n  <i>\n   Gamma\n  </i>\n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n  <i>\n   Beta\n  </i>\n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When any form of life is exposed to these\n  <i>\n   Gamma\n  </i>\n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n  <i>\n   en masse\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Zinnng-whack!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A heat ray!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had traveled this far by\n  <i>\n   ganet\n  </i>\n  , the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\n  <i>\n   jagua\n  </i>\n  canoes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stand still!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then that would mean...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\n  <i>\n   varpa\n  </i>\n  cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dangerous?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Half an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\nwere ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\ncamped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\nabout us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\ndespondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\nfutility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\nfrom turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\nthat all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\nsteaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\nadvance on foot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\nsuddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\nThere it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened\n  <i>\n   arelium\n  </i>\n  steel,\nhalf buried in the swamp soil.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\nquarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\nsuspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\ninsulators.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\nVenusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\ncircle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\nMoments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\nMid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\nclimb slowly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\nThere was no sign of life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\nleft side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\nbare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\nclarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\nlooked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\nswing slowly to and fro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\nthe lower hold are probably exposed to a\n  <i>\n   tholpane\n  </i>\n  plate and their\nradiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\nglass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\natomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\nguards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the\nGreen Flames are more accessible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\nthe feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\nvessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\nSuspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\nplate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie stamped her foot. \"It's maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\nthe crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single\nmove.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently\nunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire\nand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding\ndesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this\ntime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe\nand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of\nthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe\nprogram.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once,\nbut I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought\nto make him king or somethin'.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped\nto her feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say that again!\" she cried.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to\nmake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness\nand returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a\nmethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's\nhold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such\na way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.\nDon't you see?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames\nradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The\nDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but\nthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations\nfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and\ntheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic\nscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial\ncontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,\nDoctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the\nminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'\nradiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the\ntents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had\ndropped away to be replaced by another.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the\nimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And\nsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the\nold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was\nfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.\nOpposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar\npunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our\nonly escape is to make 'em laugh!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.\nAbruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped\nand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping\njack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen\nblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild\nlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes\nfilled with excitement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop\nDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.\nRight now we're nicely bottled up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz\nmaster on the screen. He was saying:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of\nunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow\nnight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the\nVenusians.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled\nup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship\nwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled\nthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.\nNext she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought\nalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.\nShe fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every\ntwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and\nfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she\nselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity\nof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and\nout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At length she finished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll\ntell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow\nnight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme\ndictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this ship\nunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast—the laughing\nof the Varsoom!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're going to what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.\nVisualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universe\nmakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wild\npeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar\nPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that\nmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly\ntried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter\nsilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the\nscheduled Doctor Universe program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. \"Maybe we've got\nto attract their attention first,\" he suggested. \"Miss Flowers, why\ndon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something from\none of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit\nup and take notice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to her\nfeet quickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll do it,\" she said. \"I'll read them the attack scene from\n  <i>\n   Murder\nOn A Space Liner\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It didn't make sense, of course. But nothing made sense in this mad\nventure. Grannie Annie opened her duffel bag and drew out a copy of\nher most popular book. With the volume under her arm, she mounted the\nladder to the top of the envelope. Ezra Karn rigged up a radite search\nlamp, and a moment later the old woman stood in the center of a circle\nof white radiance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karn gripped my arm. \"This is it,\" he said tensely. \"If this fails ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice clipped off as Grannie began to read. She read slowly\nat first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and more\ndramatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"...\n  <i>\n   the space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shot\nfrom the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the control\ncabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to free\nhimself. Opposite him, lashed by strong Martian vinta ropes to the\ngravascope, Louise Belmont sobbed softly, wringing her hands in mute\nappeal.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A restless rustling sounded out in the marsh, as if hundreds of bodies\nwere surging closer. Karn nodded in awe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's got 'em!\" he whispered. \"Listen. They're eatin' up every word.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I heard it then, and I thought I must be dreaming. From somewhere out\nin the swamp a sound rose into the thick air. A high-pitched chuckle,\nit was. The chuckle came again. Now it was followed by another and\nanother. An instant later a wave of low subdued laughter rose into the\nair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ezra Karn gulped. \"Gripes!\" he said. \"They're laughing already.\n  <i>\n   They're laughing at her book!\n  </i>\n  And look, the old lady's gettin' sore.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up on the roof of the envelope Grannie Annie halted her reading to\nglare savagely out into the darkness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The laughter was a roar now. It rose louder and louder, peal after peal\nof mirthful yells and hysterical shouts. And for the first time in my\nlife, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shook\nher fist at the unseen hordes out before her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ignorant slap-happy fools!\" she screamed. \"You don't know good science\nfiction when you hear it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned to Karn and said quietly, \"Turn on the visi set. Doctor\nUniverse should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull in\nas much of that laughter as you can.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City. The Varsoom\nfollowed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen\narmy in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did\nthe last chuckle fade into the distance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently\nout before her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all\nsides.

Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people’s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show.

The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra’s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show.

The hot, throbbing rumble\nwhipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\nthe universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\nchance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\nthrobbing rumble changed tone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.\n\"Well, Mr. O'Rielly?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\nBurner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn't you lock them controls before\nblast-off?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,\" O'Rielly\nanswered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\nregistered before blast-off—wouldn't it, sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know yet, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\nthis ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a\nhundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly\nin pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\nhad moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\nEarth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\nthrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\naboard gone in a churning cloud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\nthe thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any\nmore? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\nroom. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\nand a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner\nChief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\nofficers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch\nroom. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\nBy now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\ninquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\nmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly\nsaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\nsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\nhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\nthat way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\neither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\nO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\nof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I\ncouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.\nSo I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\nnaturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned\nresetting the control.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\nuntil she couldn't sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\nwhere no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\nbreath against woman's supremacy in all matters. That male character\ntrait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\nO'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one's person, heard\nhimself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\nthat bother to get out here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're so kind. But I'm afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\nthere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume!

Oh, let me open it for you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\nthat O'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\nher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\nin his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\nwhen he'd been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\nhad a jug to cheer one's parting with one's money.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\nflashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\nbuzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\nwhat about that control?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What control?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, that little thing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'Rielly\nsharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\nLemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\nagain probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly said while bowing\ngracefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Higher than a swacked skunk's tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\nsnapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\nBurner Chief Terrence Callahan's mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody's,\nwould be improved by knowledge of she who was in O'Rielly's shower now.\nNot that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\nOh, very quite!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn't I tell you\nto shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman's taking a Venus bigwig\non tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\nshe'll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she'll do anyway\nabout your fusion control!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\nbeen thinking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\nmyself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O'Rielly's shower\ndoor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Venus dames,\" O'Rielly said dreamily, \"don't boss anything, do they?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Callahan yelped like he'd been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\n\"O'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\nCallahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\nposition; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\nhave overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan's eyes rolled like the\ndevil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O'Rielly, open your big ears\nwhilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\ngot one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\neverybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\nit. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\nthe shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\nfamily—everything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, that's when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\nwith knots in their tails. Before the guys who'd brought the Venus\ndames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\npick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones\nback where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on\nEarth again there wouldn't be enough left of Venus to find with an\nelectron microscope.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\nnotions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in an\natom's eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.\nCrazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million\nlight years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\ndeal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\nstay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave\nVenus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught\naround a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything\nat bargain basement prices.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O'Rielly said, still\ndreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pray heaven you'll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten\nfoot of you! Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn't\nmake a whit difference—you'd still act sappier than thirty-seven\nangels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. \"Holy\nhollering saints!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded with an airy\nlaugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\nlived to tell it, has he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\ninto his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O'Rielly snorted.\n\"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\n\"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough to\nstuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags,\neven through customs? Just run 'em through the big Geiger that tells\nwhether there's any fusionable junk inside.

What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look! I was\na full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\ntwenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more,\nyou hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could\nput your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't high\non vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we\nfeed the Old Woman?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!\nAwp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at\nleast!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.\nOld Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway\nwas saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\nlovely neck and his own forever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not\nopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\nhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n </p>\n <p>\n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\nwas being slapped together again. \"O'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\npirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\nyou don't have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\ndon't flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\na zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\nO'Rielly's shower.\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\nTrillium. Just like that, O'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\nspiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\nthe doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\nand coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\nTrillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\nship. O'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don't you\nworry about another thing!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I'm not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\nway Grandmamma knew it would!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly's shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\nbounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\ndon't tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\nto know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The watch room's door had opened. Wouldn't think the Old Woman was a\nday over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\nprobably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\nFrosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\nlooked at O'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\nerect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\nrobed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\nlesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\nfrom his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\nof two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\nyou a question, did I not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Believe you did, ma'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\nanswer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was\ndiscussing—ah—matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly\nhere is considering it, ma'am.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\nideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of before in his life.\nYes, ma'am!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman's look was fit to\nfreeze O'Rielly's brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\ndown here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, you'll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma'am!\"\nCallahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\nwomen—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\nthe control phenomenon, ma'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\nBurnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\nsaid with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed 'twouldn't\nbother me none if there wasn't one of the things left in the world!\nPresent company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\ncourtly bow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face,\nthen in O'Rielly's vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\nshe muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\nhorrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\nagain. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for?\nThen use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\nburner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\nme, Your Excellency?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as\nhe might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\never told any Venus man what to do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\nsteps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\nblowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\ndoor, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\nof person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\nExcellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\nsweat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\nfirst, Your Excellency.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\n\"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\nWoman, a prime symbol of her gender's superiority, whipped a razor edge\nonto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain's quarters are more\nsatisfactory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave\nO'Rielly's watch room. Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from busting\nout laughing for joy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And\nbetwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd be\nhappy forever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and\nyanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of\ncourse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the\nsabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trillium,\" O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to\nkeep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladly\ndrowned himself if he could.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of\nouter space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and for\nher leaving her planet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up!\" His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight out\nsideways. \"I'll handle this!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent\nEarth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard\nback to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President\nof Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled\nat that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at\nO'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan\nlooked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness and\nprotect it to his last breath of life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.\nPanels on opposite walls lit up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\n\"Interplanetary emergency.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally\npleasant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious war\nefforts.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship.\nStowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a\nblizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The\nfacts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,\nthat were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My\nown granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his\nExcellency, \"what's this nonsense?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with\nannoyance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\n\"Some silly female cackling now!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one's left hand on a\ndesk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by\nthose two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by\nmyself, and Mr. O'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President's ear beards stood near straight up\nas he roared, \"You couldn't have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,\ntell the truth!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged,\" His\nExcellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the first\nthing about such things!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I've been married to her\nfor a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finest\nrattle-brain I ever knew!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five\nyears ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling\nvolcano. \"The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....\nBerta? Impossible!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Madame President's shapely finger now rested full on the button that\ncould launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a\nthousand years. \"I'm afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame\nPresident stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter's actions have every mark\nof an invasion tactic by your government.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President's finger now lay\npoised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow\nEarth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under\nyour official command!

His ear beards, however, still had\nenough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\nlove only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\nworks.

The story begins when his supervisor, Burner Chief Callahan, alerts O’Rielly that one of the controls on his burner has slipped, so he sets about resetting the controls to prevent the ship from crashing when it starts its descent toward Earth. He searches his watch room and around the burner looking for a mouse or anyone who might have moved the control. He thinks about Captain Millicent Hatwoody, the ship’s commander nicknamed “Old Woman”, and worries she will exile him to a distant moon if she discovers the issue. During his search, he discovers a stowaway Venusian woman named Trillium on his bunk bed, and she tells him she had moved the control in order to escape the burner room where she was hiding. O’Rielly is struck by her beauty and allows her to shower in his bathroom. While she is showering, Callahan to interrogate O’Rielly and instructs him to take a shower because Captain Hatwoody is bringing a guest to tour the facilities. He reminds O’Rielly of the history of the Earth women’s supremacy over men, which began as a response to the Earth men’s infatuation with Venusian women. When they established dominance, the Earth women returned the Venusian women to their planet. Consequently, the Venusian men warned of war if any Earth men attempted to contact Venusian women. For their part, Venusian women would be killed if they tried to leave. To soften the threat, Venus agreed to let Earth purchase products at a lower cost. O’Rielly reminds Callahan that no Earth man has seen a Venusian woman in 125 years, and Callahan tells the story—an Earth man disguised himself as a Venusian in order to visit his love, a Venusian woman named Berta. When Trillium returns, she reveals that she is Berta’s granddaughter. She hides again before Captain Hatwoody arrives. The captain and her guest, a Venusian ambassador named Dimdooly, investigate the burner, and their interactions reveal conflicting attitudes towards gender superiority on Earth versus Venus. As they leave, Trillium reveals herself, and Dimdooly recognizes her as the Venusian president’s granddaughter. Captain Hatwoody then calls the presidents of both planets, who begin to blame each other and threaten war. Trillium explains that it was Berta, the president’s wife, who taught her how to stowaway, as she had done so herself 125 years prior. She reveals her purpose for stowing away was to draw attention to her revolutionary vision—to convince Earth to stop purchasing products from Venus, thus stopping their cash flow to fund wars. She explains the wars distract Venusian men, and that is why the women are attracted to Earth men. While the president balks, his wife orders him to step aside as she has been elected new President of Venus, and the Venusian women are taking over. Trillium is rewarded with Dimdooly’s ambassadorship, and Callahan and O’Rielly are sent back to work.

O’Rielly does not view women of power with respect, but he treats this woman differently and is attracted to her. There is a gender-based arrangement where women from Venus are no longer allowed on Earth, so her presence is highly illegal.\n\nCallahan (O’Rielly’s superior) comes into the room and discovers the woman from Venus, thinking she is named Berta.

Trillium seems to want to be found, and is soon revealed to the ship’s Captain, Millicent Hatwoody, and an ambassador from Venus, Dimdooly. Hatwoody alerts the presidents of both Earth and Venus to the situation, and they disagree about what has happened and whose fault it is. The president of Earth thinks Trillium stowing away on an Earth vessel is tantamount to an act of war, while the president of Venus (Trillium’s grandfather) thinks she must have been kidnapped by the Earth men on the ship.\n\nTrillium clarifies that she intentionally stowed away, with help from her grandmother, Berta, in order to ask the president of Earth to stop buying anything from Venus. The women of Venus want the men to stop leaving to fight in wars that the male-dominated government make up reasons to start just to keep the men occupied, and they want Earth to stop funding the wars. As her grandfather is telling Trillium that things are going to stay as they are, the Earth president says she has dissolved all trade with Venus, and Berta enters her husband’s office and announces that the women of Venus have unanimously voted for Berta to take over the presidency and women to unseat the men from power.

When he returns to his watch room, a beautiful woman from Venus is on his bunk. She explains that she changed the setting because she was in the burner room and couldn’t open the door when it grew too warm for her. \n\nO’Rielly’s superior, Chief Callahan, arrives to see what caused the problem. Callahan discovers the woman from Venus. He reminds O’Rielly that the first flight from Earth to Venus was made one thousand years ago, and the men from Earth immediately fell in love with the women from Venus and brought some of them back to Earth. Women on Earth were angered by the Earthmen’s behaviors and took over the control of Earth. They took the Venus women back to Venus and warned that there would be a war if any of them came back to Earth. The last time an Earthman was near a Venus woman was 125 years ago when he stuffed himself into a luggage bag and made himself a pair of fake ear beards with worms in them to make them move so he could pass himself off as a Venus man. \n\nThe girl from Venus steps out of the shower, and Callahan calls her “Berta,” but she says her name is “Trillium” and that her grandmother’s name is Berta. Trillium is said to look just as Berta did 125 years ago. O’Rielly hides Trillium under his cot just before Captain Hatwoody enters to check on the burner problem. She is also escorting the Dimdooly, the Personal Assistant of the President of Venus, on a ship tour. Just as the Ambassador and Hatwoody are leaving, Trillium makes a loud bump, and they discover her. The Ambassador is certain she has been kidnapped, but Trillium explains that she stowed away.\n\nHatwoody takes everyone to her office where she calls the presidents of both Earth and Venus. The president of Venus is Trillium’s grandfather. He says she couldn’t have stolen away on her own and demands the truth, so she explains that her grandmother, his wife, told her how to do it. Trillium explains she stowed away to bring the cause of the Venus women to Earth’s attention. She wants Earth to stop trading with Venus so that Venus won’t have the money to keep sending its men to wars for all but two weeks every year. The Venus president’s wife interrupts and declares she’s taking over the presidency; she orders her women to take her husband away and appoints Trillium her new ambassador. O’Rielly realizes Callahan was the last Earthman to meet a Venus woman in person and was the one who tried to stow away to Venus.

He looked out across the\nheaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly\naround at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and\nstarted toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully\nbecause of the lesser gravitation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig was shorter than the average Earthman—although on Ortha he\nwas well above the average in height—but his body was thick and\npowerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features\nwere regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were\na curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore\nno garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his\nrod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the\nlittle-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to\nwait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to\nbring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space\ncruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's\nmentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a\nplanet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them\nall only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,\nhowever, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every\nrespect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope\nmade of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a\nleafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered\nwith baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal\nand wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's\nstupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished\nmetal at the reflection of himself!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious\ntime. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the\nintervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped\nacross the mouth and neck of the stranger....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had\nground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid\ndesolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was\ngoing stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that\nshiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly\nhe had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't\ndared touch the machine since.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never\nbeen further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised\nhis wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on\na trailer tour of the\n  <i>\n   West\n  </i>\n  that very summer. Since that promise, he\ncould not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and\nbe-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out\nof his subconscious. Yet he\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  to write at least three novelets and\na fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great\nadventure—or the trip was off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed\nfor his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a\nsalable yarn....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the\nroad. \"What's the trouble?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the\nstranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech\nand his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand\nclamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of\nhis head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured\nEarthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that\nmust have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he\nwears he might be Thig.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we\nwill transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to\nthe brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without\narousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the\ntwo inner planets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear\nthese clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use\nof our limbs so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling\nout his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that\nyou disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted\nTerry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully\ncultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they\nknew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely\nlacking in their early training and later life. They were trained\nantlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde\nwere of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling\nrobots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,\ntheir love-life, their everything!\n </p>\n <p>\n  So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped\non two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to\none another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their\nheads.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain\ndry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman\nproved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped\ncompletely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his\nbody and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured\nbrain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.\n\"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new\nbody must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is\naroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming\nbaubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and\npainless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship\nand set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running\ninland to his home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood\nmemories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place\nwhere Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that\nold 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of\nthat episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his\npocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on\nthe sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little\nEarth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his\nacquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from\naround his heart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the\ndead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men\nhad no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other\nprimitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding\nthe emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,\ntrembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked\nachingly up into his throat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called\nup at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that\nSaddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"\nand three other editors asked for shorts soon.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had\nhe acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously\nadopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this\nway, he realized—more natural.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the\nglittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used\nto hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing\nbut a handful of these.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung,\nunbelieving, to his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new\ntrailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right\naway.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages\nand gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he\nhoped that the west had reformed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm\nwarming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from\nthe Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks\nlater and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt\nbeside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went\non as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as\nbeautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the\nexposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car\nand the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living\nquarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the\nchaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows\nand report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,\nincluding Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force\nto wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,\nof course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be\nlanded. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,\nimperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the\nHordes?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the\ndead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three\nmonths he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed\nfor reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady\nglory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had\nexperienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against\nthe wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt\ndivision of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer\nthought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty\nadded zest to every day's life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to\nthe Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,\nwould one new world—or a hundred—populated by the Hordes add to\nthe progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan\ncivilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain\nwell-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast\nmechanical hives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had\ncaught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath\nthem. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid\nred the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and\ncactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,\nwho nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept—the son\nof Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better\nof his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to\nblast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the\nroad toward the beach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly\nbut they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the\ndoor and called after him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she\nwould have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of\nperson when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a\nhand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the\nautumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that\nlived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked\nin the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the\ncareless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be\nsapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never\nbe written, but he toyed with the idea.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from\nthe unquestioning worship of the Horde!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report\non the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now\nhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to\nOrtha at once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the\ncomplete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations\nof the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they\nwere permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that\nthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient\nfor the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and\nexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for\nexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once\na race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own\ndegree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a\nrace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way\nof a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The\nLaw of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.\n\"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.\nThere are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long\nforgotten.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His\nwords are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this\nworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the\nsquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments\nand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the\nwalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of\na decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of\nthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or\nvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble\nclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's\nbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly\nhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children\nof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must\nstand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an\nempty world—this planet was not for them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a\nwoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need\nthis planet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its\ncase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac\nof the finest members of the Horde.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.\n\"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we\nmust eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick\njaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying\nthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into\nKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it\ncould be uttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness\nand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and\nfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly\nstruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand\nfought against that lone arm of Thig.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his\nweapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig\nsuddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden\nreversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling\nabout full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down\nupon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the\ndecomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul\ncorruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated\nmatter. Horror for what he had done—that he had slain one of his own\nHorde—made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled\nfor the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the\ncontrol blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the\nnarrowed icy eyes of his commander.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his\nskull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.\nHis body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited\nstupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all\nthe struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy\nyarn—they would all be dead anyhow soon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly\ntoward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp\nwould ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon\nupon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a\nhammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He\nwas in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of\nbruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon\nhis skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed\nhim with those savage blows upon the head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his\nancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now\nowed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently\nused the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his\nunconscious body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control\nroom. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies\nthrough the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered\nwhy he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures\nof his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible\nfor his sudden madness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association\nof memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack\nbeneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the\nweapon. He tugged it free.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck\ntoward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,\nthe metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp\nscuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled\nout into a senseless whinny.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length\nof the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared\nfull into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there\nwatching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten\nlips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and\nchest. He was a madman!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and\nnow the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all\nserved to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.\nThe shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of\nthe Orthan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad\nstare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over\nthe skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that\nvictory had given him to drive him along.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought\nsobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After\nall, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking\nof while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and\nread the last few nervously scrawled lines:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that\nstrikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent\nthere. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and\ndestroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.\nAlready I feel the insidious virus of....\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there his writing ended abruptly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the\nplanet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's\npath she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger\non 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of\na half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's\nhull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving\nhim from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new\nbody was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the\nemotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months\nbefore, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the\nrockets driving him from the parent ship.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the\ngreat exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no\nregret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first\nexistence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the\nmonotonous routine of existence that had once been his—and his heart\nthrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days\nhe had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a\ntiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The\nrocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching\nthe ship echoed through the hull-plates.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the\nroundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion\nthat all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his\nrockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that\ncrowded his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time\nhe had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys\nbelow. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,\ndespite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer\nspace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight\ndifferences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers\ntrembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said\na brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very\ndeeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories\nwere hot, bitter pains.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world.

He begins to feel new sensations and emotions around Terry’s wife, Ellen, and their kids, and travels with them on a three-month vacation during which he learns what it feels like to be human and to care for a family. When they return and he must make his report to the other Orthans, he truthfully reports that Earth would be ideal to take over but has second thoughts when Torp says he’ll recommend that they conquer Earth and decimate the population. When his pleas to consider just disarming and exiling the humans are met with scorn, Thig becomes angry and ultimately realizes that he loves Ellen and wants to go back to save Earth. He kills both of his Orthan colleagues and sends the ship back toward Ortha as he takes an auxiliary ship back to Long Island. Along the way, he experiences many emotions including regret for his former callousness and taking Lewis Terry away from his family. Instead of the robotic being who initially exhibited coldness and indifference at the beginning of the story, he now experiences remorse and selflessness as he decides to give Ellen and the kids the life they deserve even though he’ll always know who he is and what he has done.

But Joe Mallon, with\nno dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of land\nthat had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontifically\ninto the battered metalloy saloon—the only one on Planetoid 42—his\ntall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing something\nincoherent. They met in the doorway, violently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're delirious!\" Joe cried. \"It's a mirage!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is?\" asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared,\nspeechless for once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea\npurveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had\nthey seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two\nhands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the\nremaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish\nHarvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this\nimpossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit\njuice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nonsense,\" Harvey croaked uncertainly. \"We have seen enough queer\nthings to know there are always more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:\n\"Water—quick!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out\ntwo glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked\nfor more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartender\nhad taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water so\nfast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender's\nimpersonal eyes studying them shrewdly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Strangers, eh?\" he asked at last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,\" Harvey answered in his usual\nlush manner. \"We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,\n  <i>\n   La-anago\nYergis\n  </i>\n  , the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in\nthe ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in\nproclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history\nof therapeutics.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah?\" said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser\nglasses without washing them. \"Where you heading?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gone\nwithout water for five ghastly days.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?\" Joe asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't land\nhere unless they're in trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mayor takes care of that,\" replied the saloon owner. \"If you gents're\nfinished at the bar, your drinks'll be forty buckos.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey grinned puzzledly. \"We didn't take any whiskey.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Might as well. Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with every\nchaser.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. \"That—that's robbery!\" the lanky man\nmanaged to get out in a thin quaver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain't many customers, you gotta\nmake more on each one. Besides—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Besides nothing!\" Joe roared, finding his voice again. \"You dirty\ncrook—robbing poor spacemen! You—\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   \"You dirty crook!\" Joe roared. \"Robbing honest spacemen!\"\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Harvey nudged him warningly. \"Easy, my boy, easy.\" He turned to the\nbartender apologetically. \"Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands are\nsometimes overactive. You were going to say—?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The round face of the barkeeper had assumed an aggrieved expression.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Folks are always thinkin' the other feller's out to do 'em,\" he said,\nshaking his head. \"Lemme explain about the water here. It's bitter\nas some kinds of sin before it's purified. Have to bring it in with\nbuckets and make it sweet. That takes time and labor. Waddya think—I\nwas chargin' feller critters for water just out of devilment? I charge\nbecause I gotta.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Friend,\" said Harvey, taking out a wallet and counting off eight\nfive-bucko bills, \"here is your money. What's fair is fair, and you\nhave put a different complexion on what seemed at first to be an\nunconscionable interjection of a middleman between Nature and man's\nthirst.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If that's an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor'll discuss filling\nyour tanks. That's me. I'm also justice of the peace, official\nrecorder, fire chief....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And chief of police, no doubt,\" said Harvey jocosely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nope. That's my son, Jed. Angus Johnson's my name. Folks here just\ncall me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will\nyou need?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe estimated quickly. \"About seventy-five liters, if we go on half\nrations,\" he answered. He waited apprehensively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's say ten buckos a liter,\" the mayor said. \"On account of the\nquantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me\nmore to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,\nthat's all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with\nthem. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently\nwatched the crude level-gauge, crying \"Stop!\" when it registered the\nproper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and\nwetted his lips expectantly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: \"But what are we to\ndo about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be\npreposterous. We simply can't afford it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson's response almost floored them. \"Who said anything about\ncharging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.\nIt's just the purified stuff that comes so high.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water\npool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed\nback to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?\" said Harvey as he and Joe\npicked up buckets that hung on the tank. \"Johnson, as I saw instantly,\nis the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just the same,\" Joe griped, \"paying for water isn't something you can\nget used to in ten minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from\nthe igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,\naccording to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their\nbuckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on\na bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign\nin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping\na faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to\ninvestigate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound\nthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had\nto transport water in pails.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It leads\n  <i>\n   to\n  </i>\n  the saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the\npipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it\nleads\n  <i>\n   from\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of\nscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst\ninto the open—before a clear, sparkling pool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and\ntasting it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sweet!\" he snarled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.\nHis mouth went wry. \"Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The\nonly thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor's\nconscience.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,\" said\nHarvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. \"Joseph, the good-natured artist in\nme has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we\nhave had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from this\npoint hence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door they\nstopped and their fists unclenched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thought you gents were leaving,\" the mayor called out, seeing them\nfrozen in the doorway. \"Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.\nHim and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair\nand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been\nborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have\nkept him down near the general dimensions of a man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own\nhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when\nhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed\none.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense\natmosphere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and\nunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were\ngently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features\ndrooping like a bloodhound's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming\ndown with asteroid fever!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\nof the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean,\n  <i>\n   once\n  </i>\n  ?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\nevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\nout of here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then he'll be here for months!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\nhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\nin tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\nfrantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\ncups—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\nrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\nrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\nfew minutes, carrying a bottle.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Joe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowly\ncrossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly,\nput the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.\nWhen Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partner\ndrink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back and\nwaited for the inevitable result.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for several\nmoments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomed\nto perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his features\nstraightened out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are—are you all right?\" asked the mayor anxiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Much better,\" said Joe in a weak voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe you need another dose,\" Harvey suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe recoiled. \"I'm fine now!\" he cried, and sprang off the bar to prove\nit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face,\nand then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" Johnson ejaculated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   La-anago Yergis\n  </i>\n  never fails, my friend,\" Harvey explained. \"By\nactual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three\nminutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught\nthis one before it grew formidable.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. \"If you\ndon't charge too much,\" he said warily, \"I might think of buying some.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,\" Harvey replied with dignity.\n\"It sells itself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole\ncase,\" said Johnson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with\nthe vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How much?\" asked the mayor unhappily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred\nbuckos.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of\ndoing so. \"F-four hundred,\" he offered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,\" Harvey said flatly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Make it four fifty,\" quavered Johnson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I dislike haggling,\" said Harvey.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos and\nfifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: \"And we will include,\n  <i>\n   gratis\n  </i>\n  , an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian\nhandicraftsmanship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. \"No tricks now. I want a taste of\nthat stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The\nmayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuing\nminute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle which\nthe man gradually won.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There ain't no words for that taste,\" he gulped when it was safe to\ntalk again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Medicine,\" Harvey propounded, \"should taste like medicine.\" To Joe he\nsaid: \"Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to\nwhich we have dedicated ourselves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the\nclearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped\nhis murderous silence and cried:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that\nsnake oil?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That was not poison,\" Harvey contradicted quietly. \"It was\n  <i>\n   La-anago\nYergis\n  </i>\n  extract, plus.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Plus what—arsenic?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture\nour specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling\nyonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case,\nmind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had been\nswindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit have\nbeen, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why use it on me?\" Joe demanded furiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. \"Did Johnson ask to\ntaste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce\nthe same\n  <i>\n   medicine\n  </i>\n  that we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a\nguinea pig for a splendid cause.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, okay,\" Joe said. \"But you shoulda charged him more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which\nthat swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he\npossesses. We could not be content with less.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, we're starting all right,\" admitted Joe. \"How about that thing\nwith six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.\nApparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.\nAt first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with our\nstreamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolic\nsuckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on the\naudio-visiphone. Then our triumph—we shall sell him at a stupendous\nfigure to the zoo!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Joe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried\nthe case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared a\nplace of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it\ndown carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gave\nhim, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been at\nleast as good as the first; he gagged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the stuff, all right,\" he said, swallowing hard. He counted\nout the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously\nbalanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain\nat paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,\nand asked: \"You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking about\nfood at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's only water we were short of,\" Harvey said apprehensively. \"We've\ngot rations back at the ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   H-mph!\n  </i>\n  \" the mayor grunted. \"Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.\nSuit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcome\nto our hospitality.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your hospitality,\" said Harvey, \"depends on the prices you charge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying,\" answered\nthe mayor promptly. \"What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here you\ncan't get anywhere else for any price.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He saw\nnone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe,\" he said guardedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson immediately fell into the role of \"mine host.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come right in, gents,\" he invited. \"Right into the dining room.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more or\nless private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was little\nchance of company.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen with\ntwo menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,\nsilverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,\nwhich were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were\nphenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he\ngrinned, bowed and asked: \"Everything satisfactory, gents?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Quite,\" said Harvey. \"We shall order.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the\nculinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service\nwas as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played\ndeftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian\n  <i>\n   viotars\n  </i>\n  , using his other two\nhands for waiting on the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,\" Harvey\nwhispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the\nkitchen, attending to the next course. \"He would make any society\nhostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum\nto women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Think of a fast one fast,\" Joe agreed. \"You're right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,\"\ncomplained Harvey. \"I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honest\nmerchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate\nour check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's been a great honor, gents,\" he said. \"Ain't often I have\nvisitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and\nHarvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in\na yelp of horror.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What the devil is this?\" he shouted.—\"How do you arrive at this\nfantastic, idiotic figure—\n  <i>\n   three hundred and twenty-eight buckos\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Johnson didn't answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,\nnot a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty\nfingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with\nrage. The minute note read: \"Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80\nredsents.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can go to hell!\" Joe growled. \"We won't pay it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson sighed ponderously. \"I was afraid you'd act like that,\" he said\nwith regret. He pulled a tin badge out of his rear pocket, pinned it on\nhis vest, and twisted his holstered gun into view. \"Afraid I'll have to\nask the sheriff to take over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson, the \"sheriff,\" collected the money, and Johnson, the\n\"restaurateur,\" pocketed it. Meanwhile, Harvey tipped Joe the sign to\nremain calm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My friend,\" he said to the mayor, and his tones took on a\nschoolmasterish severity, \"your long absence from Earth has perhaps\nmade you forget those elements of human wisdom that have entered the\nfolk-lore of your native planet. Such as, for example: 'It is folly\nto kill a goose that lays golden eggs,' and 'Penny wise is pound\nfoolish.'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't get the connection,\" objected Johnson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, by obliging us to pay such a high price for your dinner, you put\nout of your reach the chance of profiting from a really substantial\ndeal. My partner and I were prepared to make you a sizable offer for\nthe peculiar creature you call Genius. But by reducing our funds the\nway you have—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who said I wanted to sell him?\" the mayor interrupted. He rubbed his\nfingers together and asked disinterestedly: \"What were you going to\noffer, anyhow?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It doesn't matter any longer,\" Harvey said with elaborate\ncarelessness. \"Perhaps you wouldn't have accepted it, anyway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" Johnson came back emphatically. \"But what would your\noffer have been which I would have turned down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which one? The one we were going to make, or the one we can make now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Either one. It don't make no difference. Genius is too valuable to\nsell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, come now, Mr. Johnson. Don't tell me no amount of money would\ntempt you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nope. But how much did you say?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah, then you will consider releasing Genius!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I'll tell you something,\" said the mayor confidentially. \"When\nyou've got one thing, you've got one thing. But when you've got money,\nit's the same as having a lot of things. Because, if you've got money,\nyou can buy this and that and this and that and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This and that,\" concluded Joe. \"We'll give you five hundred buckos.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, gents!\" Johnson remonstrated. \"Why, six hundred would hardly—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You haven't left us much money,\" Harvey put in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor frowned. \"All right, we'll split the difference. Make it\nfive-fifty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey was quick to pay out, for this was a genuine windfall. Then he\nstood up and admired the astonishing possession he had so inexpensively\nacquired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I really hate to deprive you of this unique creature,\" he said to\nJohnson. \"I should imagine you will be rather lonely, with only your\nfilial mammoth to keep you company.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I sure will,\" Johnson confessed glumly. \"I got pretty attached to\nGenius, and I'm going to miss him something awful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey forcibly removed his eyes from the native, who was clearing off\nthe table almost all at once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My friend,\" he said, \"we take your only solace, it is true, but in his\nplace we can offer something no less amazing and instructive.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor's hand went protectively to his pocket. \"What is it?\" he\nasked with the suspicion of a man who has seen human nature at its\nworst and expects nothing better.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joseph, get our most prized belonging from the communications room of\nthe ship,\" Harvey instructed. To Johnson he explained: \"You must see\nthe wondrous instrument before its value can be appreciated. My partner\nwill soon have it here for your astonishment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe's face grew as glum as Johnson's had been. \"Aw, Harv,\" he\nprotested, \"do we have to sell it? And right when I thought we were\ngetting the key!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We must not be selfish, my boy,\" Harvey said nobly. \"We have had our\nchance; now we must relinquish Fate to the hands of a man who might\nhave more success than we. Go, Joseph. Bring it here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  On a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity\nwould probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with\nquestions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For\nhis part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba\nuntil Joe came in, lugging a radio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is that what you were talking about?\" the mayor snorted. \"What makes\nyou think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and\npolitical speech-makers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do not jump to hasty conclusions,\" Harvey cautioned. \"Another word,\nand I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,\nwith the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor\nof this absolutely awe-inspiring device.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ain't in the market for a radio,\" Johnson said stubbornly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey nodded in relief. \"We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.\nHe has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our\nstudy, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an\nenormous fortune.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, that's no plating off our bow,\" Joe grunted. \"I'm glad he did\nturn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole\nyears.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, hold on!\" the mayor cried. \"I ain't\n  <i>\n   saying\n  </i>\n  I'll buy, but what\nis it I'm turning down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face\nsorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"Joseph and I were among\nthe chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before\nhis tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.\" He\nbanged his fist on the bar. \"I have said it before, and I repeat again,\nthat was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit\nhis greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This what?\" Johnson blurted out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In simple terms,\" clarified Harvey, \"the ingenious doctor discovered\nthat the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by\nenergy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the\ninhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than\nourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would\nfind himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor\nDean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared\nthoughtfully at the battered cabinet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,\" he\nconceded. \"But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks up\nthere wouldn't talk our language.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again Harvey smashed his fist down. \"Do you dare to repeat the scurvy\nlie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson recoiled. \"No—no,\n  <i>\n   of course not\n  </i>\n  . I mean, being up here, I\nnaturally couldn't get all the details.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Naturally,\" Harvey agreed, mollified. \"I'm sorry I lost my temper.\nBut it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts\nemanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be\nso difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was\ncommunication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired\nour language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own\nhyper-scientific trimmings?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, I don't know,\" Johnson said in confusion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect\nthe simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed\nbroadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor\nfailed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could\nstand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to\nsolve the mystery caused him to take his own life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson winced. \"Is that what you want to unload on me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be\nrewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who\ncould devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a\nperson with unusual patience.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain't exactly flighty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Harvey turned a knob on the face of the scarred radio. After several\nsqueals of spatial figures, a smooth voice began:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are omnious pleajes of moby-hailegs in sonmirand which,\nhowgraismon, are notch to be donfured miss ellasellabell in either or\nboth hagasanipaj, by all means. This does not refly, on the brother\nman, nat or mizzafil saces are denuded by this ossifaligo....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey switched off the set determinedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait a minute!\" Johnson begged. \"I almost got it then!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I dislike being commercial,\" said Harvey, \"but this astounding device\nstill belongs to us. Would we not be foolish to let you discover the\nclue before purchasing the right to do so?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor nodded indecisively, looking at the radio with agonized\nlonging. \"How much do you want?\" he asked unhappily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One thousand buckos, and no haggling. I am not in the mood.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson opened his mouth to argue; then, seeing Harvey's set features,\npaid with the worst possible grace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you think we ought to tell him about the batteries, Harv?\" Joe\nasked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about the batteries?\" demanded Johnson with deadly calm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A very small matter,\" Harvey said airily. \"You see, we have been\nanalyzing these broadcasts for three years. In that time, of course,\nthe batteries are bound to weaken. I estimate these should last not\nless than one Terrestrial month, at the very least.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do I do then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harvey shrugged. \"Special batteries are required, which I see Joseph\nhas by chance brought along. For the batteries, the only ones of their\nkind left in the system, I ask only what they cost—one hundred and\nninety-nine buckos, no more and, on the other hand, no less.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Johnson was breathing hard, and his hand hovered dangerously near his\ngun. But he paid the amount Harvey wanted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Moreover, he actually shook hands when the two panacea purveyors\ncollected their six-armed prize and said goodbye. Before they were\noutside, however, he had turned on the radio and was listening tensely\nto a woman's highly cultured, though rather angry voice, saying:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, you hannaforge are all beasa-taga-sanimort.

LAFFERTY\n </h2>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there be\nlife traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. So\nthey skipped several steps in the procedure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The chordata discerner read\n  <i>\n   Positive\n  </i>\n  over most of the surface. There\nwas spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omitted\nseveral tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thought\non the body?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; it\nrequired a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they found\nnothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Then\nit came—clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Limited,\" said Steiner, \"as though within a pale. As though there were\nbut one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of the\nsurface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hours\nbefore it's back in our ken if we let it go now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest of\nthe world to make sure we've missed nothing,\" said Stark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult of\nanalysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This was\ndesigned simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this might\nbe so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and the\ndesigner of it were puzzled as to how to read the results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locator\nhad refused to read\n  <i>\n   Positive\n  </i>\n  when turned on the inventor himself,\nbad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he had\nextraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. He\ntold the machine so heatedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, that\nGlaser did\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinary\nperception to an extraordinary degree. There is a\n  <i>\n   difference\n  </i>\n  , the\nmachine insisted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but built\nothers more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the owners\nof Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (or\nEppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read\n  <i>\n   Positive\n  </i>\n  on a\nnumber of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could not\neven read music. But it had also read\n  <i>\n   Positive\n  </i>\n  on ninety per cent of\nthe acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been a\nsound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Mi\nit had read\n  <i>\n   Positive\n  </i>\n  on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out of\nbillions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at all\nwas shown by the test.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the area\nand got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently one\nindividual, though this could not be certain) and got very definite\naction. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, and\nassumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it ever\nproduces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrug\nof the shoulders in a man. They called it the \"You tell\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  light.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So among the intelligences there was at least one that might be\nextraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to be\nforewarned.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Scan the remainder of the world, Steiner,\" said Stark, \"and the rest\nof us will get some sleep. If you find no other spot then we will go\ndown on that one the next time it is in position under us, in about\ntwelve hours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't want to visit any of the other areas first? Somewhere away\nfrom the thoughtful creature?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. The rest of the world may be dangerous. There must be a reason\nthat thought is in one spot only. If we find no others then we will go\ndown boldly and visit this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So they all, except Steiner, went off to their bunks then: Stark, the\nCaptain; Gregory Gilbert, the executive officer; Wolfgang Langweilig,\nthe engineer; Casper Craig, super-cargo, tycoon and 51% owner of the\nLittle Probe, and F. R. Briton, S.J., a Jesuit priest who was linguist\nand checker champion of the craft.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dawn did not come to the moon-town. The Little Probe hovered stationary\nin the light and the moon-town came up under the dawn. Then the Probe\nwent down to visit whatever was there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's no town,\" said Steiner. \"Not a building. Yet we're on the\ntrack of the minds. There's nothing but a meadow and some boscage, a\nsort of fountain or pool, and four streams coming out of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep on towards the minds,\" said Stark. \"They're our target.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a building, not two sticks or stones placed together. That looks\nlike an Earth-type sheep there. And that looks like an Earth-lion,\nI'm almost afraid to say. And those two ... why, they could well be\nEarth-people. But with a difference. Where is that bright light coming\nfrom?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know, but they're right in the middle of it. Land here. We'll\ngo to meet them at once. Timidity has never been an efficacious tool\nwith us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, they were people. And one could only wish that all people were\nlike them. There was a man and a woman, and they were clothed either\nin very bright garments or in no garments at all, but only in a very\nbright light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Talk to them, Father Briton,\" said Stark. \"You are the linguist.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Howdy,\" said the priest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He may or may not have been understood, but the two of them smiled at\nhim, so he went on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Father Briton from Philadelphia,\" he said, \"on detached service. And\nyou, my good man, what is your handle, your monicker, your tag?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ha-Adamah,\" said the man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And your daughter, or niece?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It may be that the shining man frowned momentarily at this; but the\nwoman smiled, proving that she was human.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The woman is named Hawwah,\" said the man. \"The sheep is named sheep,\nthe lion is named lion, the horse is named horse and the hoolock is\nnamed hoolock.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand. It is possible that this could go on and on. How is it\nthat you use the English tongue?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have only one tongue; but it is given to us to be understood by all;\nby the eagle, by the squirrel, by the ass, by the English.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We happen to be bloody Yankees, but we use a borrowed tongue. You\nwouldn't have a drink on you for a tubful of thirsty travellers, would\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The fountain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah—I see.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  But the crew all drank of the fountain to be sociable. It was water,\nbut water that excelled, cool and with all its original bubbles like\nthe first water ever made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you make of them?\" asked Stark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Human,\" said Steiner. \"It may even be that they are a little more than\nhuman. I don't understand that light that surrounds them. And they seem\nto be clothed, as it were, in dignity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And very little else,\" said Father Briton, \"though that light trick\ndoes serve a purpose. But I'm not sure they'd pass in Philadelphia.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Talk to them again,\" said Stark. \"You're the linguist.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That isn't necessary here, Captain. Talk to them yourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are there any other people here?\" Stark asked the man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The two of us. Man and woman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But are there any others?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How would there be any others? What other kind of people could there\nbe than man and woman?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But is there more than one man or woman?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How could there be more than one of anything?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain was a little puzzled by this, but he went on doggedly:\n\"Ha-Adamah, what do you think that we are? Are we not people?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are not anything till I name you. But I will name you and then\nyou can be. You are named Captain. He is named Priest. He is named\nEngineer. He is named Flunky.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks a lot,\" said Steiner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But are we not people?\" persisted Captain Stark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. We are the people. There are no people but two. How could there be\nother people?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the damnest thing about it,\" muttered Langweilig, \"is, how are you\ngoing to prove him wrong? But it does give you a small feeling.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can we have something to eat?\" asked the Captain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pick from the trees,\" said Ha-Adamah, \"and then it may be that you\nwill want to sleep on the grass. Being not of human nature (which does\nnot need sleep or rest), it may be that you require respite. But you\nare free to enjoy the garden and its fruits.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will,\" said Captain Stark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They wandered about the place, but they were uneasy. There were the\nanimals. The lion and lioness were enough to make one cautious, though\nthey offered no harm. The two bears had a puzzling look, as though they\nwanted either to frolic with you or to mangle you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If there are only two people here,\" said Casper Craig, \"then it may be\nthat the rest of the world is not dangerous at all. It looked fertile\nwherever we scanned it, though not so fertile as this central bit. And\nthose rocks would bear examining.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Flecked with gold, and possibly with something else,\" said Stark. \"A\nvery promising site.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And everything grows here,\" added Steiner. \"Those are Earth-fruits and\nI never saw finer. I've tasted the grapes and plums and pears. The figs\nand dates are superb, the quince is as flavorsome as a quince can be,\nthe cherries are excellent. And I never did taste such oranges. But I\nhaven't yet tried the—\" and he stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you're thinking what I'm afraid to think,\" said Gilbert, \"then it\nwill be the test at least: whether we're having a pleasant dream or\nwhether this is reality. Go ahead and eat one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I won't be the first to eat one. You eat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ask him first. You ask him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ha-Adamah, is it allowed to eat the apples?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly. Eat. It is the finest fruit in the garden.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Well, the analogy breaks down there,\" said Stark. \"I was almost\nbeginning to believe in the thing. But if it isn't that, then what.\nFather Briton, you are the linguist, but in Hebrew does not Ha-Adamah\nand Hawwah mean—?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course they do. You know that as well as I.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was never a believer. But would it be possible for the exact same\nproposition to maintain here as on Earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All things are possible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And it was then that Ha-Adamah, the shining man, gave a wild cry: \"No,\nno. Do not approach it. It is not allowed to eat of that one!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the pomegranate tree, and he was warning Langweilig away from it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Once more, Father,\" said Stark, \"you should be the authority; but does\nnot the idea that it was the apple that was forbidden go back only to a\nmedieval painting?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It does. The name of the fruit is not mentioned in Genesis. In Hebrew\nexegesis, however, the pomegranate is usually indicated.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought so. Question the man further, Father. This is too\nincredible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is a little odd. Adam, old man, how long have you been here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forever less six days is the answer that has been given to me. I never\ndid understand the answer, however.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And have you gotten no older in all that time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I do not understand what 'older' is. I am as I have been from the\nbeginning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And do you think that you will ever die?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To die I do not understand. I am taught that it is a property of\nfallen nature to die, and that does not pertain to me or mine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And are you completely happy here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perfectly happy according to my preternatural state. But I am taught\nthat it might be possible to lose that happiness, and then to seek it\nvainly through all the ages. I am taught that sickness and ageing and\neven death could come if this happiness were ever lost. I am taught\nthat on at least one other unfortunate world it has actually been lost.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you consider yourself a knowledgeable man?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, since I am the only man, and knowledge is natural to man. But I\nam further blessed. I have a preternatural intellect.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Stark cut in once more: \"There must be some one question you could\nask him, Father. Some way to settle it. I am becoming nearly convinced.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, there is a question that will settle it. Adam, old man, how about\na game of checkers?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is hardly the time for clowning,\" said Stark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not clowning, Captain. How about it, Adam? I'll give you choice of\ncolors and first move.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. It would be no contest. I have a preternatural intellect.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I beat a barber who was champion of Germantown. And I beat the\nchampion of Morgan County, Tennessee, which is the hottest checker\ncenter on Earth. I've played against, and beaten, machines. But I\nnever played a preternatural mind. Let's just set up the board, Adam,\nand have a go at it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. It would be no contest. I would not like to humble you.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They were there for three days. They were delighted with the place.\nIt was a world with everything, and it seemed to have only two\ninhabitants. They went everywhere except into the big cave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is there, Adam?\" asked Captain Stark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The great serpent lives there. I would not disturb him. He has long\nbeen cranky because plans he had for us did not materialize. But we\nare taught that should ever evil come to us, which it cannot if we\npersevere, it will come by him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They learned no more of the real nature of the sphere in their time\nthere. Yet all but one of them were convinced of the reality when they\nleft. And they talked of it as they took off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A crowd would laugh if told of it,\" said Stark, \"but not many would\nlaugh if they had actually seen the place, or them. I am not a gullible\nman, but I am convinced of this: that this is a pristine and pure world\nand that ours and all the others we have visited are fallen worlds.\nHere are the prototypes of our first parents before their fall. They\nare garbed in light and innocence, and they have the happiness that\nwe have been seeking for centuries. It would be a crime if anyone\ndisturbed that happiness.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I too am convinced,\" said Steiner. \"It is Paradise itself, where the\nlion lies down with the lamb, and where the serpent has not prevailed.\nIt would be the darkest of crimes if we or others should play the part\nof the serpent, and intrude and spoil.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am probably the most skeptical man in the world,\" said Casper Craig\nthe tycoon, \"but I do believe my eyes. I have been there and seen it.\nIt is indeed an unspoiled Paradise; and it would be a crime calling to\nthe wide heavens for vengeance for anyone to smirch in any way that\nperfection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So much for that.

We'll\nhave time to overhaul the blasters. We haven't had any well-equipped\nsettlers for six weeks. It used to be we'd hardly have time to strip\nand slaughter and stow before there was another batch to take care of.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think you'd better write me some new lines,\" said Adam. \"I feel like\na goof saying those same ones to each bunch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are a goof, and therefore perfect for the part. I was in show\nbusiness long enough to know never to change a line too soon. I did\nchange Adam and Eve to Ha-Adamah and Hawwah, and the apple to the\npomegranate. People aren't becoming any smarter—but they are becoming\nbetter researched, and they insist on authenticity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is still a perfect come-on here. There is something in human\nnature that cannot resist the idea of a Perfect Paradise. Folks will\nwhoop and holler to their neighbors to come in droves to spoil and mar\nit. It isn't greed or the desire for new land so much—though that is\nstrong too. Mainly it is the feverish passion to befoul and poison what\nis unspoiled. Fortunately I am sagacious enough to take advantage of\nthis trait. And when you start to farm a new world on a shoestring you\nhave to acquire your equipment as you can.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked proudly around at the great cave with its mountains and tiers\nof materials, heavy machinery of all sorts, titanic crates of foodstuff\nspace-sealed; wheeled, tracked, propped, vaned and jetted vehicles; and\npower packs to run a world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at the three dozen space ships stripped and stacked, and at\nthe rather large pile of bone-meal in one corner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will have to have another lion,\" said Eve. \"Bowser is getting old,\nand Marie-Yvette abuses him and gnaws his toes. And we do have to have\na big-maned lion to lie down with the lamb.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know it, Eve. The lion is a very important prop. Maybe one of the\ncrackpot settlers will bring a new lion.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And can't you mix another kind of shining paint? This itches.

The crew is made up of Stark, Gilbert, Steiner, Langweilig, Craig, and Briton—the captain, executive officer, crewmember, engineer, part-owner of the probe, and a Catholic priest respectively.\nFrom orbit, the crew scans the moon using various technological instruments. They discover abundant highly developed life forms including a small location of sentient life, possibly of extraordinary magnitude. \n\nThey descend to the moon’s surface near the location of the sentient life. They discover a multitude of plants and animals that are found on Earth, also finding two individuals that appear to be human, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah.\n\nTheir investigation of the surroundings bears a startling resemblance to the biblical story of Genesis. The crew is bewildered to consider that this may indeed be a new Garden of Eden which never fell into sin and was preserved as a perfect paradise.\n\nAfter remaining for a few days, the crew returns to their probe. They remark how immoral it would be to meddle such an unspoiled paradise, but nevertheless begin the process of advertising the world to potential colonizers who would indeed exploit the moon for profit.\n\nSurprisingly, it is revealed that back on the planet that the individuals that were merely posing as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah working with their boss, Snake-oil Sam, to deceive potential colonists, ambushing them upon arrival and confiscating their valuable supplies and equipment.\n\nBack on the probe Father Briton chides the rest of the crew that they had been taken in by an obvious ruse and to inform any potential colonists to prepare for armed resistance. The incredulous crew demands to know the reasoning behind his conclusion.  He casually says that besides what he contended were glaring inaccuracies, the fact that Ha-Adamah refused to play him in checkers despite claiming to have a preternaturally perfect intellect was all the proof he needed."}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "04863686a732485b9d5ac52f857d1dd8", "response_text": "Steiner uses several tools to determine if there is any life on a little moon that his craft hovers over.

The man explains that he is able to speak whatever language his listener needs to hear in order to understand, and this includes animals like eagles and squirrels. \n\nStark then asks the mostly naked man if there are other humans on the moon. Adam says there cannot be more than one of anything. He then names each member of the crew something different and explains that they cannot be people because the man and woman themselves are people.\n\nThe crew members consume fruit from the garden and are incredibly surprised at their quality. The produce tastes better than anything they have ever eaten on earth. They begin to make the connections between this place and the Garden of Eden, and they wonder if they are dreaming. The man tells Langweilig he is not allowed to eat from the pomegranate tree, and the priest explains that in other languages, it is not the apple that is forbidden in the Garden of Eden, but the pomegranate. \n\nThe crew members continue to silently make comparisons to the Biblical story. Adam tells the men that he has heard about another world in which the people have fallen. He also explains that he has a preternatural intellect. In order to check his claims, the priest asks Adam to play checkers, but he refuses.\n\nThe crew members learn about the large serpent that lives in a nearby cave. Adam claims that if evil is to come to him, it will happen via the serpent. \n\nAfter leaving on their ship, all of the crew members are convinced that they have found an actual paradise, a place that has yet to be touched and has not yet fallen. They are eager to take advantage of the land’s resources and exploit the perfect conditions by selling off the land to settlers. \n\nThe only person who disagrees that this Garden of Eden is real is the priest. He points out several inconsistencies and argues that Adam refused to play checkers because in reality he could not win. His skepticism convinces his colleagues that their shared experience was in fact fake. \n\nMeanwhile, Adam and Eve take off their costumes and the paint on their bodies that causes them to glow. Snake-Oil Sam comes out of his cave and the trio begins to prepare for the return of the settlers. They have done this many times before, and each time they fool a group of people, those settlers come back and Snake-Oil Sam takes everything they have and stockpiles it for himself.

Briton, the priest, is also a linguist so he approaches the two people that they find, and is surprised when he is easily understood. The man, Ha Adamah, speaks English perfectly, and says it is due to a special character of his own language that anyone can understand him. The woman on the surface, Hawwah, does not speak while the crew is there. These two are the only humanoids that the crew notices, and they find that the bright light seems to be coming from the people themselves. The main features on the surface are a large garden and a fountain, and the crew is struck by the resemblance to the biblical story of Adam and Eve. They test the boundaries of the similarities by asking to eat apples, which they are told is fine, but then find that pomegranates are not allowed to be consumed. This does not discount the similarity, as some versions of the story say that pomegranates were the forbidden fruit, and the crew is even more baffled when they hear that there is a serpent there that is the source of evil: they do not meet him, as he is in a cave. After three days on the surface, with Father Briton asking questions all the while, the crew goes back to the Little Prob where they discuss what they had witnessed. Stark was astounded at the purity of the world, and thought it needed to be protected, as did Steiner. Craig, the tycoon who owns 51% of the probe, admitted it was beautiful and would be terrible to ruin, but immediately works on dictating a message to Gilbert, the executive officer, advertising the moon to those who might want to buy or lease land there. On the surface, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah are meeting with the Old Serpent—it turns out that the entire situation was a ploy to draw the humans in, and they regularly kill incoming settlers to take their supplies. Father Briton is the only one who is suspicious, and convinces the rest of the crew that they have to doubt what they had just experienced—besides flaws in logic, he was surprised that his offer of a checkers game had been denied, as it would have been a chance for Ha-Adamah to show off."}, {"worker_id": "6", "uid": "f77fecfc1cc6490f8aa8f2beade9b307", "response_text": "\tA crew of six find themselves in outer space, searching for their next mission.

He introduces himself and the woman, named Hawwah. Father Briton asks him a few questions about their surroundings and names, and the Man responds with convoluted answers. He points the crew towards the fountain, so they may quench their thirst. Although hesitant at first, the men soon realize this water is the best they’ve ever had: the freshest, bubbliest, and clearest. Their suspicions about this place and the Man and Woman only grow. \n\tThe Captain attempts to question Ha-Adamah, and his answers confirm their suspicions. This place might be Paradise or Eden, the place where humanity was born and disgraced. Ha-Adamah welcomes them and offers the fruit on the trees to eat, except for the pomegranates. Ha-Adamah reveals that he is happy here, but that he has been warned that he may lose this happiness and lead the rest of his life desperately trying to find it again. The Man also shies away from the cave where he says the great and evil serpent lives. The crew, now convinced, leave this land and call it in. Selling it as paradise perfect for ranching, farming, camping, or other industrial uses, they plot their return with settlers to take over the land. Only Father Briton believes paradise is not paradise at all, simply a trick. \n\tThe story flashes back to the surface, where Hawwah and Ha-Adamah are huddling with the Serpent, Snake-Oil Sam. It is revealed that they pretend to be Adam and Eve to draw in settlers, only to steal their equipment and kill them. The Serpent congratulates them on their work, but reminds them that more is to be done in order to farm this new world and get all the equipment they need. \n\tOn the spaceship, Father Briton asks for an armed escort to accompany them.

He\nhad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\nwere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\nhad flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand\npardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no\nname. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by\neight.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\nabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\nRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\nnumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\nvaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\nnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\nthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\nreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\nwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\nwithout justifying it.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\ndown at Baron’s table. He was short and wiry. His face held\nno key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but\nhe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\nforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\nhealing.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re\nplanning to attempt the Brightside.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Baron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read\ntelecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going\nto make a Brightside Crossing.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “At perihelion?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Of course. When else?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The grizzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment\nwithout expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re\nnot going to make the Crossing.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “The name is Claney,” said the stranger.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  There was a silence.

I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the\nwhole idea.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My\nfriend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking.\nHere, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His\nfingers were trembling.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Peter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you\nwant to hear.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “But you’ve\n  <i>\n   got\n  </i>\n  to. You’re the only man on Earth who’s\nattempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the\nstory you cleared for the news—it was nothing. We need\n  <i>\n   details\n  </i>\n  . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you\nmiscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a\nfinger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma?\nWhy? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve\ngot to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make\nit across where your attempt failed—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Of course we want to know. We\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  to know.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t\ndo it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross\nthe Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Claney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You\ncan blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in\nboth quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting.\nIt was the\n  <i>\n   planet\n  </i>\n  that whipped us, that and the\n  <i>\n   Sun\n  </i>\n  .

I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\nI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\nproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\nconditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made\na hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a\nterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  But it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “No particular plans,” I told him. “Why?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  He looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “No, I mean\n  <i>\n   real\n  </i>\n  heat.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be\ndangerous, too.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “What trip?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion?\nWhat have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then,\n  <i>\n   nobody’s\n  </i>\n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n  <i>\n   how\n  </i>\n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I wanted to be along.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Twilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He’d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that\nmuch change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but\nhe’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around—our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve\nprobably heard of him.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil,\nisn’t he?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We’ll need plenty of both.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “No. Are you worried?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list.\n“Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n  <i>\n   could\n  </i>\n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago—but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling\nthe waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Of course.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around\nthem. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place\nlike this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most\nreliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t\nour big problem right then.\n  <i>\n   Equipment\n  </i>\n  worried us first and\n  <i>\n   route\n  </i>\n  next.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you\nhave?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each\none had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid\nthe clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit\nand oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every\neight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting\nsurface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And\nwe had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between\nthe two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at\n770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders\nif the suits failed somewhere.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “How about the Bugs?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on\nthem too much for protection.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility\nand storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of\nforward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant\nthat we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air\nbetween us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like\nwater and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of\nsulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Baron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass\nas he set it down on the tablecloth.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right.\nWe just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m\ngetting to that.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  He settled back in his chair and continued.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\nwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\ncould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\nCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest\napproach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of\nthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\nwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\nthat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\nsurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\nwas only half done—we would still have to travel another\ntwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\nwas to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship,\napproximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\nseventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\nwhat terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\ntime-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\nthat.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n“Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\ndown for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\nyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of\ndragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty\nclosely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\nIf there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead\non foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack\nand I were planning to change around. We figured he could\ntake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that,\nJack?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It\ndoesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does\nit make any difference?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank\nPeter along with me. Right?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going\nto do the advance scouting?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead\nBug light as possible.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down\nto the frame and wheels.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the\n  <i>\n   advance\n  </i>\n  work.\nYou need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to\npick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?”\nHe stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of\na hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\nahead?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said\nsharply.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Charts! I’m talking about\n  <i>\n   detail\n  </i>\n  work. We don’t need to\nworry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you\ncan’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts\ndown excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\nreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\nI can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\narea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\nThen—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “No dice,” the Major broke in.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “But why not? We could save ourselves days!”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When\nwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\nmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\nclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\nalone—any time, any place.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\ngave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff.\nWe’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\nGot that?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\nwe nodded, too.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  “All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight,\nlet’s go.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll\nnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\nbreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\nfirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\nfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\nthe Twilight Lab.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\nMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\ntaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\nStone dragged the sledges.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\nthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\nash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\nthe first twenty miles.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\nthe track the early research teams had made out into the edge\nof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s\nlittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\nwere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\nbite.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  We didn’t\n  <i>\n   feel\n  </i>\n  the heat so much those first days out. We\n  <i>\n   saw\n  </i>\n  it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\ndegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\nthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\nsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\nsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\ncame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\na light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\nThe sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\ndegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\nforward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates,\nbulk gelatin, vitamins.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\nwe’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\nWe were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\nand psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting\nreasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\nhappened to be so.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\neyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\nbut we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking\nat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\ntaste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers\nfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\nthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\nEarth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\nHuge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\nwith black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\nwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\ngases.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\nthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\nhad ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\ntried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\nso it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\nthe hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\ncould throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\nbefore, except for that Sun. We’d fought absolute cold before\nand won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only\nworse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\nitself.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\nget us. That was the bargain.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\nThe gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\nonto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\neast. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\non Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\ncones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\nsides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  We couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,\nsulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\nface of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\nrose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\nrubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\nfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\ndust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\nash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous\nsurface for the Bug’s pillow tires.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\nsag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\nfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\na halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\nlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\nuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\nwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\nat first.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\nthink so, too.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  McIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\nHe talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\ndriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\nwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\nnow and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\neach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but\nI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\nenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\nthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\nfilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\nconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\nend of an eight-hour trek.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c004\">\n  But it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the\npenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves.

Baron asks for details about their trek and what went wrong, but Claney refuses to give him the details. Claney is an older man now with an epithelioma on his face. Although he came to warn him, he quickly learns that Baron may only listen if he hears the truth. So Claney recounts the story. \nMajor Tom Mikuta recruited Claney, Jack Stone, and Ted McIvers to join him. They were to adventure to the Brightside Crossing at perihelion, a more dangerous journey. Temperatures reached up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit at perihelion, but Mikuta was an all-or-nothing man. Stone arrived on Mercury first, soon followed by Mikuta and Claney. McIvers was the last to arrive and they left soon after with three Bugs and one tractor dragging the sledges. Stone was briefed by Sanderson, the head of the observatory, before they left, and the men pored over all images and maps of the Crossing before beginning. \nDespite their high-tech spacesuits and general gadgets, the giant sun still got to them. They were constantly thirsty and hot, and their skin itched and burned. They drove for eight hours, then slept for five. They needed to travel 70 miles a day.

He retreats into himself, while McIvers chatters nonstop to fill the silence. Tension grew among the crew, especially as McIvers put himself at risk by adventuring away from them. \nClaney lead the gang in his Bug, while McIvers and Mikuta flanked him. Stone was in the very back.

By the time the other two arrive, Jack seems somewhat despondent based on what Sanderson has told him about the difficulties and improbability of the mission.

This seems like something McIvers had pushed for in a previous conversation, but Jack says he doesn’t mind and Mikuta agrees to the switch.

What with red-spot\n  <br/>\n  fever, talking cockatoos and flagpole trees,\n  <br/>\n  I was running in circles—especially since\n  <br/>\n  Grannie became twins every now and then.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  We had left the offices of\n  <i>\n   Interstellar Voice\n  </i>\n  three days ago, Earth\ntime, and now as the immense disc of Jupiter flamed across the sky,\nentered the outer limits of the Baldric. Grannie Annie strode in the\nlead, her absurd long-skirted black dress looking as out of place in\nthis desert as the trees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Flagpole trees. They rose straight up like enormous cat-tails, with\nonly a melon-shaped protuberance at the top to show they were a form of\nvegetation. Everything else was blanketed by the sand and the powerful\nwind that blew from all quarters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As we reached the first of those trees, Grannie came to a halt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is the Baldric all right. If my calculations are right, we've hit\nit at its narrowest spot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ezra Karn took a greasy pipe from his lips and spat. \"It looks like the\nrest of this God-forsaken moon,\" he said, \"'ceptin for them sticks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Xartal, the Martian illustrator, said nothing. He was like that,\ntaciturn, speaking only when spoken to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could be excused this time, however, for this was only our third day\non Jupiter's Eighth Moon, and the country was still strange to us.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n  <i>\n   Lady of the Green Flames\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n  </i>\n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature—authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n  <i>\n   Interstellar Voice\n  </i>\n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n  <i>\n   Interstellar Voice\n  </i>\n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n  <i>\n   Interstellar Voice\n  </i>\n  and\n  <i>\n   Larynx Incorporated\n  </i>\n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  So now here we were at the outer reaches of the Baldric, four travelers\non foot with only the barest necessities in the way of equipment and\nsupplies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I walked forward to get a closer view of one of the flagpole trees. And\nthen abruptly I saw something else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A queer-looking bird squatted there in the sand, looking up at me.\nSilver in plumage, it resembled a parrot with a crest; and yet it\ndidn't. In some strange way the thing was a hideous caricature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look what I found,\" I yelled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What I found,\" said the cockatoo in a very human voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thunder, it talks,\" I said amazed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Talks,\" repeated the bird, blinking its eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cockatoo repeated my last statement again, then rose on its short\nlegs, flapped its wings once and soared off into the sky. Xartal,\nthe Martian illustrator, already had a notebook in his hands and was\nsketching a likeness of the creature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten minutes later we were on the move again. We saw more silver\ncockatoos and more flagpole trees. Above us, the great disc of Jupiter\nbegan to descend toward the horizon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then all at once Grannie stopped again, this time at the top of a\nhigh ridge. She shielded her eyes and stared off into the plain we had\njust crossed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said to me in a strange voice, \"look down there and\ntell me what you see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I followed the direction of her hand and a shock went through me from\nhead to foot. Down there, slowly toiling across the sand, advanced a\nparty of four persons. In the lead was a little old lady in a black\ndress. Behind her strode a grizzled Earth man in a flop-brimmed hat,\nanother Earth man, and a Martian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Detail for detail they were a duplicate of ourselves!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A mirage!\" said Ezra Karn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it wasn't a mirage. As the party came closer, we could see that\ntheir lips were moving, and their voices became audible. I listened in\nawe. The duplicate of myself was talking to the duplicate of Grannie\nAnnie, and she was replying in the most natural way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steadily the four travelers approached. Then, when a dozen yards away,\nthey suddenly faded like a negative exposed to light and disappeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you make of it?\" I said in a hushed voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie shook her head. \"Might be a form of mass hypnosis superinduced\nby some chemical radiations,\" she replied. \"Whatever it is, we'd better\nwatch our step. There's no telling what might lie ahead.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We walked after that with taut nerves and watchful eyes, but we saw no\nrepetition of the \"mirage.\" The wind continued to blow ceaselessly, and\nthe sand seemed to grow more and more powdery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For some time I had fixed my gaze on a dot in the sky which I supposed\nto be a high-flying cockatoo. As that dot continued to move across the\nheavens in a single direction, I called Grannie's attention to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a kite,\" she nodded. \"There should be a car attached to it\nsomewhere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She offered no further explanation, but a quarter of an hour later as\nwe topped another rise a curious elliptical car with a long slanting\nwindscreen came into view. Attached to its hood was a taut wire which\nslanted up into the sky to connect with the kite.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man was driving and when he saw us, he waved. Five minutes later\nGrannie was shaking his hand vigorously and mumbling introductions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is Jimmy Baker,\" she said. \"He manages\n  <i>\n   Larynx Incorporated\n  </i>\n  , and\nhe's the real reason we're here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decided I liked Baker the moment I saw him. In his middle thirties,\nhe was tall and lean, with pleasant blue eyes which even his sand\ngoggles could not conceal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, Grannie,\" he said. \"If\nanybody can help me, you can.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie's eyes glittered. \"Trouble with the mine laborers?\" she\nquestioned.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as we\nheaded back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on an\nelectric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently these\nadjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for the\ncar's ability to move in any direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If I weren't a realist, I'd say that\n  <i>\n   Larynx Incorporated\n  </i>\n  has been\nbewitched,\" he began slowly. \"We pay our men high wages and give them\nexcellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.\nUp until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health and\nspirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Red Spot Fever?\" Grannie looked at him curiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jimmy Baker nodded. \"The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousness\non the part of the patient. Then they disappear.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They walk out into the Baldric,\" he continued, \"and nothing can stop\nthem. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon as\nthey realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyes\nare turned, they give us the slip.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But surely you must have some idea of where they go,\" Grannie said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Baker lit a cigarette. \"There's all kinds of rumors,\" he replied, \"but\nnone of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrie\nahead of us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended between\na rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation of\ntranslucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos were\nperched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, but\nthey didn't move.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of\n  <i>\n   Larynx Incorporated\n  </i>\n  . As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,\na door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face was\ndrawn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Baker,\" he said breathlessly, \"seventy-five workers at Shaft Four\nhave headed out into the Baldric.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shaft Four, eh?\" he repeated. \"That's our principal mine. If the fever\nspreads there, I'm licked.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. Silent\nXartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got his\nnotebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remained\nstanding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself to\nthe bottle of Martian whiskey there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There must be ways of stopping this,\" she said. \"Have you called in\nany physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send the\nmen away until the plague has died down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Baker shook his head. \"Three doctors from Callisto were here last\nmonth. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away,\nI may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company is\nchartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means. Failure\nto produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose all\nrights.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. A\nman's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said \"Okay\" and\nthrew off the switch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric,\" he said\nslowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk.\nGrannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where that\ncorridor is at its widest,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Baker looked up. \"That's right. We only began operations there a\ncomparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix that\nruns deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of\n  <i>\n   Interstellar Voice\n  </i>\n  , our rival, in a year.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie nodded. \"I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run up\nthere,\" she said. \"But first I want to see your laboratory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lower\nlevel where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the length\nof the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and began\ndropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or four\nWellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a small\ndynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wire\nand other items.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and the\nMartian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began to\nroll down the ramp.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Not until they had vanished in the desert haze did I sense the\nloneliness of this outpost. With that loneliness came a sudden sense of\nforeboding. Had I been a fool to let Grannie go? I thought of her, an\nold woman who should be in a rocking chair, knitting socks. If anything\nhappened to Annabella C. Flowers, I would never forgive myself and\nneither would her millions of readers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ezra Karn and I went back into the office. The old prospector chuckled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dang human dynamo. Got more energy than a runaway comet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A connecting door on the far side of the office opened onto a long\ncorridor which ended at a staircase.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's look around,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We passed down the corridor and climbed the staircase to the second\nfloor. Here were the general offices of\n  <i>\n   Larynx Incorporated\n  </i>\n  , and\nthrough glass doors I could see clerks busy with counting machines and\nreport tapes. In another chamber the extremely light Acoustix ore was\nbeing packed into big cases and marked for shipment. At the far end a\ndoor to a small room stood open. Inside a young man was tilted back in\na swivel chair before a complicated instrument panel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"C'mon in,\" he said, seeing us. \"If you want a look at your friends,\nhere they are.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He flicked a stud, and the entire wall above the panel underwent a\nslow change of colors. Those colors whirled kaleidescopically, then\ncoalesced into a three-dimensional scene.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a scene of a rapidly unfolding desert country as seen from the\nrear of a kite car. Directly behind the windscreen, backs turned to me,\nwere Jimmy Baker, Grannie, and Xartal. It was as if I were standing\ndirectly behind them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's Mr. Baker's own invention,\" the operator said. \"An improvement on\nthe visiphone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and its\npassengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure.\" The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voice\nentered the room. It stopped abruptly. \"The machine uses a lot of\npower,\" the operator said, \"and as yet we haven't got much.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappeared\nsomewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myself\nposted of Grannie's movements.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Karn and I went down to the commissary where we ate our supper. When\nwe returned to Jimmy Baker's office, the visiphone bell was ringing.\nI went over to it and turned it on, and to my surprise the face of\nAntlers Park flashed on the screen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello,\" he said in his friendly way. \"I see you arrived all right. Is\nMiss Flowers there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four,\" I said. \"There's\ntrouble up there. Red spot fever.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fever, eh?\" repeated Park. \"That's a shame. Is there anything I can\ndo?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell me,\" I said, \"has your company had any trouble with this plague?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to the\nother side of the Baldric. We had one partial case, but my chemists\ngave the chap an antitoxin that seems to have worked. Come to think of\nit, I might drive over to Shaft Four and give Jimmy Baker the formula.\nI haven't been out in the Baldric for years, but if you didn't have any\ntrouble, I shouldn't either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We exchanged a few more pleasantries, and then he rang off. In exactly\nan hour I went upstairs to the visiscreen room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then once more I was directly behind my friends, listening in on their\nconversation. The view through the windscreen showed an irregular array\nof flagpole trees, with the sky dotted by high-flying cockatoos.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's an eyrie over there,\" Jimmy Baker was saying. \"We might as\nwell camp beside it.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Moments later a rude circle of flagpole trees loomed ahead. Across the\ntop of them was stretched a translucent web. Jimmy and Grannie got out\nof the car and began making camp. Xartal remained in his seat. He was\ndrawing pictures on large pieces of pasteboard, and as I stood there in\nthe visiscreen room, I watched him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no doubt about it, the Martian was clever. He would make\na few rapid lines on one of the pasteboards, rub it a little to get\nthe proper shading and then go on to the next. In swift rotation\nlikenesses of Ezra Karn, of myself, of Jimmy Baker, and of Antlers Park\ntook form.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ezra spoke over my shoulder. \"He's doing scenes for Grannie's new\nbook,\" he said. \"The old lady figures on using the events here for a\nplot.\n  <i>\n   Look at that damned nosy bird!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A silver cockatoo had alighted on the kite car and was surveying\ncuriously Xartal's work. As each drawing was completed, the bird\nscanned it with rapt attention. Abruptly it flew to the top of the\neyrie, where it seemed to be having a consultation with its bird\ncompanions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then abruptly it happened. The cockatoos took off in mass flight. A\ngroup of Earth people suddenly materialized on the eyrie, talking and\nmoving about as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a shock I saw the likeness of myself; I saw Ezra Karn; and I saw\nthe image of Jimmy Baker.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   real\n  </i>\n  Jimmy Baker stood next to Grannie, staring up at this\nincredible mirage. Grannie let out a whoop. \"I've got it!\" she said.\n\"Those things we see up there are nothing more than mental images.\nThey're Xartal's drawings!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you see,\" the lady continued. \"Everything that Xartal put on\npaper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoos\nare like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the power\nof copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mental\nimage of what they have seen. In other words their brains form a\npowerful photographic impression of the object. That impression is\nthen transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to common\nfoci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brain\nvibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the light\nfield to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Larynx manager nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"But why don't the\nbirds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and\nmade a greater impression on their brains,\" Grannie replied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicate\nof Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and the\nimage of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry,\" the operator said. \"I've used too much power already. Have to\ngive the generators a chance to build it up again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That explains something at any rate,\" the old prospector said. \"But\nhow about that Red spot fever?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I opened\nit and found it contained the case histories of those men who had been\nattacked by the strange malady.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient had\nreceived the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but while\nsleeping or lounging in the barracks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp that\nled to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a low\nrectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In those\nbunks some thirty men lay sleeping.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stood\nthere, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walk\ntoward that window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look here,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dull\nmetal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The central\npart of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and as\nI seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-red\nrays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens to\nconcentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockwork\nserved a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lens\nslowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.\nBack in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Turn it on!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.\nI stared with open eyes.

Grannie Annie was there, but seated at the\ncontrols was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ezra Karn jabbed my elbow. \"Grannie's coming back. I thought she'd be\ngetting sick of this blamed moon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It didn't make sense. In all the years I'd known Annabella C. Flowers,\nnever yet had I seen her desert a case until she had woven the clues\nand facts to a logical conclusion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ezra,\" I said, \"we're going to drive out and meet them. There's\nsomething screwy here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten minutes later in another kite car we were driving at a fast clip\nthrough the powdery sands of the Baldric. And before long we saw\nanother car approaching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Grannie. As the car drew up alongside I saw her sitting in her\nprim way next to Antlers Park. Park said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We left the others at the mine. Miss Flowers is going back with me to\nmy offices to help me improve the formula for that new antitoxin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waved his hand, and the car moved off. I watched it as it sped\nacross the desert, and a growing suspicion began to form in my mind.\nThen, like a knife thrust, the truth struck me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ezra!\" I yelled, swinging the car. \"That wasn't Grannie!\n  <i>\n   That was one\nof those damned cockatoo images.\n  </i>\n  We've got to catch him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other car was some distance ahead now. Park looked back and saw us\nfollowing. He did something to the kite wire, and his car leaped ahead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I threw the speed indicator hard over. Our kite was a huge box affair\nwith a steady powerful pull to the connecting wire. Park's vehicle\nwas drawn by a flat triangular kite that dove and fluttered with each\nvariance of the wind. Steadily we began to close in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The manager of Interstellar Voice turned again, and something glinted\nin his hand. There was a flash of purple flame, and a round hole\nappeared in our windscreen inches above Karn's head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heat gun!\" Ezra yelled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now we were rocketing over the sand dunes, winding in and out between\nthe flagpole trees. I had to catch that car I told myself. Grannie\nAnnie's very life might be at stake, not to mention the lives of\nhundreds of mine workers. Again Park took aim and again a hole\nshattered our windscreen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wind shifted and blew from another quarter. The box kite soared,\nbut the triangular kite faltered. Taking advantage of Park's loss of\nspeed, I raced alongside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The I. V. manager lifted his weapon frantically. But before he could\nuse it a third time, Ezra Karn had whipped a lariat from his belt and\nsent it coiling across the intervening space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thong yanked tight about the manager's throat. Park did the only\nthing he could do. He shut off power, and the two cars coasted to a\nhalt. Then I was across in the other seat, wrenching the weapon free\nfrom his grasp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What have you done with Miss Flowers?\" I demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The manager's eyes glittered with fear as he saw my finger tense on the\ntrigger. Weakly he lifted an arm and pointed to the northwest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Val-ley. Thir-ty miles. Entrance hidden by wall of ... flagpole trees.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I leaped into the driver's seat and gave the kite its head. And now the\ncountry began to undergo a subtle change. The trees seemed to group\nthemselves in a long flanking corridor in a northwesterly direction, as\nif to hide some secret that lay beyond. Twice I attempted to penetrate\nthat wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert began\nagain. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard as\ngranite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distance\nblack bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm or\ndoorway between.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off power\nwith an exclamation of astonishment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it was\nGrannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Grannie!\" I yelled. \"What're you doing here? Where's Mr. Baker?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She rose to her feet and clambered down the rock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Getting back Jimmy's mine laborers,\" she said, a twinkle in her eyes.\n\"I see you've got Antlers Park. I'm glad of that. It saves me a lot of\ntrouble.\" She took off her spectacles and wiped them on her sleeve.\n\"Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy. Come along, and I'll show you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deep\ngorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressing\nclose. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line of\nLarynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving down\nthe center of the gorge toward the entrance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreen\nhad been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-like\ncontrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft of\nbluish radiance spewed from its open end. Playing it back and forth\nupon the marching men were Jimmy Baker and Xartal, the Martian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ultra violet,\" Grannie Annie explained. \"The opposite end of the\nvibratory scale and the only thing that will combat the infra-red rays\nthat cause red spot fever. Those men won't stop walking until they've\nreached Shaft Four.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie told her story during the long ride back to Shaft Four.\nWe drove slowly, keeping the line of marching Larynx miners always\nahead of us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix, a lode which if\nworked successfully would see\n  <i>\n   Larynx Incorporated\n  </i>\n  become a far more\npowerful exporting concern than\n  <i>\n   Interstellar Voice\n  </i>\n  .

But Grannie only pretended to contract the plague.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Park then attempted to outwit Ezra Karn and me by returning in Jimmy\nBaker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I listened to all this in silence. \"But,\" I said when she had finished,\n\"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine\nlaborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grannie Annie frowned. \"I'm not sure I can answer the first of those\nquestions,\" she replied. \"You must remember Antlers Park has been on\nthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted\nhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens\nbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master\ncontrolling unit located in that valley.

They travel to Larynx Incorporated’s offices with Jimmy, where he learns all of the workers from Shaft Four have left their posts due to the fever. Coincidentally, that is also their most productive ore location. Jimmy, Grannie, and Xartal take off to Shaft Four via the Baldric to investigate what is going on.

The moon was known for Acoustix, an ore that allows aging Martians to improve their supersonic telecommunication abilities. They traveled through the desert to an area called the Baldric, which was filled with cat-tail-like trees and silver cockatoo-like creatures. Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice (an Acoustix mining company) had told them about the area. As they continued on, the group had a shock: they saw duplicates of themselves traveling toward them. It was not a simple mirage, as they could hear the others talking. Once they got close, however, the doubles disappeared. Shaking off the odd situation, the group continued, and eventually ran into Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, the competitors of Interstellar Voice. It seemed Jimmy needed Grannie's help: his workers at the mine had been falling sick with Red Spot Fever, which made them wander into the Baldric. The group headed to the Larynx Incorporated offices, where Jimmy admitted that calling off the mining expedition would mean the end of Jimmy's company, so he needed to combat the Fever. Grannie grabbed supplies from Jimmy's laboratory and they headed to the desert with Xartal. Ezra and Billy stayed to look around the offices, and briefly talked to Antlers Park on the visiphone. He had less issue with the Fever, but had an antitoxin that he was willing to share with Jimmy. Through a camera on Jimmy's car, Billy was able to watch the group in the desert as another set of mirages appeared. Grannie excitedly realized that the cockatoos on the moon were copying Xartal's drawings, mimicking the mental images and causing these \"mirages\". Ezra and Billy headed to Jimmy's office to investigate reports, realizing that everyone fell sick in the barracks, not while mining. They found a lens in the barracks that was pushing concentrated rays towards the workers, so they ran to the visiscreen room to find out where Grannie was. They were surprised to see Antlers Park was the only person in the car with Grannie, Jimmy and Xartal nowhere to be seen. Ezra and Billy drove out to meet them, where Billy realized this was a cockatoo and not the actual Grannie. Antlers Park eventually gave up the information about where he had left Grannie and the others, and when Billy and Ezra found them, Grannie showed them the blue ultraviolet light that had been set up to counteract the red rays that cause the fever. It seemed that the lens amplifying the rays to cause the fever was placed in Jimmy's company's barracks by Antlers' company, and the Red Spot Fever was a plan to keep Jimmy's company from becoming more successful than Antlers'.

On the moon, the team unites at the offices of Interstellar Voice, a company managed by Antlers Park. Upon Billy's arrival, Antlers updates him on the history of the company; Interstellar Voice and their rival company Larynx Incorporated mine the moon for its resource of an ore called Acoustix, which is popular amongst Martians because of its ability to revitalize their supersonic vocalizations that dwindle around middle age. Between the properties of these two companies stretches a vast desert known as the Baldric, which is home to a bird-like species resembling cockatoos as well as flagpole trees. Grannie Annie plans to cross in order to further observe the moon's environment and make way to Larynx Incorporated. Antlers Park warns them vaguely of danger in the Baldric, but the team leaves anyway. During the course of their journey, they observe the cockatoos and discover their ability to mimic human voices.

He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with\ndelight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the\nocean at last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No\nsign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny\nof brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going\nto the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange\nwhirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that\nsome object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged\nthe thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"\nHe shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple\nclouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder\nhow tall the trees really were.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:\nthe milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools\nhad stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,\nits transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the\nheavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and\nnimbi.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie\nhurried toward the ocean.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to\nsee and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen\nthe wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his\nbrothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could\nremember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,\nas he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he\nwere already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to\nplay on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical\nthree-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many\nkinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this\nday just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this\nhis fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and\neven for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and\nwouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee—just wait and see!\" As he passed one of\nthe many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took\ncare not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When\nPurnie had stopped time, the bees—like all the other creatures he\nmet—had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as\nsoon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far\noff, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was\nclearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he\nhad been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying\nfar from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an\nhour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.\nHe chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop\ntime without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends\nwhen they learned of his brave journey.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to\ngather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch\nduring this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a\ndozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came\nout as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves\nawaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along\nthe shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already\nexploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth\norange curls waiting to start that action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were\nfrozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had\nheard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers\nin school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the\nbeach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing\nthe spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight\nmore, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted\nanimation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin\nnothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical\ntripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers\nof munching seaweed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that\nhe himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of\ntime-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would\ncontinue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he\nexpected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by\nactivity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\nthe dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\ncontinue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\npicked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\ntheir leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\npollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\ndelicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been\ninterrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed\nwith continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,\nnot the world around him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the\ntripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself\nbottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in\nposition. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever\ndone, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its\nmark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long\nenough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its\nrepast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at\nonce. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided\nto a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of\nthe two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi\nthere!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes\nseventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are\nyou going to do with them—mount them on the wall of your den back in\nSan Diego?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than\nstartled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.\nHe scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,\ntagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at\nthe scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this\nexpedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in\ntheir heels.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's\nyour money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you\nhired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just\nwhat I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety\nof the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to\nbring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the\nocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty\nminutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find\nwild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little\ncreatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men\nlook around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\nwill you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\njoy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\nhe got an upside down view of them walking away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\nWhat was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\nmore of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\ntrying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\nhis lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\nwent down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\nvicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make\nyou so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I\nbelieve.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've\ndiscovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that\nflag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his\nclaim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively\nnow!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the\nfirst two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the\nbase of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high\nto carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will\nslide down on top of us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well—that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be\nsolid. It's got to stand at least—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with\nthe flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a\nflag.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set\ndown by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it\nrepresents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags\nis the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it\nsentiment if you will.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?\nWhat I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow\nsystem so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own\nthe people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!\nIt's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your\nspace ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money\ninto a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from\nthirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in\nthe strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and\nas they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to\nhimself, content to be in their company.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see\nthe remainder of the group running toward them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the\nscintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about that, Miles?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Purnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.\nThankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"\nHe was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful\nnoises, and he felt most satisfied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little\nchuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you\nsuppose—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard\nput to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he\nstood on one leg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,\nthey can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of\nthese creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools\non Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors\n  <i>\n   flocking\n  </i>\n  to me. How about it, Benson—does pioneering pay off or\ndoesn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be\ngreat danger to the crew—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now look here! You had planned to put\n  <i>\n   mineral\n  </i>\n  specimens in a lead\nbox, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He'll die.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and\nwhat's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day\nhad brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,\nthe strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle\nhappily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their\nown tricks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped\nback and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.\nPurnie sat up to watch the show.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no\nintention of running away.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what\npowers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in\nopen-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand—on the\nspot where Purnie had been standing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My God, he's—he's gone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his\nhand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\n\"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What\ndid you do with him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for\nto them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of\nwas that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around\nin front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that\nyou've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that\nfuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that\ngun!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his\nfriends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\nSlowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\ndistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\nthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\nfilled him with hysteria.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\nOthers were pinned down on the sand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He\nhopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\nshame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\nhis ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?\nPlease get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\ndone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\ntell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\nabout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.\nThe sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of\ndeath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to\ndrown!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us\nhere in the water—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's—\" His sounds were cut off by a\nwavelet gently rolling over his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the\nanimals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding\nthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he\ntugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked\nslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry—at least, not as far\nas his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition\nof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\nhe started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,\nwhere a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The\nhand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the\nlogs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after\nanother until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he\nstarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.\nHe removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting\nposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.\nAnother, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into\na new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the\nchaotic scene before him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of\ntime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without\nhim. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,\nhe knew he must first resume time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then\nto consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too\nlate. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the\nknoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered\ntime to resume, nothing happened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died\nthe oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he\nwanted to see them safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no\n  <i>\n   urging\n  </i>\n  time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,\nfirst slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He\nhad to take one viewpoint or the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took\ncommand....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  His friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach\nand pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over\nPurnie as sounds came from the animal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!\nWhat's happening?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man—I saw it, too. We're either\ncrazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,\nwe're both cracking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.\nI was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're\npiled up over there!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain\nBenson!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you men all right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes sir, but—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain.

We've got to round up the\nothers and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what happened, Captain?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old\nthey're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one.

By the light of the twin moons\nhe saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and\nthree, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the\ncurving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far\nbehind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See Forbes up ahead there?

He knows that time-stopping is forbidden for animals his age, but he chooses to believe that his family will be proud of his bravery. \n\nFinally, he sees the ocean in front of him, and he resumes time. He does a head-stand and feels weak and dizzy. These feelings are a result of the time-stop, and he knows it. Purnie approaches some humans on the beach. A man named Forbes is in the middle of explaining to his captain, Benson, that he has found 17 planets to claim as his own. Forbes is hellbent on raising his FORBES flag as soon as possible. He is eager to stake his claim to the land and says that his mission is much bigger than real estate alone. Benson retorts that yes, his mission is bigger than just real estate because his paperwork says that Forbes will own all of the inhabitants of the planets he claims as well as the land. \n\nThe crew members use a special machine and  find radiation emanating from Purnie. Forbes demands that they put the animal in a box. Benson protests and reminds Forbes that it’s against Universal Law, but Forbes insists.

He deliberately stops time and uses all of his remaining strength to lift the logs off of the humans. Purnie begins to lose consciousness, and he knows that he must resume time or he will die. After pouring all of his strength into this action, time does begin again. The humans resume life and feel as though they have gone mad.

Before arriving at the beach, he gathers some fruit for lunch and then pauses atop a small, rocky hill from where he takes in his first view of the ocean. Purnie is overwhelmed and thrilled at the idea of making friends with the new animals he sees: three-legged tripons, a flock of spora, and, further down, a group of ten humans making their way onto the beach. When he unfreezes time, Purnie climbs down the rockpile and runs around the beach, showing his new animal friends his headstand technique. Next, he visits two humans, who barely notice his presence. Captain Benson is the hired leader of the expedition; Forbes is a wealthy real estate investor who owns seventeen planets and considers himself a \"pioneer\". Forbes explains to Benson that coming to the planet is a mere formality as he has already staked his claim to make this planet his eighteenth; planting a flag emblazoned with his name is a symbolic gesture. Benson's men wish to explore the new planet and its native species, but Forbes is impatient to build his flagpole and leave.

Benson has a sensitive reasoning that Forbes does not possess, like when he thinks it possible Purnie may just come along without being sealed in the box, and when he wonders why Purnie would return to rescue the men that had tried to capture him.\n"}]}, {"question_text": "Describe the setting of the story.", "question_number": 3, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "854530e8f8534a138e1789433cc58ac3", "response_text": "The unnamed planet where the story takes place is breathtaking, colorful, and lively with all sorts of fauna and flora unknown to Earth.

The forest ends at a rocky knoll formed by petrified logs that overlooks the sea with its orange waves higher than a house and breakers coming onto the shore. There is a flock of birds called spora who land on the beach in a deep glide and humorous three-legged tripons that stand in the water and eat seaweed.

When the humans throw a noose at him in an attempt to capture him, he is shocked to find that his body instinctively runs from it. He doesn’t really experience the fear because he wants to play with them and has no interest in leaving the fun, but his natural impulses as an animal save his life at this moment. Humans have never before visited his planet, so this means that no other animal Purnie has come in contact with has made his body react this way. \nPurnie also demonstrates how evil Forbes is for trying to capture and kill such an innocent and caring animal. When Benson reminds Forbes that it’s illegal to shoot or capture Purnie, Forbes does not care at all. He wants the animal that is emitting radiation because he believes he can make a profit off of him. The value of Purnie’s life means nothing to him.

Not only does he want to be friends with every animal he encounters, but he also wants to share his lunch with them and show them his ability to do a headstand.

He listens to the funny sounds they make and follows them persistently, trying to share his lunch with them and demonstrate his headstand. When Forbes orders the men to capture him, Purnie believes they are simply playing a game, and he obliges by evading them. Even after Forbes shoots him, Purnie maintains his positive view of the humans and is more confused by what he did wrong than he is hurt by his actions. This further demonstrates Purnie's naivete and purity of heart.

He is excited that animals are radioactive because they can reproduce and provide him with an endless supply of radioactive material to make him extremely wealthy. Purnie doesn’t know this, of course, and tries to engage the men in play with him. When he realizes they want him near the box, he teasingly runs close to it then away again.

The men are puzzled at Purnie’s sudden disappearance but plan to catch him when they see him on the bluff.

Once more, Ri addressed the bearers, \"Be quick, now!\"\nAnd to Mia, \"God almighty, he was getting mad.\" He ran a hand under his\ncollar. \"It's a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did.

He may have sent a spy in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were not\nprofessional guides.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We don't want to get too near,\" Ri said after toiling through the\nforest for many minutes. \"Without guns, we don't want to get near\nenough for the farn beast to charge us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stopped. The forest was dense, the vines clinging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He'll want the bearers to hack a path for him,\" Mia said. \"But we go\nit alone. Damn him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri twisted his mouth into a sour frown. He wiped at his forehead. \"Hot.\nBy God, it's hot. I didn't think it was this hot, the first time we\nwere here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia said, \"The first time,\n  <i>\n   we\n  </i>\n  weren't guides. We didn't notice it so\nmuch then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They fought a few yards more into the forest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then it ended. Or, rather, there was a wide gap. Before them lay a\nblast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, but\nthe tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This isn't ours!\" Ri said. \"This looks like it was made nearly a year\nago!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia's eyes narrowed. \"The military from Xnile?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Ri said. \"They don't have any rockets this small. And I don't\nthink there's another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one we\nleased from the Club. Except the one\n  <i>\n   he\n  </i>\n  brought.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place?\" Mia\nasked. \"You think it's their blast?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So?\" Ri said. \"But who are they?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was Mia's turn to shrug. \"Whoever they were, they couldn't have been\nhunters. They'd have kept the secret better.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We didn't do so damned well.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We didn't have a chance,\" Mia objected. \"Everybody and his brother had\nheard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn't\nour fault Extrone found out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead of\nus.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"We should have shot our pilot,\ntoo. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who told\nExtrone we'd hunted this area.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going to\nthe alien system?

Listen. To\nhell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us,\ntoo, when the hunt's over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri licked his lips. \"No. He wouldn't do that. We're not—not just\nanybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even\n  <i>\n   him\n  </i>\n  . And besides,\nwhy would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Too\nmany people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia said, \"I hope you're right.\" They stood side by side, studying the\nblast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, \"We better be getting back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What'll we tell him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It gets hotter at sunset,\" Ri said nervously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The breeze dies down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. There\nmust be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There may be a pass,\" Mia said, pushing a vine away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. \"I guess that's it. If there were a lot\nof them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it's\ndamned funny, when you think about it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia looked up at the darkening sky. \"We better hurry,\" he said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low,\nobviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the\noutpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the\nblazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over\nExtrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled\ninto the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its\nblasts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat\ndisgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking\nofficers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce,\nthe officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and\nknees almost stiff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone\ndemanded, ominously not raising his voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it's another alien ship. It was sighted\na few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone's face looked much too innocent. \"How did it get there,\ngentlemen? Why wasn't it destroyed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So?\" Extrone mocked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could\nlocate and destroy it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned\naway, in the direction of a resting bearer. \"You!\" he said. \"Hey! Bring\nme a drink!\" He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. \"I'm\nstaying here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. \"But, sir....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone toyed with his beard. \"About a year ago, gentlemen, there was\nan alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it,\ndidn't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll destroy this one, too,\" Extrone said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through. But it might try a\nlong range bombardment, sir.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Extrone said, \"To begin with, they probably don't even know I'm here.\nAnd they probably couldn't hit this area if they did know. And you\ncan't afford to let them get a shot at me, anyway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's why we'd like you to return to an inner planet, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone plucked at his right ear lobe, half closing his eyes. \"You'll\nlose a fleet before you'll dare let anything happen to me, gentlemen.\nI'm quite safe here, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bearer brought Extrone his drink.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get off,\" Extrone said quietly to the four officers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again they turned reluctantly. This time, he did not call them back.\nInstead, with amusement, he watched until they disappeared into the\ntangle of forest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dusk was falling. The takeoff blast of the rocket illuminated the area,\ncasting weird shadows on the gently swaying grasses; there was a hot\nbreath of dry air and the rocket dwindled toward the stars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed the empty glass away,\nlistened for it to shatter. He reached out, parted the heavy flap to\nhis tent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir?\" Ri said, hurrying toward him in the gathering darkness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eh?\" Extrone said, turning, startled. \"Oh, you. Well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We ... located signs of the farn beast, sir. To the east.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, \"You killed one, I believe, on\n  <i>\n   your\n  </i>\n  trip?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri shifted. \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone held back the flap of the tent. \"Won't you come in?\" he asked\nwithout any politeness whatever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri obeyed the order.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky feathers,\ncostly of transport space, the sleep curtains of silken gauze. The\nfloor, heavy, portable tile blocks, not the hollow kind, were neatly\nand smoothly inset into the ground. Hanging from the center, to the\nleft of the slender, hand-carved center pole, was a chain of crystals.\nThey tinkled lightly when Extrone dropped the flap. The light was\nelectric from a portable dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He crossed to\nthe bed, sat down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were, I believe, the first ever to kill a farn beast?\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I.... No, sir. There must have been previous hunters, sir.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Extrone narrowed his eyes. \"I see by your eyes that you are\nenvious—that is the word, isn't it?—of my tent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri looked away from his face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I have\nnever killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't\n  <i>\n   seen\n  </i>\n  a farn beast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone's\nglittering ones. \"Few people have seen them, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh?\" Extrone questioned mildly. \"I wouldn't say that. I understand\nthat the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of their\nplanets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I meant in our system, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course you did,\" Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of his\nsleeve with his forefinger. \"I imagine these are the only farn beasts\nin our system.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri waited uneasily, not answering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Extrone said, \"I imagine they are. It would have been a shame if\nyou had killed the last one. Don't you think so?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri's hands worried the sides of his outer garment. \"Yes, sir. It would\nhave been.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone pursed his lips. \"It wouldn't have been very considerate of you\nto—But, still, you gained valuable experience. I'm glad you agreed to\ncome along as my guide.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was an honor, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. \"If I had waited until it was\nsafe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able to\nfind such an illustrious guide.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... I'm flattered, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" Extrone said. \"But you should have spoken to me about it,\nwhen you discovered the farn beast in our own system.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity,\nsir....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" Extrone said dryly. \"Like all of my subjects,\" he waved\nhis hand in a broad gesture, \"the highest as well as the lowest slave,\nknow me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri squirmed, his face pale. \"We do indeed love you, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone bent forward. \"\n  <i>\n   Know\n  </i>\n  me and love me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\n  <i>\n   Know\n  </i>\n  you and love you, sir,\" Ri said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get out!\" Extrone said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"It's frightening,\" Ri said, \"to be that close to him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two of them, beneath the leaf-swollen branches of the gnarled tree,\nwere seated on their sleeping bags. The moon was clear and cold and\nbright in a cloudless sky; a small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for a\ncentral mountain ridge that bisected it into almost twin hemispheres.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To think of him. As flesh and blood. Not like the—well; that—what\nwe've read about.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia glanced suspiciously around him at the shadows. \"You begin to\nunderstand a lot of things, after seeing him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri picked nervously at the cover of his sleeping bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It makes you think,\" Mia added. He twitched. \"I'm afraid. I'm afraid\nhe'll.... Listen, we'll talk. When we get back to civilization. You,\nme, the bearers. About him. He can't let that happen. He'll kill us\nfirst.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. \"No. We have friends. We have\ninfluence. He couldn't just like that—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He could say it was an accident.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Ri said stubbornly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He can say anything,\" Mia insisted. \"He can make people believe\nanything. Whatever he says. There's no way to check on it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's getting cold,\" Ri said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen,\" Mia pleaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Ri said. \"Even if we tried to tell them, they wouldn't listen.\nEverybody would\n  <i>\n   know\n  </i>\n  we were lying. Everything they've come to\nbelieve would tell them we were lying. Everything they've read, every\npicture they've seen. They wouldn't believe us.\n  <i>\n   He\n  </i>\n  knows that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen,\" Mia repeated intently. \"This is important. Right now he\ncouldn't afford to let us talk. Not right now. Because the Army is\nnot against him. Some officers were here, just before we came back. A\nbearer overheard them talking. They don't\n  <i>\n   want\n  </i>\n  to overthrow him!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri's teeth, suddenly, were chattering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's another lie,\" Mia continued. \"That he protects the people from\nthe Army. That's a lie. I don't believe they were\n  <i>\n   ever\n  </i>\n  plotting\nagainst him. Not even at first. I think they\n  <i>\n   helped\n  </i>\n  him, don't you\nsee?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri whined nervously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's like this,\" Mia said. \"I see it like this. The Army\n  <i>\n   put\n  </i>\n  him in\npower when the people were in rebellion against military rule.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ri swallowed. \"We couldn't make the people believe that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No?\" Mia challenged. \"Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?\nYou'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the\nalien system!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The people won't support them,\" Ri answered woodenly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Think.\n  </i>\n  If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri looked around at the shadows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That explains a lot of things,\" Mia said. \"I think the Army's been\npreparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's why\nExtrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them from\nlearning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keep\nthem from exposing\n  <i>\n   him\n  </i>\n  to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooled\nlike we were, so easy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" Ri snapped. \"It was to keep the natural economic balance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know that's not right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri lay down on his bed roll. \"Don't talk about it. It's not good to\ntalk like this. I don't even want to listen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When the invasion starts, he'll have to command\n  <i>\n   all\n  </i>\n  their loyalties.\nTo keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then.\nHe'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying to\ntell the truth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mia smiled twistedly. \"How many has he already killed? How can we even\nguess?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri swallowed sickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri shuddered. \"That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all like\nthat.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  With morning came birds' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells.\nThe air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike,\nuncontaminated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting the\nflap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared around\nthe camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Breakfast!\" he shouted, and two bearers came running with a folding\ntable and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray of\nvarious foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcher\nand a drinking mug.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone ate hugely, with none of the delicacy sometimes affected in his\nconversational gestures. When he had finished, he washed his mouth with\nwater and spat on the ground.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lin!\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His personal bearer came loping toward him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you read that manual I gave you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone pushed the table away. He smacked his lips wetly. \"Very\nludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen for\nguides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me,\ntwenty years ago, damn them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The farn beasts are dangerous, sir,\" Lin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did the manual say about them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I believe they're carnivorous, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the only\ninformation on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual—and, of\ncourse, two businessmen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They have very long, sharp fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of\ntearing a man—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An alien?\" Extrone corrected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's not enough difference between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an\nalien to pieces, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone laughed harshly. \"It's 'sir' whenever you contradict me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin's face remained impassive. \"I guess it seems that way. Sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damned few people would dare go as far as you do,\" Extrone said. \"But\nyou're afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin shrugged. \"Maybe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can see you are. Even my wives are. I wonder if anyone can know how\nwonderful it feels to have people\n  <i>\n   all\n  </i>\n  afraid of you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The farn beasts, according to the manual....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are very insistent on one subject.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... It's the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as I\nwas saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, of\naliens. Sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" Extrone said, annoyed. \"I'll be careful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the distance, a farn beast coughed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instantly alert, Extrone said, \"Get the bearers! Have some of them cut\na path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get\nthe hell over here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Four hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked\nleisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at\nthe vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their\nsharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy\nbreathing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank\ndeeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made\noppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen\nfought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks\nfor farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the\ntree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a\npowerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained\nfire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a\nfolding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered\ntwo-way communication set.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny,\narboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to\nExtrone's satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers\nslump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume,\nhe sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted,\nreflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be\nimportant.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The\nbearer twiddled the dials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother\nme?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right\nin the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!\" Extrone\ntore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back,\nfind out what they want, first. I don't want to be bothered unless it's\nimportant.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and\nperspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining\nbearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes.\n\"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About\na quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone's eyes lit with passion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin's face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I\nthink.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward\nand look at the spoor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood\nup.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\" Lin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One is enough in\n  <i>\n   my\n  </i>\n  camp.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The two of them went forward, alone, into the forest. Extrone moved\nagilely through the tangle, following Lin closely. When they came to\nthe tracks, heavily pressed into drying mud around a small watering\nhole, Extrone nodded his head in satisfaction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This way,\" Lin said, pointing, and once more the two of them started\noff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They went a good distance through the forest, Extrone becoming more\nalert with each additional foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with a\nrestraining hand. \"They may be quite a way ahead. Hadn't we ought to\nbring up the column?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The farn beast, somewhere beyond a ragged clump of bushes, coughed.\nExtrone clenched the blast rifle convulsively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The farn beast coughed again, more distant this time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're moving away,\" Lin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn!\" Extrone said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a good thing the wind's right, or they'd be coming back, and\nfast, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eh?\" Extrone said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They charge on scent, sight, or sound. I understand they will track\ndown a man for as long as a day.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait,\" Extrone said, combing his beard. \"Wait a minute.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look,\" Extrone said. \"If that's the case, why do we bother tracking\nthem? Why not make them come to us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're too unpredictable. It wouldn't be safe. I'd rather have\nsurprise on our side.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't seem to see what I mean,\" Extrone said. \"\n  <i>\n   We\n  </i>\n  won't be\nthe—ah—the bait.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's get back to the column.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Extrone wants to see you,\" Lin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy.\n\"What's he want to see\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  for?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know,\" Lin said curtly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously\nat Lin's bare forearm. \"Look,\" he whispered. \"You know him. I have—a\nlittle money. If you were able to ... if he wants,\" Ri gulped, \"to\n  <i>\n   do\n  </i>\n  anything to me—I'd pay you, if you could....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You better come along,\" Lin said, turning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound,\nineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where\nExtrone was seated, petting his rifle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone nodded genially. \"The farn beast hunter, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. \"Tell me\nwhat they look like,\" he said suddenly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, sir, they're ... uh....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pretty frightening?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  weren't afraid of them, were you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir. No, because....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone was smiling innocently. \"Good. I want you to do something for\nme.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ... I....\" Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye.\nLin's face was impassive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of\n  <i>\n   course\n  </i>\n  you will,\" Extrone said genially. \"Get me a rope, Lin. A\ngood, long, strong rope.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you going to do?\" Ri asked, terrified.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as\nbait.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream—you\n  <i>\n   can\n  </i>\n  scream,\nby the way?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri swallowed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We could find a way to make you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was perspiration trickling down Ri's forehead, a single drop,\ncreeping toward his nose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll be safe,\" Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. \"I'll\nshoot the animal before it reaches you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri gulped for air. \"But ... if there should be more than one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone shrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—Look, sir. Listen to me.\" Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands\nwere trembling. \"It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir.\n  <i>\n   He\n  </i>\n  killed a farn beast before\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  did, sir. And last night—last\nnight, he—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He what?\" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. \"He said he ought to kill you, sir.\nThat's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you.\nHe's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident,\nsir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I\nwouldn't....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone said, \"Which one is he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That one. Right over there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The one with his back to me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle\nand said, \"Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri was greenish. \"You ... you....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone turned to Lin. \"Tie one end around his waist.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait,\" Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. \"You don't\nwant to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anything\nshould happen to me.... Please, sir. Don't do it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tie it,\" Extrone ordered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir. Please. Oh,\n  <i>\n   please\n  </i>\n  don't, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tie it,\" Extrone said inexorably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They were at the watering hole—Extrone, Lin, two bearers, and Ri.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since the hole was drying, the left, partially exposed bank was steep\ntoward the muddy water. Upon it was green, new grass, tender-tuffed,\nhalf mashed in places by heavy animal treads. It was there that they\nstaked him out, tying the free end of the rope tightly around the base\nof a scaling tree.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will scream,\" Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed\nacross the water hole. \"The farn beast will come from this direction, I\nimagine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri was almost slobbering in fear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let me hear you scream,\" Extrone said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ri moaned weakly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll have to do better than that.\" Extrone inclined his head toward\na bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Ri screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See that you keep it up that way,\" Extrone said. \"That's the way I\nwant you to sound.\" He turned toward Lin. \"We can climb this tree, I\nthink.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly, aided by the bearers, the two men climbed the tree, bark\npeeling away from under their rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once at the crotch, Extrone settled down, holding the rifle at alert.\nLin moved to the left, out on the main branch, rested in a smaller\ncrotch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking down, Extrone said, \"Scream!\" Then, to Lin, \"You feel the\nexcitement? It's always in the air like this at a hunt.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I feel it,\" Lin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extrone chuckled. \"You were with me on Meizque?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That was something, that time.\" He ran his hand along the stock of the\nweapon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled\nExtrone's head. He slapped at it, angry. The forest was quiet,\nunderlined by an occasional piping call, something like a whistle. Ri's\nscreams were shrill, echoing away, shiveringly.

Ri and Mia killed the first farn beast in their world, and when Extrone heard this, he hired them for a pittance to be his guides on a hunting expedition for the farn beast. Neither man wants to be there, but they have no choice. When Ri and Mia killed a farn beast, they killed their guide to prevent news of it from leaking, but other people still found out. Mia worries that Extrone will kill them, too, when the hunt is over, but Ri insists that they are too important for that to happen. Ri insists their friends and influence will prevent Extrone from doing that, but Mia counters that Extrone can always claim it was an accident. The two men are suspicious about how Extrone came to power, and Mia suspects that he is planning to invade the aliens and, for that reason, cut off trade with them. Ri disagrees and says the trade discontinuation was to keep an economic balance. While the two men disagree about Extrone’s methods, they both agree that he is a scary guy. At the end of the story, however, when Extrone’s plan to use Ri as live bait for the farn beast becomes clear to him, Ri lies and says Extrone should use Mia as bait because Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone has Ri point out Mia to him and then shoots him and still uses Ri for bait.

Although they successfully hunted a farn beast in the past, they are not professional guides by any means. Despite this and the low pay that they receive for their efforts, they feel compelled to meet Extrone's demands out of fear of reprisal. Mia is more assertive and confident than Ri, and he strongly believes that Extrone is a puppet leader installed by the military to ensure the people will support future military action against the aliens. Ri, fearful and timid, does not want to believe Mia's conspiracies and espouses faith in Extrone. Mia further fears that Extrone will kill them once the hunt is over because he does not want them to reveal the location of the farn beasts. Ri's fear of Extrone takes over when Extrone wants to use him as bait to catch the farn beasts, and he throws Mia under the bus by claiming Mia has suggested assassinating Extrone.

The annoyance was that\n   <br/>\n   he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did\nthe light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in\nthe gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the\nhumans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and\narrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior\nto anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was\naccustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was\nalmost ordinary-looking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—they were merely\namused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably\nhideous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a\nshort man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were\nin that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though\nnot death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic\nsurgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his\nclothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather\nugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt\nhe was, which was what mattered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry, colleague,\" Gabe said lazily. \"All my fault. You must let me\nbuy you a replacement.\" He gestured to the bartender. \"Another of the\nsame for my fellow-man here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth\nhastily supplied by the management.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,\" Gabe said, taking out\nhis wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look\nat them. \"Here, have yourself a new suit on me.\"\n  <i>\n   You could use one\n  </i>\n  was implied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,\nwas too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just\nset before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's\nhandsome face.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Suddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. \"Don't do that,\" the\nnondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed\nthe glass from the little man's slackening grasp. \"You wouldn't want to\ngo to jail because of him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces\nnow ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too\nstrong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to\nsmash back, and now it was too late for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. \"So, it's you again?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man in the gray suit smiled. \"Who else in any world would stand up\nfor you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you\naround, of course,\" Gabriel added too quickly. \"You do come in useful\nat times, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you don't mind having me around?\" The nondescript man smiled again.\n\"Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from\nyourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. \"Come on, have a drink\nwith me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you\nsomething—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I drank with you once too often,\" the nondescript man said. \"And\nthings worked out fine, didn't they? For you.\" His eyes studied the\nother man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of\nbags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were\nnot pleased with what they saw. \"Watch yourself, colleague,\" he warned\nas he left. \"Soon you might not be worth the saving.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who was that, Gabe?\" the girl asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged. \"I never saw him before in my life.\" Of course, knowing\nhim, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he\nhappened to have been telling the truth.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel\nsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\nhe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\nthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n  <i>\n   bodyguard\n  </i>\n  , he went out into the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled—shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Mrs.\n  </i>\n  ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,\nwhich was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and\nhis was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket\ncloser about her chilly body. \"Aren't you going to introduce your—your\nfriend to me, Gabe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he's\nno friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification\ncard from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and\nDominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail\nmilgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks\nago, and now he isn't ... anything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I'd like to give you some token\nof my—of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier\nwith deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only\ncasually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation\nheld little gratitude.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money,\nthank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband,\n\"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the\nfuture! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let\nsomething happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise—I'll be\ncareful.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,\nthe fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi\ndriver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the\ncommission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others\nhad been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate\nor despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known\ncolloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from\none zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you\ncould call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it\nextended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.\nPerhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn't care.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were\nmany legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word\nimplied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so\ndeliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of\n\"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to\nzarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly\napplied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as\nnature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;\notherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it\nprofitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\nlaw—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\nthe trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\neverybody else far too well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places—hoping that eventually\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\nweighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I really think Gabriel\n  <i>\n   must\n  </i>\n  be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\nto herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  the\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\nthem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\nwho go around changing their bodies like—like hats?\" Automatically she\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why do you do it?\n  <i>\n   Why!\n  </i>\n  Do you like it? Or is it because of\nGabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here\nand she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was\nincluded in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you;\nis that it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ask him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I\ndidn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what\nwe've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I\nthink?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she\nwondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or\nthird- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it\nrespond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she\nmust not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking\nfor a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not,\nshe thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so\ncasually.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her\nhusband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat—of fur taken from\nsome animal who had lived and died light-years away—more closely about\nherself. The thin young man began to cough again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk\nof the Moon and hurl itself upward—one of the interstellar ships\nembarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow\nshe could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a\nbarren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who\nfollowed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of\nthem would stay....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then\ndo you keep helping him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am not helping\n  <i>\n   him\n  </i>\n  . And he knows that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll change again tonight, won't you?\" she babbled. \"You always\nchange after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to\nidentify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's\nsomething about you that doesn't change.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed\nhim for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out\nfrom the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice\nless impersonal, \"for your sake.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but\nshe would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an\noutsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had\nknown Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect\nthat he was even more closely involved than that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the\nsubject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the\nrisk of getting a bad one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This isn't a good body,\" he said. \"It's diseased. Sure, nobody's\nsupposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical\nexamination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading\nme, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty\nof foliage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How—long will it last you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Four or five months, if I'm careful.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry, if\nthat's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be\nexpensive—that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then\nit was tough on me too, wasn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why\nare you doing it?\" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard\nfor fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should\nknow him better than most.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ask your husband.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,\nsnow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,\nand stirred it with his toe. \"I'd better call a cab—he might freeze to\ndeath.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He signaled and a cab came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell him, when he comes to,\" he said to the girl as he and the driver\nlifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, \"that I'm\ngetting pretty tired of this.\" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.\n\"Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't,\nin the long run, be most beneficial for my face.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect\nexcept for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I'm afraid you\ncannot play.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz\nshrugged. \"I'll pay you twice the regular fee.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This\ngame is really clean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In a town like this?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz' tendrils\nquivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through\nlong, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz.

Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game.\nHe never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration.\nAnd even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he\nwouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was\nhe changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own\ndiscoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact\nthat none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him?\nWas he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the\nhazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day\nwin another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original\ncasing had?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't know.

He himself had been a fool to admit to her that\nthe hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand\nhow he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of\ninformation.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they\ndetached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it\nhappens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions\nto be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good\nhealth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured\naloud. \"A criminal then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The green one's face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Male?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate\nstandards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the\ncurious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it\nkept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had\nalso never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials\nexchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or\nbiological impossibility, no one could tell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part—if it had ever\nbeen proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body,\nEarthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held\nits self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite\nbeing unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists.

It was a terrific\nrisk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he\nhimself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all\nthe crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;\ntall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to\nmatch the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many\npeople who might find this one preferable. No identification in the\npockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it\nwas a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful\nstudent of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from\ntime immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he\nmight one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of\nthe men depicted there.

The stranger visits a locker at a nearby airstation, puts most of his belongings inside, including all forms of identification, and sets the lock to the word \"bodyguard\". He climbs into a helicab, where he pressures the driver into taking him to a zarquil game. This man has been floating around without an identity, but operates as a flying dutchman, floating between zarquil games. Another day, Lockard crashes a helicar on a rainy fall night in a dark corner of a degrading city, and a fat stranger pulls him and his wife out of the helicar before it exploded. The man who saved them has the ID of Dominic Bianchi, a milgot dealer who seems to have disappeared in the past few weeks. Mrs. Lockard warns her husband to be more careful lest something happen to him. It seems the stranger's job is to rotate identities and protect Lockard. On yet another day, a thin stranger chases off a thief with his gun, and checks in on Mr. and Mrs. Lockard.

She wants to know why, but the stranger suggests she ask Gabriel. She suspects they've been running from this stranger, and has started to be able to identify him, which the stranger is disappointed by as he explains it is not Gabriel he is helping. Because Gabriel is going to run-down cities, the bodies the stranger is getting are not well-vetted, and can't last too long. It turns out the stranger was the original Gabriel Lockard, the implication being that he's trying to protect his original body. As the stranger tries to swap bodies again, he finds that nobody wants the one he's in. He's offered a body that is healthy but likely a criminal, for three times the usual fee, and the stranger accepts the expensive deal. After the bodyswap, he recognizes the man as someone police are ordered to burn on sights. Mrs. Lockard interrogates her husband about his stolen body, which starts an argument.

When the stranger ends up with a sick body near the end of the story, his only option is to accept a body with a criminal past because nobody will accept an ill body at a reputable game. Public perception shows that society looks down on these games. The cab driver that the stranger meets explicitly says that he looks down on dutchmen, saying he hates them, and very reluctantly takes the stranger to a zarquil game because he is promised the money and he knows the stranger has a gun. It is this game that caused the original Gabriel Lockard to lose his body and identity, and it is through this game that he rotates through nameless people in order to follow the new Lockard to keep an eye on the body. \n"}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "4f41c38b37cc4119a4348535244076dc", "response_text": "The zarquil games are illegally run by the Vinzz, an alien race. The illegal operation has such a terrible reputation that one of the cab drivers the stranger encounters suggests that he kill himself rather than playing. The cab driver almost refuses to bring him to the games, but he sees the amount of cash the stranger is holding and agrees to do his bidding. Many people in the society know nothing about zarquil because it’s an underground game that people with good reputations do not take part in. The stranger is known as a “dutchman,” which is a term for someone who plays zarquil all the time for the rush of it. \n\nZarquil is an interesting phenomenon because both the victim and the perpetrator are both considered guilty. The game is very expensive to play, and that’s why the Vinzz spend their time running the activity for humans. The Vinzz use the money they make to return to their home planet of Vinau and purchase slaves. The aliens rarely get in trouble for hosting the games because the Vinzz live about 2,000 years, and therefore no punishment would be worthwhile. The Vinzz are not subjected to capital punishment because the humans don’t know if their weapons are good enough to kill them. \n\nMales are given male bodies, and females are given female bodies. The Vinzz do not play “mixed games” and switch up genders, even though there is surely a market for that. Humans are also not allowed to trade bodies with aliens. The Vinzz feel that if they successfully traded a human body for an alien one, the humans would become outraged and start a war over the matter. Some seedy zarquil games include private purchases of criminal bodies. Criminals do not pass the standard testing and must be bought in secret. \n\nThe zarquil games are an important part of the story because Gabe Lockard loses his body to the stranger in one of these illegal games. The stranger, or the real Gabe Lockard, then uses zarquil to continuously change bodies to go undetected by the fake Gabe Lockard. He wants to get his real body back, and in order to do that he must not let the fake Gabe Lockard know his true identity. \n"}, {"worker_id": "10", "uid": "beb41634158d4082844e490a3240e552", "response_text": "Zarquil is an extremely illegal “crime against nature” sport which is akin to a game of musical chairs. Instead of trading chairs, the game is a high consequence one where humans trade bodies. Supposedly the entrants to the game have a physical health check to ensure the participants get into bodies free of disease, but this proves to not be well regulated as the stranger receives several bodies which he thinks are “diseased”.\n\nThe sport is run by aliens, Vinzz, from Altair’s seventh planet that have no regard for the welfare of the humans playing, only the profits. The game persists on Terra (where humans live in the story) because there is no capital punishment that can be brought upon the Vinzz, as they live over 2000 years, making prison sentences useless to discourage them from running the game.\n\nThe games are significant because they allow humans to escape their lives by changing into completely different identities. This can enable criminals to escape the law, or for a single person to follow others undetected by continuously changing appearances.\n"}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "c7dd20d7f0f04817961ecd8b481324d5", "response_text": "The zarquil games are an illegal activity played by people referred to as dutchmen who go from one game to another seeking the thrills they get from it. Part of the thrill of the game was the unknown; players don’t know for sure what kind of body they will end up with. The games are very expensive and are run by the Vinzz, who are strange beings from Altair’s seventh planet Vinau. The Vinzz have no concerns for the humans playing their games; they are running the games strictly for the money they can make from them so that they can return to Vinau and buy many slaves. The Vinzz live for around two thousand earth years and bodies mean little to them; they care nothing about a human’s body. The Vinzz are not barred from coming to Earth to run their games because the trade between the two planets is so valuable that they maintain peace. In the games, people exchange bodies. The Vinzz are supposed to vet everyone who plays to make sure their bodies are healthy, but they have been known to cut corners when profits are lagging. This explains why the stranger ends up as the sickly, thin man who only has four or five months left to live. \nThe zarquil games are significant in the story because that is how the stranger lost his body and name to the current Gabe Lockard. Apparently, the stranger drank too much too many times and played the zarquil game, losing his body and identity. He continues playing the game, changing his identity after every interaction with the current Gabe. The stranger isn’t sure whether he keeps changing after interacting with the current Gabe because of his interaction or because none of the subsequent bodies feel right to him.

The sun\nrose with its bright, silent clap of radiance. Black pools of shadows\nlay in harsh contrast, their edges drawn with geometric precision.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship attempted unsuccessfully to communicate with Base\nGagarin. \"Will you please request the general to keep us informed on\nthe progress of the countdown?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply. \"Help?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Nyet\n  </i>\n  ,\" said Major Winship, exhausting his Russian. \"Count down.\nProgress. When—boom?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Boom! Boom!\" said Major Winship in exasperation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Boom!\" said Pinov happily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Boom—boom!\" said Pinov.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, nuts.\" Major Winship cut out the circuit. \"They've got Pinov on\nemergency watch this morning,\" he explained to the other Americans.\n\"The one that doesn't speak English.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's done it deliberately,\" said Capt. Wilkins, the eldest of the four\nAmericans. \"How are we going to know when it's over?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  No one bothered to respond. They sat for a while in silence while the\nshadows evaporated. One by one they clicked on their cooling systems.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ultimately, Lt. Chandler said, \"This is a little ridiculous. I'm going\nto switch over to their channel. Rap if you want me.\" He sat transfixed\nfor several minutes. \"Ah, it's all Russian. Jabbering away. I can't\ntell a thing that's going on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the airless void of the moon, the blast itself would be silent. A\nmoth's wing of dust would, perhaps, rise and settle beyond the horizon:\nno more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Static?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nope.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll get static on these things.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A small infinity seemed to pass very slowly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship shifted restlessly. \"My reefer's gone on the fritz.\"\nPerspiration was trickling down his face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's all go in,\" said the fourth American, Capt. Lawler. \"It's\nprobably over by now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll try again,\" Major Winship said and switched to the emergency\nchannel. \"Base Gagarin? Base Gagarin?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is Pinov. Help?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Nyet.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pinov's still there,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell him, 'Help',\" said Capt. Wilkins, \"so he'll get somebody we can\ntalk to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll see them all in hell, first,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later, the perspiration was rivers across his face. \"This\nis it,\" he said. \"I'm going in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's all—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. I've got to cool off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hell, Charlie, I feel stupid sitting out here,\" Capt. Lawler said.\n\"The shot probably went off an hour ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The static level hasn't gone up much, if at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"it's buried too deep.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe so,\" Major Winship said. \"But we can't have the dome fall down\naround all our ears.\" He stood. \"Whew! You guys stay put.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He crossed with the floating moon-motion to the airlock and entered,\nclosing the door behind him. The darkness slowly filled with air, and\nthe temperature inside the suit declined steadily. At the proper moment\nof pressure, the inner lock slid open and Major Winship stepped into\nthe illuminated central area. His foot was lifted for the second step\nwhen the floor beneath him rose and fell gently, pitching him forward,\noff balance. He stumbled against the table and ended up seated beside\nthe radio equipment. The ground moved again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Charlie! Charlie!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm okay,\" Major Winship answered. \"Okay! Okay!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was additional surface movement. The movement ceased.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, Les, how's it look?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay from this side. Charlie, you still okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" Major Winship said. \"We told them this might happen,\" he added\nbitterly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a wait during which everyone seemed to be holding their\nbreath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess it's over,\" said Major Winship, getting to his feet. \"Wait a\nbit more, there may be an after-shock.\" He switched once again to the\nemergency channel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is Pinov,\" came the supremely relaxed voice. \"Help?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship whinnied in disgust. \"\n  <i>\n   Nyet!\n  </i>\n  \" he snarled. To the other\nAmericans: \"Our comrades seem unconcerned.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They began to get the static for the first time. It crackled and\nsnapped in their speakers. They made sounds of disapproval at each\nother. For a minute or two, static blanked out the communications\ncompletely. It then abated to something in excess of normal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Lt. Chandler commented, \"even though we didn't build this thing\nto withstand a moonquake, it seems to have stood up all right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess I was just—\" Major Winship began. \"Oh, hell! We're losing\npressure. Where's the markers?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By the lug cabinet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Got 'em,\" Major Winship said a moment later.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He peeled back a marker and let it fall. Air currents whisked it away\nand plastered it against a riveted seam of the dome. It pulsed as\nthough it were breathing and then it ruptured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship moved quickly to cut out the emergency air supply which\nhad cut in automatically with the pressure drop. \"You guys wait. It's\non your right side, midway up. I'll try to sheet it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He moved for the plastic sheeting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've lost about three feet of calk out here,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"I\ncan see more ripping loose. You're losing pressure fast at this rate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship pressed the sheeting over the leak. \"How's that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't think I've got enough pressure left to hold it, now. It's\nsprung a little, and I can't get it to conform over the rivet heads.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a splatter of static.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn!\" Major Winship said, \"they should have made these things more\nflexible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Still coming out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Best I can do.\" Major Winship stepped back. The sheet began slowly\nto slide downward, then it fell away completely and lay limply on the\nfloor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on in,\" he said dryly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  With the four of them inside, it was somewhat cramped. Most of the\nfive hundred square feet was filled with equipment. Electrical cables\ntrailed loosely along the walls and were festooned from the ceiling,\nradiating from the connections to the outside solar cells. The living\nspace was more restricted than in a submarine, with the bunks jutting\nout from the walls about six feet from the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lt. Chandler mounted one of the bunks to give them more room. \"Well,\"\nhe said wryly, \"it doesn't smell as bad now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oops,\" said Major Winship. \"Just a second. They're coming in.\" He\nswitched over to the emergency channel. It was General Finogenov.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Major Winship! Hello! Hello, hello, hello. You A Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is Major Winship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh! Excellent, very good. Any damage, Major?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Little leak. You?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Came through without damage.\" General Finogenov paused a moment. When\nno comment was forthcoming, he continued: \"Perhaps we built a bit more\nstrongly, Major.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You did this deliberately,\" Major Winship said testily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Major Winship, please believe me. I very\nmuch regret this. Very much so. I am very distressed. Depressed. After\nrepeatedly assuring you there was no danger of a quake—and then to\nhave something like this happen. Oh, this is very embarrassing to me.\nIs there anything at all we can do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just leave us alone, thank you,\" Major Winship said and cut off the\ncommunication.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What'd they say?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Larry, General Finogenov said he was very embarrassed by this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's nice,\" Lt. Chandler said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll be damned surprised,\" Major Winship said, \"if they got any\nseismic data out of that shot.... Well, to hell with them, let's get\nthis leak fixed. Skip, can you get the calking compound?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Larry, where's the inventory?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Les has got it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lt. Chandler got down from the bunk and Capt. Wilkins mounted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Larry,\" Major Winship said, \"why don't you get Earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins got down from the bunk and Capt. Lawler ascended.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Got the inventory sheet, Les?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Squeezed in front of the massive transmitter, Capt. Wilkins had\nenergized the circuits. There was a puzzled look on his face. He leaned\nhis helmet against the speaker and then shook his head sadly. \"We can't\nhear anything without any air.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship looked at the microphone. \"Well, I'll just report and—\"\nHe started to pick up the microphone and reconsidered. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"That's right, isn't it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins flicked off the transmitter. \"Some days you don't mine at\nall,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Les, have you found it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's around here somewhere. Supposed to be back here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\n  <i>\n   find\n  </i>\n  it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lt. Chandler began moving boxes. \"I saw it—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Skip, help look.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Lawler got down from the bunk and Major Winship mounted. \"We\nhaven't got all day.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few minutes later, Lt. Chandler issued the triumphant cry. \"Here it\nis! Dozen tubes. Squeeze tubes. It's the new stuff.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship got down and Capt. Wilkins got up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Marker showed it over here,\" Major Winship said, inching over to the\nwall. He traced the leak with a metallic finger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How does this stuff work?\" Capt. Lawler asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They huddled over the instruction sheet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's see. Squeeze the tube until the diaphragm at the nozzle\nruptures. Extrude paste into seam. Allow to harden one hour before\nservice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship said dryly, \"Never mind. I notice it hardens on contact\nwith air.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins lay back on the bunk and stared upward. He said, \"Now\nthat makes a weird kind of sense, doesn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do they possibly think—?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gentlemen! It doesn't make any difference,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"Some\nair must already have leaked into this one. It's hard as a rock. A\ngorilla couldn't extrude it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How're the other ones?\" asked Major Winship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lt. Chandler turned and made a quick examination. \"Oh, they're all\nhard, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who was supposed to check?\" demanded Capt. Wilkins in exasperation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The only way you can check is to extrude it,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"and\nif it does extrude, you've ruined it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's that,\" Major Winship said. \"There's nothing for it but to yell\nhelp.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler took the land car to Base Gagarin. The\nSoviet base was situated some ten miles toward sunset at the bottom of\na natural fold in the surface. The route was moderately direct to the\ntip of the gently rolling ridge. At that point, the best pathway angled\nleft and made an S-shaped descent to the basin. It was a one-way trip\nof approximately thirty exhausting minutes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship, with his deficient reefer, remained behind. Capt.\nWilkins stayed for company.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I want a cigarette in the worst way,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So do I, Larry. Shouldn't be more than a couple of hours. Unless\nsomething else goes wrong.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As long as they'll loan us the calking compound,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, yeah,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's eat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You got any concentrate? I'm empty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll load you,\" Capt. Wilkins volunteered wearily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was an awkward operation that took several minutes. Capt. Wilkins\ncursed twice during the operation. \"I'd hate to live in this thing for\nany period.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think these suits are one thing we've got over the Russians,\" Major\nWinship said. \"I don't see how they can manipulate those bulky pieces\nof junk around.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They ate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Really horrible stuff.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nutritious.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After the meal, Major Winship said reflectively, \"Now I'd like a cup of\nhot tea. I'm cooled off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins raised eyebrows. \"What brought this on?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was just thinking.... They really got it made, Larry.

Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  After a moment, Major Winship said bitterly, \"To hell with the Russian\nengineer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you've got all that power....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the thing. That's the thing that gripes me, know what I mean?\nIt's just insane to send up a heavy wooden desk. That's showing off.\nLike a little kid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe they don't make aluminum desks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They've—got—aluminum. Half of everything on the whole planet is\naluminum. You know they're just showing off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let me wire you up,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"We ought to report.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's going to take awhile.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's something to do while we wait.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess we ought to.\" Major Winship came down from the bunk and\nsat with his back toward the transmitter. Capt. Wilkins slewed the\nequipment around until the emergency jacks were accessible. He\nunearthed the appropriate cable and began unscrewing the exterior\nplate to the small transmitter-receiver set on Major Winship's back.\nEventually, trailing wires, Major Winship was coupled into the network.\n\"Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" Major Winship gestured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They roused Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is Major Charles Winship, Commanding Officer, Freedom 19, the\nAmerican moonbase.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At this point, Major Winship observed for the first time that he was\nnow on emergency air. He started to ask Capt. Wilkins to change his\nair bottle, but then he realized his communications were cut off. He\nreached over and rapped Capt. Wilkins' helmet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is the Cape. Come in, Major Winship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just a moment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is everything all right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship was squirming nervously, obviously perturbed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A-Okay,\" he said. \"Just a moment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's wrong?\" came the worried question. In the background, he heard\nsomeone say, \"I think there's something wrong.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins peered intently. Major Winship contorted his face in a\nsavage grimace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins raised his eyebrows in alarm. They were face to face\nthrough their helmets, close together. Each face appeared monstrously\nlarge to the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship made a strangling motion and reached for his throat. One\narm tangled a cable and jerked the speaker jack loose. Major Winship\ncould no longer hear the alarmed expressions from the Cape. The effort\nwas not entirely subvocal, since he emitted a little gasping cry in\ninvoluntary realism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This, in the course of some 90 seconds, was transmitted to Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins's lips were desperately forming the word \"Leak?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Air, Major Winship said silently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Leak?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It was a frog-like, unvocal expletive.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Comprehension dawned. Capt. Wilkins nodded and started to turn away.\nMajor Winship caught his arm and nodded his head toward the loose jack.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins nodded and smiled. He reached across and plugged the\nspeaker in again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... Freedom 19! Hello, Freedom 19! Come in!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're here,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right? Are you all right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're all right. A-Okay.\" Major Winship, mindful of the extent of his\npotential audience, took a deep breath. \"Earlier this morning, the\nSoviet Union fired an underground atomic device for the\n  <i>\n   ostensible\n  </i>\n  purpose of investigating the composition of the lunar mass by means of\nseismic analysis of the resultant shock waves. This was done in spite\nof American warnings that such a disturbance might release accumulated\nstresses in the long undisturbed satellite, and was done in the face of\nvigorous American protests.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins tapped his helmet and gestured for him to swivel around.\nThe turn was uncomfortably tight and complicated by the restraining\ncables. Capt. Wilkins began replacement of the air bottle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"These protests have proved well founded,\" Major Winship continued.\n\"Immediately following the detonation, Freedom 19 was called on to\nwithstand a moderately severe shifting of the Lunar surface. No\npersonnel were injured and there was no equipment damage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins tapped his shoulder to indicate the new air bottle was\nbeing inserted. Another tap indicated it was seated. Major Winship\nflicked the appropriate chest button and nodded in appreciation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"However,\" he continued, \"we did experience a minor leak in the dome,\nwhich is presently being repaired.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Soviet Union,\" came the reply, \"has reported the disturbance and\nhas tendered their official apology. You want it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It can wait until later. Send it by mail for all I care. Vacuum has\ndestroyed our organic air reconditioner. We have approximately three\nweeks of emergency air. However, Base Gagarin reports no damage, so\nthat, in the event we exhaust our air, we will be able to obtain the\nnecessary replacement.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wait of a little better than three seconds for the response gave\nthe conversation a tone of deliberation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A new voice came on. \"We tried to contact you earlier, Major. We will\nbe able to deliver replacements in about ten days.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will forward a coded report on the occurrence,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let us hear from you again in ... about three hours. Is the leak\nrepaired?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The leak has not yet been repaired. Over and out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded to Capt. Wilkins and leaned back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Methodically, Capt. Wilkins set about disconnecting the major from the\ntransmitter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wow!\" said Major Winship when he was once more in communication. \"For\na moment there, I thought....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What?\" Capt. Wilkins asked with interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I could see myself asking them to ask the Russians to ask Finogenov\nto get on the emergency channel to ask you to charge the air bottle.\nI never felt so ... idiotic is not quite strong enough ... there for a\nminute in my whole life. I didn't know how much emergency air was left,\nand I thought, my God, I'll never live this down. All the hams in the\nworld listening, while I try to explain the situation. I could see the\nnickname being entered in my files: aka. The Airless Idiot. I tell you,\nthat was rough.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler returned with the calking compound. It\noccupied the rear section of the land car. Lt. Chandler sat atop it. It\nwas a fifty-five gallon drum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The airlock to Freedom 19 was open. \"What is\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  ?\" asked Major\nWinship, squinting out into the glaring sunlight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"is the calking compound.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're kidding,\" said Capt. Wilkins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am not kidding.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler came inside. Capt. Wilkins mounted a bunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why didn't you just borrow a cupful?\" Major Winship said sarcastically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's this way,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"They didn't have anything but\n55-gallon drums of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, my,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"I suppose it's a steel drum. Those\nthings must weigh....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Actually, I think you guys have got the general wrong,\" Capt. Lawler\nsaid. \"He was out, himself, to greet us. I think he was really quite\nupset by the quake. Probably because his people had misfigured so bad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's too damned suspicious,\" Major Winship said. \"You know and I know\nwhy they set that blast off. I tried to tell him. Hell. He looks at me\nlike an emasculated owl and wants to know our ulterior motive in trying\nto prevent a purely scientific experiment, the results of which will be\npublished in the technical press for the good of everybody. I'll bet!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About this drum,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, like I said, it's this way,\" Lt. Chandler resumed. \"I told him\nwe needed about a pint. Maybe a quart. But this stuff you have to mix\nup. He only had these drums. There's two parts to it, and you have to\ncombine them in just the right proportion. He told me to take a little\nscale—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A little scale?\" asked Capt. Wilkins, rolling his eyes at the dome.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I told him. We don't have any little scale.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" said Captain Lawler, \"and he looked at us with that mute,\nsurprised look, like everybody, everywhere has dozens of little\nscales.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, anyway,\" Lt. Chandler continued, \"he told us just to mix up the\nwhole fifty-five gallon drum. There's a little bucket of stuff that\ngoes in, and it's measured just right. We can throw away what we don't\nneed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Somehow, that sounds like him,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He had five or six of them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jesus!\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"That must be\n  <i>\n   three thousand pounds\n  </i>\n  of\ncalking compound. Those people are insane.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The question is,\" Capt. Lawler said, \"'How are we going to mix it?'\nIt's supposed to be mixed thoroughly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They thought over the problem for a while.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That will be a man-sized job,\" Major Winship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's see, Charlie. Maybe not too bad,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"If I took\nthe compressor motor, we could make up a shaft and ... let's see ... if\nwe could....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It took the better part of an hour to rig up the electric mixer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Capt. Wilkins was profusely congratulated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now,\" Major Winship said, \"we can either bring the drum inside or take\nthe mixer out there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're going to have to bring the drum in,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"that will make it nice and cozy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took the four of them to roll the drum inside, rocking it back and\nforth through the airlock. At that time, it was apparent the table was\ninterposing itself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lt. Chandler tried to dismantle the table. \"Damn these suits,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've got it stuck between the bunk post.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\n  <i>\n   know\n  </i>\n  that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't think this is the way to do it,\" Major Winship said. \"Let's\nback the drum out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reluctantly, they backed the drum out and deposited it. With the aid of\nCapt. Lawler, Lt. Chandler got the table unstuck. They passed it over\nto Major Winship, who handed it out to Capt. Wilkins. Captain Wilkins\ncarried it around the drum of calking compound and set it down. It\nrested uneasily on the uneven surface.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, let's go,\" said Major Winship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eventually, they accomplished the moving. They wedged the drum between\nthe main air-supply tank and the transmitter. They were all perspiring.\n\"It's not the weight, it's the mass,\" said Capt. Wilkins brightly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The hell it isn't the weight,\" said Lt. Chandler. \"That's heavy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With my reefer out,\" said Major Winship, \"I'm the one it's rough on.\"\nHe shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"They should figure a way to get\na mop in here, or a towel, or a sponge, or something. I'll bet you've\nforgotten how much sweat stings in the eyes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's the salt.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Speaking of salt. I wish I had some salt tablets,\" Major Winship said.\n\"I've never sweat so much since basic.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Want to bet Finogenov hasn't got a bushel of them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" Major Winship snapped.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  With the drum of calking compound inside, both Capt. Lawler and Lt.\nChandler retreated to the bunks. Capt. Wilkins maneuvered the mixing\nattachment. \"I feel crowded,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cozy's the word.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Watch it! Watch it! You almost hit me in the face plate with that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At length the mixer was in operation in the drum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Works perfectly,\" said Capt. Wilkins proudly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now what, Skip? The instructions aren't in English.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're supposed to dump the bucket of stuff in. Then clean the area\nthoroughly around the leak.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With what?\" asked Major Winship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sandpaper, I guess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"With sandpaper?\" Major Winship said, emptying the bucket of fluid into\nthe drum. \"We don't have any sandpaper.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's been a long day,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mix it thoroughly,\" Lt. Chandler mused. \"I guess that means let it mix\nfor about ten minutes or so. Then you apply it. It sets for service in\njust a little bit, Finogenov said. An hour or so, maybe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope this doesn't set on exposure to air.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"It sets by some kind of chemical action.\nGeneral Finogenov wasn't sure of the English name for it. Some kind of\nplastic.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's come back to how we're going to clean around the leak,\" Major\nWinship said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say, I—\" interrupted Capt. Wilkins. There was a trace of concern\nin his voice. \"This is a hell of a time for this to occur to\nme. I just wasn't thinking, before.\n  <i>\n   You don't suppose it's a\nroom-temperature-curing epoxy resin, do you?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Larry,\" said Major Winship, \"I wouldn't know a room-temperature-curing\nepoxy resin from—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" exclaimed Capt. Wilkins. \"The mixer's stopped.\" He bent forward\nand touched the drum. He jerked back. \"Ye Gods! that's hot! And it's\nharder than a rock! It\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  an epoxy! Let's get out of here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out! Out!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Major Winship, Lt. Chandler, and Capt. Lawler, recognizing the sense of\nurgency, simultaneously glanced at the drum. It was glowing cherry red.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go!\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He and the Major reached the airlock at the same time and became\ntemporarily engaged with each other. Movement was somewhat ungainly\nin the space suits under the best of conditions, and now, with the\nnecessity for speed, was doubly so. The other two crashed into them\nfrom behind, and they spewed forth from the dome in a tangle of arms\nand legs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the table, they separated, two going to the left, two to the right.\nThe table remained untouched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they halted, Capt. Wilkins said, \"Get to one side, it may go off\nlike shrapnel.\" They obeyed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What—what—what?\" Capt. Lawler stuttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were still separated, two on one side of the airlock, two on the\nother.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going to try to look,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Let me go.\" He\nlumbered directly away from the dome for a distance of about fifteen\nfeet, then turned and positioned himself, some five feet behind the\ntable, on a line of sight with the airlock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can see it,\" he said. \"It's getting redder. It's ... it's ...\nmelting, yes. Melting down at the bottom a little. Now it's falling\nover to one side and laying on the air tank. The air tank is getting\nred, too. I'm afraid ... it's weakening it.... Redder. Oh, oh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What?\" said Capt. Lawler.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Watch out! There.\n  <i>\n   There!\n  </i>\n  \" Capt. Wilkins leaped from his position.\nHe was still floating toward the ground when there was an incredibly\nbright flare from inside the dome, and a great, silent tongue of flame\nlashed through the airlock and rolled across the lunar surface.

The Soviets of Base Garagin are conducting a seismic test to learn more about the depths of the moon. The Americans protested it, as their base is not as strongly built, but the Russians went ahead anyway. With a language barrier and poor communication, the Americans don’t know when they are going to perform the test, so they stand outside in their suits waiting. After a few hours, a moonquake occurs, rippling through the surface. The quake caused a leak in their base, which Winship tries and fails to fix with a marker and a plastic sheet. He complains that the Russians did this on purpose, to try and force them off the moon, but they have three weeks of emergency air. They can try and fix it. \nThey are unable to use the transmission since there is no air in the base. Winship orders his men to find the caulking solution, but it has hardened and dried out. He orders Lawler and Chandler to make the 60-minute-round-trip journey to Base Garagin to ask for help. Though Soviet General Finogenov denies it, Winship still wonders if this was intentional. Wilkins and Winship share a meal of gross nutrition tablets. \nWilkins, the resident tech, hooks Winship up to the radio within his suit, so he can speak into the radio. With all the complicated wiring, Winship’s air supply is cut off, and he motions to Wilkins to fix it. Earth is on the line, but he tries to not make his problem known. After Wilkins fixes it, Winship informs them of their difficulties and is told that a replacement could arrive in 10 days and that the Russians formally apologized. \nChandler and Lawler arrive with a 55-gallon barrel of caulking agent, along with another compound that must be mixed in. Displeased by the Russian’s excessiveness, the team figures out a way to successfully mix it. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, while the rest move the barrel inside the dome with great difficulty. They mix the barrel and quickly realize that it is a chemical epoxy, one that reacts to temperature. The heat of the mixer and the dome causes the epoxy to heat up drastically. The men escape to the airlock and watch as the barrel explodes, the fire it causes using up all their remaining oxygen. \n"}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "2a5de3150ff94f21a84049f1efcb0fda", "response_text": "An American man named Major Winship learns that there will be an underground blast the following day.

Winship and his three crew members, Lawler, Wilkins, and Chandler, have no way of knowing when the explosion will be over because they are on the moon. Winship’s suit stops working, and his body starts to overheat. Although he knows it’s a risk, he decides to leave the safety of the dome so that he can cool down. He can’t stand the excessive heat and thinks that the explosion has already occurred.\n\nWhen Winship immerses himself in the moon’s environment, he successfully cools down. Within seconds, however, he feels the explosion. The men hear several minutes of static on their communication devices. They realize that their capsule has a dome and is losing pressure. Winship tries to cover the hole with a plastic sheet, but it doesn’t work. He reenters the dome and speaks to the Soviets on the phone. Their leader lets him know that they suffered zero damage and suggests that it’s because their dome is stronger and superior to the Americans’. Winship accuses them of purposefully failing to communicate, and the Soviet denies it. The men attempt to use some calk to fix the hole, but it is useless because it has already been exposed to air. \n\nAlthough the Americans hate to rely on the Soviets for any type of help, the crew has no choice at this point. Lawler and Chandler take the land car to the Soviet base to get supplies to patch the hole. Winship cannot travel because of his busted suit, and Wilkins stays behind with him.

The team uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, but the mixture gets incredibly hot and starts turning bright red.

Pinov is the Russian on the emergency line, but he does not speak English, so the Americans don't know when it will be safe to enter the dome again. It was hot outside the dome, and the suits' cooling systems could only do so much. Major Winship got tired of waiting and wanted to cool off, so he entered the dome, but as soon as he did so he was thrown off his feet from an explosion. Soon after, some static blocked communications for a minute or two, but then the men had a new problem: the dome was losing pressure, so they were losing air. After their best attempt at patching the hole, they got in touch with the Russians who had not sustained any damage. Major Winship had no patience for General Finogenov, even though the Russian was seemingly embarrassed that there had been a quake caused by his test, as he had promised therew ould not be. Lt. Chandler found the squeeze tubes that they could use to patch the rupture, but they were no longer any good, so Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler headed to Base Gagarin in their land car to ask to borrow calking compound from the Russians.  Major Winship and Capt. Wilkins figured they may as well report back to Earth, but once their communications connect, Major Winship realized he is on emergency air and tries to get help from Capt. Wilkins, but those on Earth heard Winship lose air and gasp. Wilkins caught on just in time, and updated those on Earth as they swaped out their oxygen supplies in their suits. Earth requested a report in three hours, confirming that the dome's leak hadn't been repaired, and Winship was relieved the Soviet didn't have to step in to help with his air issue. When the others returned with the fifty-five gallon drum of calking compound, they marveled at how much the Soviets had on hand, and then moved to make an electric mixer to prepare the compound. They tried to move the drum inside to mix it, but there wasn't room, and they tried to move it back out, so all of the men were sweating again. As they discussed how best to proceed in patching the dome, it occured to Wilkins that it could be a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, and just then they realized that the epoxy had become rock-solid and hot. Wilkins threw out orders to try to protect the men from the impending explosion, but he watched the drum of compound melt, and eventually the air tank started to heat up too.

According to the Russians, the test will help them determine the composition of the moon by analyzing the resultant seismic activity. However, Major Winship suspects the Russians, led by General Finogenov, are conducting the tests in order to purposefully sabotage American efforts to fortify their moon presence. They struggle to communicate with the Russian base as they await word on the status of their test, and when Major Winship goes back inside the dome to call them again, he is suddenly knocked over by movements of the moon's surface, signifying completion of the test. After the quakes settle, the crew discovers a leak in the protective dome, which causes air to slowly seep out. Luckily, they have an emergency air supply to last three weeks, but they lose a significant amount of calking that could be used to repair the leak. When a plastic sheet fails to patch the damage, Lt. Les Chandler searches for squeeze tubes that can ostensibly repair it. However, he discovers that the paste inside requires air in order to harden and some of the tubes have hardened already. Captain Skip Lawler accompanies Lt. Chandler to Base Gagarin in order to ask for calking that might help repair the patch. In their absence, Major Winship bemoans to Captain Larry Wilkins the luxury in which the Russians live on Base Gagarin compared to their discomfort in the cramped quarters of Freedom 19. He continues to muse about his theory that General Finogenov intentionally caused the explosion to harm their base and cause them to vacate the moon. As they await Lawler and Chandler's return, Capt. Wilkins calls Earth on the radio transmitter so that Winship can report the test explosion and the resulting damage. While he talks, he suddenly runs out of his emergency supply of air, and Wilkins refills it for him. Earth promises to restore their air supply in ten days. When Lawler and Chandler return with the calking compound, the crew spends a good amount of time engineering a large, mechanical mixer since the compound comes in a massive, heavy barrel and must be mixed together in order to use it properly. As Captain Wilkins begins mixing the compound, he suddenly realizes that it is a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin. The resin hardens, and the crew rushes out of the dome just before it melts, tips over the barrel, and ignites the air tank next to it, causing a massive explosion.

Such a quake could damage the American dome, meager in comparison with Base Gagarin. The Soviets put Pinov on the line, who only speaks Russian. Without the ability to communicate, the Americans were stuck outside on the moon for hours, waiting to see if the seismic eruption could be seen or felt. Feeling like idiots, one goes inside, just as an aftershock causes a leak in their dome. They instantly blame the Russians, especially since the Americans protested such a test. \nThis series of unfortunate events continues as the Americans quickly realize that their supplies are not able to fix the leak. They must ask the Russians for help, even after complaining to their home base about their actions. \nBase Gagarin is huge compared to the American dome. General Finogenov even has a wooden desk in his office, along with other earthly amenities that the Americans have been deprived of. The Russians have been on the moon for six years longer than the Americans, which could explain their extensive supplies. \nThey give the Americans a 55-gallon mixture to fix the leak, however, the language barrier prevents them from realizing what kind of epoxy it is. This miscommunication leads to the barrel exploding and further destroying the American dome. It’s fair to say that it’s not smooth sailing on the moon. \n"}, {"worker_id": "1", "uid": "2a5de3150ff94f21a84049f1efcb0fda", "response_text": "When Winship calls the Soviets to discuss the exact timing for the underground explosion, Pinov, the person who answers the call, cannot speak English. This makes Winship frustrated. When Captain Wilkins suggests to Captain Winship that he say the word “help” into the phone so that the Soviets will know it’s serious, Winship says he would rather die. This suggests that there’s a power dynamic between the two nations, and Winship, as an American, does not want to appear weak in front of the Soviets. Winship wants to keep his American crew safe, but his pride is equally important at this point. As a result of Winship’s refusal to say the word “help,” he ends up stepping outside of the dome before the explosion occurs. \n\nLater, Winship called General Finogenov, the Soviet leader, to report some damage to their dome. The General responds by explaining that the Soviets have a stronger dome, and Winship accuses Finogenov of deliberately cutting the ties of communication to keep the Americans guessing and jeopardize their safety. Finogenov profusely denies Winship’s claim and offers to help in any way possible. \n\nWinship is highly suspicious of the Soviets, and especially suspicious of Finogenov’s incredible working space in the dome. He has a wooden desk, a chair, and one hundred square feet to move around in. It appears to Winshp that Finogenov cares only about his own comfort and not about the safety of his American counterparts. When Winship has to call the Americans on Earth to let them know about the air leak, he is concerned that the Soviets are listening in on his call. He and his men do not want to wait 10 days for the other Americans to send them supplies to fix the leak, so their only real choice is to rely on the kindness of the Soviets. This makes Winship sick to his stomach, as he loathes asking them for help and potentially looking weak. \n\nIt appears that Winship’s suspicions are merited when the Soviets send over a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix a very small leak in the Americans’ dome, and they do not give the Americans proper instructions for how to prepare and use the chemicals. The crew uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, and the epoxy mixture turns bright red and blows up. \n"}, {"worker_id": "3", "uid": "3c517552d0524beea53ff661423a4360", "response_text": "There are seven Soviets and four Americans on the moon in this story, and there is definitely an issue of a balance of power.

On the day of the seismic test, the one Soviet who does not speak English is the one who is in charge of emergency communication, which Winship thinks was on purpose. The Soviets have a lot more electric power, and say that their experiments are all for purely scientific purposes, even if the Americans think the Soviets are trying to drive them out. The Americans have to rely on the Soviets for emergency supplies; they hope not to have to ask for air, but do retrieve a drum of calking compound to aid in the dome repairs which eventually causes an even larger problem as their air supply is burnt out.

The seven-person crew at Base Gagarin live in luxury compared to the American crew and have hot tea, better supplies, and more space to live and work. Major Winship expresses consistent frustration with the inability to communicate with Pinov during the atomic test, and he is deeply suspicious about General Finogenov's motives regarding the test in the first place. Winship does not trust when Finogenov insists the tests are being conducted for purely scientific purposes, and the results of the study will be made available in the technical press. For his part, Finogenov is deeply apologetic when the test causes a leak in Freedom 19 and therefore a drop in air pressure, but Winship still doesn't trust him. He believes it is all part of a Soviet plan to sabotage their mission and expel them from the moon. Winship's misgivings appear to have some truth (or else the whole incident reveals the incompetence of the American crew) when the Soviet base supplies the Americans a large batch of what they believe to be a calking compound in order to repair the air leak.

We took our places\nin the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that\nnobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling\nlost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to\nme. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An\nintelligent runt like me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said what I expected. \"Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get\ntogether when we get down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked\nhim. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crack\nhe'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, \"Not likely. I want to\ncome back alive.\" It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he went\nback to his place without saying anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't be\ntelling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect that\nscrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the\nmeantime, I've got brains as a consolation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.\nWe sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and\nthen we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have to\nleave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He's\nthe only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't go\npartners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that\ncrack about being a snob.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact\nthe Ship had had with it—and we were the ones who dropped them—was\nalmost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council\ndebate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was\nall right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to us\nkids because they never tell you anything about the place they're going\nto drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that much\nif Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody\nelse was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried when\nI said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that\nwasn't in public.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\nbecause I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me\nunhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\nPlanets make me feel wretched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\ncalves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on\na piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\nand little grubby things just looking for\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  to crawl on. If you\ncan think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty\nimagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells—I've\nbeen on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\nnot for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We have a place in the Ship like that—the Third Level—but it's only a\nthousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\na level or down a level and be back in civilization.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\nsea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\nhills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\ndon't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\ngear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\nsmarting from the slap I'd given him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\nJimmy—if he would get back alive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\nnearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\nlike fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow\nfor fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\ndo figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time\nyou're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\nthe Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\nis a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\nsomething has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\nfrom decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\nkeep the population steady.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\nfound at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\nVenie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\ngetting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\nlanding, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't\nhave anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the\nbad moment any longer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\nand in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\ncolor of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the\nlights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\nthe dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\nif it's really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in\nthirty gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\nthings in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\nThe first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\nI could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\ncamp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\nthough not with that meatball Jimmy D.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take\nnothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from\nnobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November—too close to\nYear End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\nspring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\nback we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\nlook forward to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\nanimals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\ngood, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\nbest meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I\nwondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\nthey've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good\nthat I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\nhillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\nit in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\nhard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\nof horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't\nidentify.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\nthey dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\nactual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\nEarth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\nestablished, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\ndraft animals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\nas well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\nelse in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\nwere planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that\n  <i>\n   could\n  </i>\n  have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\nhad to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll\nbet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  We'd come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the\nroad. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined\nbend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There\nwere five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures\nalive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and\nknobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for\nfaces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were\nalmost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They\nmade a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded\nalong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the\nmen on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as\ncats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line\nand he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That\none wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he\nhad a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we\nreached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow\nme. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the\nface he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man\nlooks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That\nwas why I kept riding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head?\nThere be escaped Losels in these woods.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it\nwas that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though.\nGenerally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say\nanything. It seemed smart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where be you from?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pointed to the road behind us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And where be you going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pointed ahead. No other way to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and\nDaddy, who should know better.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you'd\nbetter ride on from here with us. For protection.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a\nmouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether\neverybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International\nEnglish spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit\nwith him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they'd been\nwatching us all the while. He called to the hard man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at\nall. We mought as well throw him back again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he\nexpected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us\nto Forton for protection.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving\nalong and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes.\nI felt uncomfortable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"I don't think so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  What the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and\nreached for the rifle in his saddle boot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over\nwith the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he\ndidn't want to be fried.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let's go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I\ncould see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with\nnarrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling\ntones said, \"Look here, kid....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It\nsurprised me. I didn't think I sounded\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  mean. I decided he just\ndidn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the\ncreatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get\nthem now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next\nbend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and\nthe creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my\nmind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes\nI even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my\ngreat-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it,\nnestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than\nthe last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My face must have been like that as I rode along the road.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave\nway to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of\nthe green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before\nhadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or\nsomething.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody\nquestioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving\nsilently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've\nseen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received\na jolt that sickened me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were\ncold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to\na gallop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all\nstone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were\nno machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the\nedge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the\nwindow—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't\nsee one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There\nwere little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All\nthe boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why\nHorst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but\nI decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the\nclocks tick on this planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They\nswarmed. I saw a family come out of a house—a father and\n  <i>\n   four\n  </i>\n  children. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me\nthen—these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I\nclosed my eyes until it passed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The first thing you learn in school is that if it weren't for idiot and\ncriminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The\nevacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people\nwouldn't have died. There wouldn't have\n  <i>\n   been\n  </i>\n  eight billion people.\nBut, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in\ntheir path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth\nhad and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough\nforesight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some\nothers like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I\nwouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up\nblowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The\nolder people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the\nCouncil should know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt\n  <i>\n   really\n  </i>\n  frightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I\nfelt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I\nwhomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk\nagain. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's\nsmart and brains I needed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method.\nFor one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you\nwant to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody?\nWho? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind\nup with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think\nof was to find a library, but that might be a job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the\nlate afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was\nstarting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the\nsky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what\nhad gone wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal.\nThe scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to\ndrop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I\ntriggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't\nknow why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my\nhead, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started\nbucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain\nidiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me\noverhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours.\nNot too different, but not ours.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and\nwe wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that\ntakes an advanced technology to build.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to\na campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't\nhelp but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent\nbuildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more\nthan a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man,\nhis wife and their three children. The kids were running around and\nplaying, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father\ncame and pulled him away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said\nhello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I\nhad two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until\nthat moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these\nkids. Isn't that horrible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man\nI had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He\nhad white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never\nseen before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered\naround. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the\nchildren tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go,\nso the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd\naccent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness,\nit seemed just right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in\na house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a\nnice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony\nerrand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the\npoor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the\nhandkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her\ndear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to\ndefeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wished for the same for myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids\noff to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the\ncamp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I\ncouldn't see far into the dark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A voice there said, \"I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this\none, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're\nnot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the\ncampfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the\nfire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets\nand mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now\nwhat they used the high-walled pen for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the\nnight. I should have used my head. I hadn't and now it was time to take\nleave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I never got the chance.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I was just heaving the saddle up on Ninc when I felt a hand on my\nshoulder and I was swung around.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, well. Horst, look who we have here,\" he called. It was the one\nwho'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He\nwas alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he\nwent down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him\nand reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from\nbehind and pinned my arms to my side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly\nhand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a\nlungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I'm told—but he\ndidn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet\nand dragged me off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped\ndragging me and dropped me in a heap. \"Make any noise,\" he said, \"and\nI'll hurt you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'd\nthreatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things\nto do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight\nfor that. \"I ought to club you anyway,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting\nthe animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he said. \"Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what\nwe can use.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other one didn't move. \"Get going, Jack,\" Horst said in a menacing\ntone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally\nbacked down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me\nbeing kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his\nbunch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under\nmy jacket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Horst turned back to me and I said, \"You can't do this and get away\nwith it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of\ntrouble. So don't give me a hard time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I\ndidn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The courts won't let you get away with this,\" I said. I'd passed\na courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL\nJUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or\nsomething stuffy like that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I\nknew I'd goofed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Boy, boy. Don't talk about the courts. I be doing you a favor. I be\ntaking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go to\ncourt and they'll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leaving\nyou your freedom.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why would they be doing that?\" I asked. I slipped my hand under my\njacket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the\nShips,\" Horst said. \"That be enough. They already have one of you brats\nin jail in Forton.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, with\nall my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"The kid's got some good equipment. But I can't make out what\nthis be for.\" He held out my pickup signal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Horst looked at it, then handed it back. \"Throw it away,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I leveled my gun at them—Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, \"Hand\nthat over to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Horst made a disgusted sound.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't make any noise,\" I said, \"or you'll fry. Now hand it over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the\nsaddle. \"What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't remember,\" he said. \"But it be coming to me. Hold on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind\nand the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, \"Good\nenough,\" to the others who'd come up behind me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt like a fool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and\nsaid in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was\nnatural and mine wasn't, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it\nuntil it cracked and fell apart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard\nthat my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said calmly, \"You big louse.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I can\nremember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of my\nface and then nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Brains are no good if you don't use them.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "8ae98e9c174643e8a6c42be06fd58733", "response_text": "The story begins on a scoutship with 29 fourteen-year-olds.

His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under\nhis wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck\nwas flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only\nhis head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long\nthough narrower ribbons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good\nimitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was\nnot unexpected—non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient\nspeculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of\nhumans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many\nwidely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the\nages before space travel—\n  <i>\n   and yet each planetary race can interbreed\nwith a minimum of ten others\n  </i>\n  ! That's more than a legend—one hell of a\nlot more!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly\ndistasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my\nspecies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own\nworld, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and\nthat's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole\nexception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's\naccidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human\ndevelopment.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the\nbeginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on\nEmmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.\nAnd beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's\na corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to\nbreed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with\nMeredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may\nextend to Kelburn.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was\nproved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an\nunbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind\nof planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a\nhundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a\nfew of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was\nactually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists\nstretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the\nStone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude\nthat Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now\nfound. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout\nthis section of the Milky Way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across\nthousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"\ncommented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the\nresult of parallel evolution—not when a hundred human races are\ninvolved, and\n  <i>\n   only\n  </i>\n  the human race.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his\nribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories\nabout himself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous\nthough not always the most advanced—Ribboneers had a civilization as\nhigh as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were\nothers—and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got\ntogether—but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\nvery useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\nhelping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating\nprinciple?\" asked Sam Halden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\nthat humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\nWe've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary\nrace F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is\nfertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever\ntheir positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but\nwas a little further along. When we project back into time those star\nsystems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\npattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color\nchange was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he\nwas interested.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the\nstars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion\nof it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're\nlooking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is\ntoday and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,\nfor purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.\nThere was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky\nWay is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain\ntogether, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we\ncalculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped\nthe motion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly\nequal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't\nclose, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are\nhumans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate\nwith those they were adjacent to\n  <i>\n   two hundred thousand years ago\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"\nmurmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that\nsatisfies the calculations?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something\nthat might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a\nrepresentative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have\nother ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other\nmammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.\nThe evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the\ntime right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two\nends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic\nlight-years—then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a\nfast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our\nexploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it\nthis trip.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the\nvisionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\n\"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd\nbetter ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn\nwas the most advanced human type present, but while there were\ndifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't\nas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in\nthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\nlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\nthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and\nthis was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some\nrespect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of\nyour pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give\nhim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four\nmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\nus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\nhave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\nwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to\nhave an expert—and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\nability.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\nplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency\nsuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\nthe incentives?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the\nRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\ncent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the\nprofits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n\"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\nyou'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound\nroll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take\nyou all day—it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that\nI'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly\neverywhere in this sector—places men have never been.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the\nintegrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it\nfor me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his\nribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the\nregion toward which we're heading.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Firmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and\nan equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his\neyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the\nmating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had\nbeen inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of\nhis place in the human hierarchy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,\nwouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how\nlong and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given\nmuch thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy\nto see why.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the\nbiologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more\nabout these things than I do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed\nto smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still\ncomplains.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Halden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes\nthrough a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his\nevolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense\nless complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher\nhumans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't\nprepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's\nreaction was quite typical.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said\nHalden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do\nsomething about it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  can do.\" Halden paused\nthoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as\nfast as they grow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays.\nUse them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now\nthey won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The\nanimals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that\nway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship\nwas a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.\n\"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of\nplaces to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with\nnew equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can\ndo except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place\njust to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices\neverywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down\nbecause there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of\nweapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were\ntrying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and\nleaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of\nprivileges.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halden started. So she\n  <i>\n   knew\n  </i>\n  that the crew was calling her that!\nPerhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't\nsaid it. It didn't help the situation at all.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Taphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,\nhe wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs\nwere folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on\nthe seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never\nquite still.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech\ntells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Neither do we.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small\nfour-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A\ntypical pest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.\n\"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half\na dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had\naccess to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard\nradiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are\npossibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's\ndeveloped a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things\nit detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's\nsmarter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be\nso hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's\nstrong enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it\nover while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about\nhumans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical\nancestor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Emmer didn't look like the genius he was—a Neanderthal genius, but\nnonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a\nstubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy\nhands through shaggier hair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world\nwith the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of\ntheir camp.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all\nhumans—late or early and male or female—look remarkably alike. If you\nare an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his\nspeech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?\nImpressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and\nwe'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world\nwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\nit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\nstructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\nforty feet high.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years—and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\nplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\nTaphetta.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\nor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\natomic—because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\nfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\naggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\naloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\nwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this\ndiscovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing\nwhere we came from.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment\nwas required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational\ninstitutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual\ncuriosity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?\nWhen a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than\nphysiology is changed—the pattern of life itself is altered. Things\nthat were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in\ncultural discoveries.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced\ncivilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've\nachieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.\n\"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,\nbut wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,\nworking directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and\nproduced us. They\n  <i>\n   were\n  </i>\n  master biologists.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your\nfantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built\nup a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling\nfractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk\nusing bait for your pest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's\nconsent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been\nbothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer\ncontract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as\nmuch as you think you will. The difference is this:\n  <i>\n   My\n  </i>\n  terms don't\npermit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding\nanything. Halden examined his own attitudes.\n  <i>\n   He\n  </i>\n  hadn't intended, but\ncould he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?\nHe couldn't, and it was too late now—whatever knowledge they acquired\nwould have to be shared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was what Taphetta had been afraid of—there was one kind of\ntechnical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could\nimprove itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start\nthat could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing\nup. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound\nanimals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with\nit, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the\ntwo crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a\nminiature keyboard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ready?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at\na minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them\nexactly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape\ncrept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming\nforward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open\nfloor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the\nside of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began\nnibbling what it could reach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another\nshape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one\nretreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped\nand the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up\nand mauled the other unmercifully.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it\nbacked off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.\nThen it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within\nreach, it climbed into the branches.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging\nitself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no\nnoise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying\naway, still within range of the screen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top\nand there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed\naround and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as\nit snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent\ndefeat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and\nlanded on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal\nheard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping\nthe last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The small one stood still till the last instant—and then a paw\nflickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of\nthe charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.\nThe knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped\nmoving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its\nfoe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been\nfound—\n  <i>\n   and laid it down\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too\nbright for anything to be visible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out\nthat the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their\nmachines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets\nexactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't\nhave to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,\nthey'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a\ncreature without real hands?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try—and\nthey'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I\nlike the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of\nmarrying you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew\nthat, in relation to her, he was\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  advanced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by\nleaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To\nher, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They went to his cabin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\nwasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\nlong and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\nexcept for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\nthe difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\ndevelopment, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\nthe violet end of the spectrum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\nprimeval Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\nher own world. She had something else in mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\nhave subhuman monsters.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It would be a step up—for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\nIt had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\nsurface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\nthem start lower than I am?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\nit governed personal relations between races that were united against\nnon-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\npermanent union.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it\nlead me astray.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific\nabout it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't\nlike him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.\nThere's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race\nhad a body like hers and she knew it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and\nI would be infertile.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act\nunconcerned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique\nsmile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction\nwas purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh\ngive when his knuckles struck it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took\nit away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front\nof it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the\nblood and pain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She\nclosed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back\nand looked at herself critically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it\nhealed by morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across\nthe bridge. Then she came over to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,\ninvisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still\nfeel that attraction to her?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and\nhe's even more savage than I am.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too\nmuch, though. You're just right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what\nEmmer would do—and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of\nthe physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage—what\nadvantage?—for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,\nnothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the\nhigher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he\nwanted her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry\nyou in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children\nI have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not\ncompletely her fault. Besides....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior\nchildren—and they might be his.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were\nthey all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime\ntoward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over—no,\n  <i>\n   through\n  </i>\n  —everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry—onward and\nupward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger\nwas turned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already\nbroken it once.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "103", "uid": "8f4bf470977a4c4abc9410bd38d43dfb", "response_text": "The story starts with four of the species of the spectrum of human development together, talking and explaining about the possibility of mating with different species on the spectrum to Taphetta the Ribboneer.

The crew of Halden’s expedition, humans from the various human-inhabited worlds, represents the range of human development: Emmer is a Neanderthal-type archeologist who represents early humanity, Halden is an early-middle human, Meredith is a linguist from an advanced-middle human society, and Kelburn is a mathematician from the far advanced side of human evolution. \nTaphetta, himself from an advanced civilization, is initially uninterested in Halden’s theories of human evolution. However, as Kelburn elaborates on the adjacency mating principle, an observation supporting the humans’ hypothesis of a common ancestor which distributed humans throughout the galaxy, he becomes interested. Taphetta accepts the humans’ invitation to be their pilot for the expedition, on the condition that they use his contract. \n\tAn engineer from the ship’s hydroponics department, which is responsible for regulation of the ship’s air, reports to Meredith, who is physically attractive and wearing a revealing skirt, that Taphetta is not fond of the air. Halden learns that the air quality in the ship has been suffering due to damage to the plants caused by an animal. Despite the engineer’s efforts, the animal is resistant to pesticides and is intelligent enough to avoid the electric traps. They resolve to bait it into a trap. \n\tHalden approaches the ribboneer to inform him of the infestation. As he considers using the bait, Taphetta asks Emmer about the archeological evidence of their common ancestor on his home planet. The Neanderthal reveals that relics of massive proportions indicate the size of the common ancestor, and that they were likely long-lived and able to travel faster than light. Halden hypothesizes that their ancestor was unable to find a suitable planet, so instead left modified versions of themselves on each planet they visited. Taphetta is further interested by the theory of the common ancestry and finally acquiesces to using a bait to trap the pest. He also reveals that the terms of the contract upon which he insisted prohibits that information discovered during the expedition be withheld to the benefit of any race. \n\tMeredith and Halden are now monitoring the hydroponics room. They control two pest-like puppets which enact a fight scene: the smaller puppet, initially defeated by the larger, finds a knife and is able to slay the larger. The humans hope that the pests will be lured to the knife. Meredith and Halden then retire to his cabin, where she discusses the possible father of her children. Though she loves him, she dismisses the idea of bearing his child, as it will dilute her evolved biology. He strikes her and breaks her nose, but she quickly heals.

Curious, and slightly skeptical, of the mission, Taphetta interrogates Sam Halden, a biologist, and Kelburn, a mathematician, about their theory of how humans evolved. Through analyzing the galactic routes of the human race and their locations throughout history, the team believes they have pinned the general home of the big ancestor. Taphetta agrees to help in the mission, under the condition that the team agrees to his own proposed contract rather than their own. As Taphetta prepares for navigation, he notes to Firmon, head of hydroponics, that he is bothered by the air quality on the ship. Firmon attempts to improve the air, however is met with an issue; the plants on the ship are being eaten by an unknown animal that hides within its machinery. With options limited to rebuilding the ship or baiting the animals through a risky experiment, Taphetta is again skeptical of the conditions of the ship. He requests that the team answer more questions while he thinks it over, and inquires about the big ancestor and its qualities. Emmer, a Neanderthal archaeologist, recounts his experiences growing up around the ruins of the ancestors; the infrastructure was all that they left behind, with no other scrap of information that would indicate their existence, though it is likely that they left in search of another planet to live on while improving themselves through the alteration of their germ plasm. Taphetta then questions the motives of the mission, to which Emmer and Halden consider the abilities of the big ancestor, and how much of an achievement it would be to gain the knowledge they possessed biologically. Holden asks Taphetta what the difference was between the contract the team proposed and his own; he responds and says that his contract ensured the discoveries made on this mission would not be withheld for humans exclusively. With Taphetta agreeing to baiting the animals, the team uses a realistic puppet that resembles the pests, with a retractable knife that is able to kill them when they get close. After a successful test run, Halden and linguist Meredith, who have an intimate relationship to each other, go back to Halden's cabin, where they discuss the future, including having children. Meredith, who is of a higher race than Halden, admits that her main concern is bearing children that are as superior as possible, which requires a partner of a higher race than her.

It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they\ncame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed\nthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born\nin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low\nvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might\nlie at the long journey's end. For the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  was coming home; the\nsun ahead was\n  <i>\n   the\n  </i>\n  Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud, the\n  <i>\n   Quest III's\n  </i>\n  captain, came slowly down the narrow\nstair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\nrecreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it—no more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby—\n  <i>\n   there\n  </i>\n  —and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed—but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now—for Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\nhesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n  <i>\n   Quests\n  </i>\n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible—not likely, though—that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the\n  <i>\n   Quest III's\n  </i>\n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were\nstill interested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n  <i>\n   Quest\n  </i>\n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight—so we launched the\n  <i>\n   Quests\n  </i>\n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That\nwas from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first\ndisappointments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four\nyears old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange\nlonging....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on\nthe screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing\nthrough fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"According to plan, the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  has reached its furthest point from\nEarth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more\nstars and stellar systems—but hope is small that any of those will\nprove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined\nalready.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have\nonly, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the\nUniverse, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead\nalong the Milky Way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the\nglobular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars\nthere in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's\nneighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But\nOmega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Even so—by expending its remaining fuel freely, the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  could\nachieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility\nof aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey—even if enough\nfuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after\nmore than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and\nperhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other\n  <i>\n   Quests\n  </i>\n  , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according\nto the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization—if the\nother expeditions failed also—will have reached a dangerously unstable\nphase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from\noverpopulation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about\nEarth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a\ndecree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be\nforgotten back there?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know—some of them still show signs\nof homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that\nwas once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then\nhe sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake\nhim. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them\nonce in translation from the ancient English....\n </p>\n <i>\n  ... for my purpose holds\n </i>\n <i>\n  To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n </i>\n <i>\n  Of all the western stars, until I die.\n </i>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became\nunhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea\nwhat it had been—a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of\nthe Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars\nsuch collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have\nbeen done. The\n  <i>\n   Quest III's\n  </i>\n  collision armor was nonmaterial and for\npractical purposes invulnerable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the\nintercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,\nfrowning—surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,\nmaybe—it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook\nthe vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded\ncat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain,\nwe're being attacked!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically,\nthen felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all\nthese years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.\nThere was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start—three\nshort buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the\ninterstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,\n\"Now—attacked by what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a\nsixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the\n  <i>\n   Quest III's\n  </i>\n  framework. The\nnavigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not\nfifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to\nshow them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them\nlong enough to tell much.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry\nanything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were\nbig; he had heard his father's words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old\nseriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you,\nhuh, Dad?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\"\nHe headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.\nTheir faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions\nof horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty\nengines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,\nmost of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof\nLlud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and\nthey're all banging away at us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen\nwhere occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice\nfrom the same position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.\nHis young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in\nhis father.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have\nunlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they\ncan't touch us as long as our power lasts—or until they bring up some\nbigger stuff.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The mild shocks went on—whether from projectiles or energy-charges,\nwould be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting\nthe\n  <i>\n   Quest III's\n  </i>\n  shell was doing it at velocities where the\ndistinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive\nfield which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of\nthe ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly\ntransmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and\nall space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A\nmeteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded—usually vaporized by\nthe impact—and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite\nforces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its\ndeflection was negligible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The people in the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  would have felt nothing at all of\nthe vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their\ninertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,\nwas intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to\nprovide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in\nwait for us. But why on Earth—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why—on\nEarth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if\none were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or\nchange course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left\nif there had been; come what might, this was journey's end—perhaps\nin a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around\nwheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,\nalways attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The\ninterstellar ship bore no offensive weapons—but suddenly on one of the\nvision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling\nthe watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn\napart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was\npaying attention to him. The men on the\n  <i>\n   Quest III's\n  </i>\n  bridge looked\nquestions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed\ninto many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have\ncaught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored\ntoo direct a hit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been\ngot, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  ,\nexcept that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their\nsize was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance\nand speed—but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by\nthe Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching\nships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than\nGwar Den had at first supposed—not large enough to hold even one man.\nTiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine\nas it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human\norigin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy\nthey had explored, but one of the other\n  <i>\n   Quests\n  </i>\n  might have encountered\nand been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to\nconquer.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a\nconstant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into\nspace, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That\nargued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind\nit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate\nwe're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight\nhours.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not\nknowing why we're being attacked.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a\nthought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological\nadvantage, too!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have\nnoticed it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he\nhadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts\nswinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've\ngot something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in\na position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I\nwas going to say—I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At\nleast we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an\naudio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,\nrepeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that\nthey were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and\nquerying again, \"Who are\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under\nmultiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater\namounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but\nconverting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own\nnerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of\nhis ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time,\nCaptain—I've got some data on Earth now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But\nthey told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and\nthose were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up\ninquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.\n\"First of all—there are no lights on the night side. And on the\ndaylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces\nof cities, canals, and the like—but it does not.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal\ngreen vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates\nreflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the\nvegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine\nmoss or even a coarse mold.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well—we tried\nphotography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing\nand likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is\nopaque to it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps\nyou can answer some of these riddles before—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   We know who you are\n  </i>\n  ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a\nstrange accent, \"\n  <i>\n   and pleading will do you no good.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from\nhim once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended\nabsurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating\ntape.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling\nwith space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the\nlast. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already\nreturned and been destroyed, as you will soon be—the sooner, if you\ncontinue toward Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice—which must be coming\nfrom Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships—was not very smart; it\nhad already involuntarily told him a couple of things—that it was not\nas sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned\nto speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the\n  <i>\n   Quest\nIII's\n  </i>\n  ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow\nfrightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know\nsomething, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \"\n  <i>\n   Are you\nhuman?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are\nnot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.\nBehind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned\nhush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully\ninto its field.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud\nwoodenly. He named a vision frequency.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its\nlanguage that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the\nchanges that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize\nyour position, you will follow the intelligent example of the\n  <i>\n   Quest\nI's\n  </i>\n  commander.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud stiffened. The\n  <i>\n   Quest I\n  </i>\n  , launched toward Arcturus and the\nstar cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the\n  <i>\n   Quest III\n  </i>\n  the\nmost hopeful of the expeditions—and its captain had been a good friend\nof Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to\nhim?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some\ntime,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he\npreferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short\npause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a\npicture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,\nbut undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed\nthe same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the\n  <i>\n   Quest\nIII\n  </i>\n  , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head\nseemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question.\nWhy do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great\neyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a\npoisonous hatred.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "072b266a911a4f7e8c3768c11a49f65d", "response_text": "A spaceship named Quest III is moving towards a color-changing star, but this time it is the Sun.

She worries that they won’t fit in, and everything they once were familiar with are different now. During this few hours before they reach Earth, the captain goes to his private office-cabin and started to view records of their trip. He first views one among the earliest. In the record, he was energetic and, despite a blank visit to Procyon, there was idealism. Then the captain selected a later one where they still have not find any planets. They are starting to believe that the Sun’s world is a rare accident. Finally he takes a record that is only four years old, when they’ve reached the furthest point from Earth, according to the plan.

They start to broadcast questions asking the attacker to identify themselves. Finally, the images of Earth arrive, and to their surprise, it seems as if mold has covered all the cities.

He listens through recordings of himself when he was much younger and relives the feelings it felt at the time. He thinks about how he had the option to pursue an expedition of the globular cluster of Omega Centauri but instead chose to return to Earth. He cannot think of why he really chose to return to Earth besides the longing and familiarity it had. \n\nDuring the captain’s time of reflection, there is a sudden jolt on the ship. The captain because confused about the potential trouble. He is informed by Den that the ship is being attacked. He orders the alarms to be sound in response. Den details that there are multiple tiny crafts attacking their ship. The attacks were not damaging the ship, but they were dangerous because they were depleting the already very limited fuel supply. \n\nEventually, the attackers make contact with the Quest III. The captain talks to the person and believes that they are trying to frighten them because they are frightened themselves. He is able to confirm that the person he is speaking to is human, but is unable to discern why he seems so strange.

He\nknocked over the pitcher of\n  <i>\n   thil\n  </i>\n  , but it didn't matter. The pitcher\nwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\nvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\nspring them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\ndown the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\na curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\nI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\nSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a\nlot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\nI've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\neleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!\nNothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\nBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face\nunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\ngrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\ngirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\nslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\ntoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\nShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\nShannon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\npleasantly and said, very gently:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if\nhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\nsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\nin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\ngrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\nclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\nwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\nblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"I don't think you understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\nback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\ngot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\nand let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\nIt knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\nquivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you,\nJig? I'm not going to hurt him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm\nShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\nthe table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\nstayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\nthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\never met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more\nthan you could see through sheet metal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,\n\"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\nlike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\nBeamish. I wish to—ah—charter your circus.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't\nsay anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\npitcher of\n  <i>\n   thil\n  </i>\n  on the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\nindependent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\nthe burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\nstarted to get up. I kicked him under the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\nignored him. He went on, quietly,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\nvaluable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\ntoil and boredom....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no\nentertainment of the—\n  <i>\n   proper\n  </i>\n  sort has been available. I propose to\nremedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\na tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\nspeak, and I kicked him again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel\nseveral engagements....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\nglared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Gow, our zoo-man—a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\ncolony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\nscenery—scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\ncurtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\nthan the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude\nain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to\nfit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome,\nsee? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot\nship'll hold her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\ncleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gertrude?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\nfinished for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\nVenusian\n  <i>\n   cansin\n  </i>\n  . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\nBrothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be\na little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\nwouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking\ncircus than even I could stand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beamish looked impressed. \"A\n  <i>\n   cansin\n  </i>\n  . Well, well! The mystery\nsurrounding the origin and species of the\n  <i>\n   cansin\n  </i>\n  is a fascinating\nsubject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have\nat least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\nBeamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\nsecond I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\nstomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\nagreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\noff half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\nthe morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\ngrab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\nHere.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We\ncan get lushed enough on this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\nhe said suddenly,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It may be crooked.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I\nyelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\nwhere the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\npoked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\n  <i>\n   thildatum\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where\nShannon's Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late\nas it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting\naround and smoking and looking very ugly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless\nunder the two moons. There's a smell to Mars, like something dead and\ndried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown\nred dust gritted in my teeth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to\nthe roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his\nfeet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I\ngrinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more\nthan money. It grates on a man's pride to have to sneak in and out of\nhis own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in\nweeks we'd come in at the front door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly,\nBucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts.\nBucky yawned and stretched sleepily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now?\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join\nin. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went\nhome happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the\ngreen girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the\nmuscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers\nand joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the\npassageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.\n\"They're good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I've\nrewarded them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go see Gertrude.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going\ninto the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I'm a city\nguy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But\nBucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're a pal, Jif. Bes' li'l' guy inna worl'....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he'd fall down\nthe ladder and break his neck. That's why I went along. If I hadn't....\nOh, well, what's a few nightmares among friends?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was\na dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude's hand. We started down\nthe long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and\ncompression units.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn't\nnear as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It's\nthe smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them,\nbreathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled\naround them as strong as the cage bars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and\nthen wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again.\nA high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell,\nripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same\ntime. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I\ncould think of, and I couldn't hear myself doing it. Presently a great\nmetallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow\nhad them nicely conditioned to that gong.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel\nthem inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared of\nthem. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought—like I wanted\nto put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night,\nall of a sudden....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She's gettin'\nworse,\" he said. \"She's lonesome.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an\nowl's. He swayed slightly. \"That's sure tough.\" He sniffled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank\nand even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a\ndeep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a\n  <i>\n   cansin\n  </i>\n  . There's only\ntwo of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say will\nmake much difference.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They're what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old\nDame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The\n  <i>\n   cansins\n  </i>\n  were pretty\nsuccessful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and\nnow there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even\nthe Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck\nsome place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little\nbird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage\nwith her hands—yeah, hands—hanging over her knees and her snaky head\nsunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.\nHer eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the\nmane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes\nclear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like\nold Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow!\nNobody's ever seen a male\n  <i>\n   cansin\n  </i>\n  . There may not even be any.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head.\nThe sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That\nclose, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold\ninside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You'll have to snap her out of\nthis, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood\nlooking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he\nturned to Gertrude.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak's wreck\nand everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know\nher. I can do things with her. But this time....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a\nwoman's talking about a sick child.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain't sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need\nher.\" I took Shannon's arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look at\nus. Bucky sobbed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But\nit's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there with\nGertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed\nhigh and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all\naround us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist\nrose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly\nwith blue, cold fire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow—for God's sake!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp\nand heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and\nroars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all\nI could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought, \"\n  <i>\n   Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wants\nto kill us!\n  </i>\n  \" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I\nsobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I\nrolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the\nhollow of his shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the\nback of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my\nmouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,\n\"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I went out.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. His\nlittle brown face was crinkled with laughter. He'd lost most of his\nteeth, and he gummed\n  <i>\n   thak\n  </i>\n  -weed. It smelt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You pretty, Mis' Jig,\" he giggled. \"You funny like hell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him and\nsaid, \"Where's Shannon? How is he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mis' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis' Jig. Mis' Gow come\nnickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down\na couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the\nwashstand—I was in my own cell—and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned\nsnakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch\nplaid. I felt sick.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was\na big burn across his neck. He said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in.\nSomebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far.\nNobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One hundred U.C.'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge\nmining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shrugged. \"You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off the\ncreditors.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn't a\ncomfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign.\" He put his hand on the\nlatch and looked at my feet. \"And—uh—Jig, I....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,\nand Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking\nlike a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian\nstrong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had\nkittens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. It\nlived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out\nof their pants. Circus people are funny that way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.\nAnybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. It\ndidn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at\ndinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I\nwas ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our\nitinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It\nwas Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a\nbunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle\nof it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and\nour router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and\nwent out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they\nweren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus\nheat was already sneaking into the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,\nscreaming.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in\nthe mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I\nstood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was\nstanding in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her\ntriangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn't have anything on\nbut her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn't\nsound nice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with\nthe electric power they carry in their own bodies. They're Venusian\nmiddle-swampers, they're not human, and they never forget it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with\nwhite reptilian teeth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can\nsmell it in the swamp wind.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under\nher jaw pulsed like a toad's, and her eyes were red.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken.\nThey are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight\nand cold. Bucky said,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's eat if they have a bar in this dump.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We weren't half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing\nfield when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We\ncould see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or\nfour tries to get our names out clear enough to understand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky said, \"Jig—it's Sam Kapper.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled\naround to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man\nwho crawled and whimpered in the mud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and\ncarnivals. He'd given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren't\ntoo broke, and we were pretty friendly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hadn't seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed,\nhard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick,\nlooking down at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over\nlike animals I've seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over\nand put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn't pay much attention. I\nonly caught a glimpse of the man's face as he straightened up. I didn't\nrealize until later that he looked familiar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a\ncouple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled\nthe curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the\ncigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky said gently, \"Okay, Sam. Relax. What's the trouble?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines\nof his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\nwith mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it\nand brought it out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\nme,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\ngot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you—where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Cansin\n  </i>\n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay—a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n  <i>\n   Lhak\n  </i>\n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Selak\n  </i>\n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "2c5add235d404c4f81bac16a7fd14cc0", "response_text": "Bucky Shannon, a space circus owner, and his business manager, Jig Bentley, have a dispute over the business' financial hardships.

After having some fun all together, the two go to see Gertrude, a huge cansin, the main attraction, who was earlier reported to be unhappy.

The sorrow of this creature makes the whole team sad and uneasy, full of pity, and no one could help, even Gow who saved her and is the closest to her. Exiting her tank, Jig has to carry Bucky, who is crying at the view and falling asleep at the same time. On their way, the two face the Vapor snakes let out by someone, they fall, and the snakes cover their bodies. Gow saves the two and they are burnt but alive, trying to find out who let the snakes out to hurt them and suspecting Beamish. Then the whole gang goes to Venus to meet Beamish, and there is a feeling of discontent coming from the gang and mixed with Gertrude's screams all the way. Further, the Nahali woman from the gang claims to smell death and trouble. Then they meet Sam, a hunter selling them animals until three seasons ago, and now he is crying and scared. Turns out, he has found the only male cansin and wants to take it back to prevent trouble, though he is afraid of people wanting to take the cansin from him.

They return to the spaceport where Bucky’s Imperial Circus is lounging around, there are about twenty of them sitting there. While in the spaceport, Bucky expresses that he wants to go see Gertrude. Jig does not. They go down a dark hallway in search of Gertrude. Jig smells a sour and wild scent emanating in the area. They hear loud screaming and can sense that Gertrude is suffering because she cannot find someone to mate. Jig emphatically tells Gow that it is impossible because a male cansin has never been seen nor proven to exist. \n\nSoon chaos is let loose. Vapor snakes are somehow let out and Jig and Bucky attempt to run away. Bucky causes Jig to stumble and the snakes are able to get to them, burning them through their clothes. They pass out and wake up in a cell with injuries. Bucky says that someone had to have let the snakes out. He wants to know why someone wanted to kill them. They are unable to figure out who did it. Someone named Sam comes up to them and then they start running towards him because they realize they recognize him. They get Sam into a shack and ask him what happened. Sam is desperately trying to communicate that he found a male cansin and wants them to take it back. He then appears to pass out and they find Beamish standing behind a curtain. Jig notices that there is something unusual about the audience at the bar and tries to explain the situation. \n"}, {"worker_id": "101", "uid": "876d8e6c28a04c49b25e1d72413c4be0", "response_text": "Bucky Shannon and Jig are the heads of Shannon's Imperial Circus, a circus that tours around space. They are sitting in a bar, defeated due to the lack of success in their circus. Bucky and Jig are out of money with their circus in pathetic condition. They are then interrupted by a small man who asks for Bucky, holding a large amount of money. Bucky introduces himself and Jig, and the man introduces himself as Beamish. Beamish has taken an interest in Shannon's Imperial Circus and offers to charter it, proposing that the circus make a tour on the settlements along the Tehara Belt, on Venus. Jig, not wanting to seem too desperate or reveal the state of the circus to Beamish, is hesitant at first, saying they would have to cancel on events. The three are interrupted by Gow, the circus' zoo-keeper, who informs Bucky that Gertrude, a Venusian cansin that is the star of the circus, is not doing well. Beamish is impressed at the presence of a cansin, given there is only one other animal of the species. Jig names a price of one hundred U.C's for Beamish to join the partnership. Though a large amount of money, Jig advises that it is reserved for the men they owe it to. Bucky and Jig return to the circus spaceport, where they meet a group of men and give them money, then proceed to beat the group of men up. Once inside, Bucky convinces Jig to see Gertrude with him, and once they see her, they notice that she is in terrible condition. Gow informs them that Gertrude wants a mate, which is practically impossible because there are only two known cansins. Jig tells Gow to do what he can to help Gertrude, as him and Bucky head to bed. Once they start to rest, they wake in a panic as the Vapor snakes attack them, having escaped in the night. Jig awakes, injured, and Bucky concludes that they have been sabotaged by whoever let the snakes out. They suspect Beamish as the culprit, but sign his contract anyway out of a need for money. They then go on their trip to Venus, stopping at Nahru and meeting with Beamish and the gang. On their way to a bar, they come across Sam Kapper, a hunter who supplies animals to attractions. Kapper is in visible pain. They take him into the bar, asking him what had happened. Kapper eventually tells them that he has found a male cansin, but before he can say where, he dies.

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\ntypical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\nAcademician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\nwho still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\nhaving his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\neyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\nGirard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\nGubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\ncourage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\nthe Ultrawelfare State.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\nLofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\nbright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\nthe cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\nmiserably failed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\nIn his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\nPond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\nbeen trained. There aren't two men on North America—there aren't two\nmen in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\ndelving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\nus would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\nroad to his destiny.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\ntraining forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers\nthroughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\nforesee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\nlack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\nadventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\nancestors did?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\nand tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\npresent generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's\nway of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with\nthe unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous\npastimes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap\nrebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\nreality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more\nthan is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\nUltrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\nsecurity by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\nsociety that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\nclothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\nof subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\ninto industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\npopulation is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\ndossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\nyou yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\nthe more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\ntrips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\nlife than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\nvery few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\nHe was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\nof drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\nmade his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\ndrafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\nfree from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\nour pleas for a few more trips?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\nseemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\nthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\nman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\nalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\nactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\nthe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one\nneed face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the\nfact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's\nleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the\npoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\ntake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\npilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\nexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\nincreasingly hard to come by—even though in\n  <i>\n   our\n  </i>\n  minds, Hans, we are\nnear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\nspark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\nhold of us.

Haven't you ever read\nof the sailor and his way of life?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\ndo with it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\nthan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\ntendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\nheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\nbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\nsea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\nfor years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\nof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\none short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\nheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\nwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\njail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\ncan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd\npersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\nthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\nuniversal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\n\"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\nnobody can, ah,\n  <i>\n   con\n  </i>\n  you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\nour present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\nmethods, my dear chap.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\nexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\nof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't\nbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his\nname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\nwere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\nthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\nfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\ntaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\nthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\nhad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\ntake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\na bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\ndangers met and passed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\nhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor\nneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't\nany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the\nreputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\nfellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\nnot. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did\nyou need?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\nin adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\nThey had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\nworking hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\nIt finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\nbut two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\nbecame obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\nthirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\nto have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\nof them ever really becoming efficient.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\nunemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\nunemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\nreasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\nand a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\nwere needed, a draft lottery was held.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\nwere drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\nmight feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\ngranted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\nthey fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\ndividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\nsold for a lump sum on the market.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\nvacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\nof his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\nobviously called for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd\naccumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\nto blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\nwas burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\nwasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\nfell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\nrate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the\nclassiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\nall the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\ncenturies since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\nthe tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's\nprofits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\nquite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\nmust leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\nusually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\nhurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\ndenied him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si was going to do it differently this time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\nworks. But nothing but the best.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\nretirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\nattached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\nA bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In\nthe Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\nperformed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't\nneeded. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\ntitles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\ncard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\nauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\nscreen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\nInalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\nthousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\napiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\nscreen went dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\nspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\nwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\nwouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\nwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\ntwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\nthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\nplace really made sense. The big city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\nand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\nmight as well do it up brown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\ncar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\ncontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\ndestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on\nthe hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\nhe'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\ngossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\nshot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\nrefrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\ndirection of the pressure was reversed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\nsub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\ncanopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\nyour credit card within ten minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\nswank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\nthe guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\nthe full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\nEmpire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\nthe all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\ntable, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\nhe well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine\nor do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\nmanaged to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\nhimself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness\nhe presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\ndirection so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\nmattress.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\nfell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\nagainst the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\nregistration could be completed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\neasy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\naround in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\nThis time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\nthe grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\nat the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\ndime a dozen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\n\"Kudos Room.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\nmoment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.\nHowever, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\ngoing to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\nhis way to the bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was actually a bartender.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\nair of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\nthey had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\nHe put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\ndrink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\nas to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd\ndreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\nconning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\nto his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\ntake a look at the others present.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\nthat he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\nUltrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\nwho occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\nand then swallowed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Zo-ro-as-ter\n  </i>\n  ,\" he breathed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\nhaving cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\neyes. Every pore, but\n  <i>\n   every\n  </i>\n  pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\ngrace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His stare couldn't be ignored.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\nOut Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\nKudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\nbuilding the drink.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\non me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\nOriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a\nspace pin?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you\nbeen on at least a Moon run.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\n\"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\nyou.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\nSi,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\nSeymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything\nlike this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\ncurrent sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\n\"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to\nif they say Seymour.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\nsuch that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having\nmet him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\nbored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\nhim in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Academician\n  </i>\n  Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\n  <i>\n   Doc\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have\nmuch time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\nthat. But how come you cried?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\nas though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\nDoctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\nyour space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\nplanets....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And\nthe dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\nthat you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\nworld trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to\ntake on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be\ndropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\nBoard. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\nit'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\nSo old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to\npressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\nDepartment, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\nships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\nspaceships costs?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\nthe hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\nknow so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested\nin space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\nThink it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\nmaterials and all and keep the economy going.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've\nread all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\nand everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd\nsay I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was\nnever much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\nafter my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\never talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\nkeeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\narticles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration\nalready. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed\ntight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's\nprecious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man\naboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole\nflock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard,\nbut....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic\nand he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n \n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "106", "uid": "a2c1299a0e864fc0b9c84425c3f49aa6", "response_text": "Seymour Pond has just retired from his career as the last astronaut from the Ultrawelfare State at the age of thirty. At his going away party he is given a watch, and academics like Lifting Gubelin and Dr Hans Girarad-Perregaux speak on his behalf. Si has decided to take the money he has saved up from his time working, which most people in the Ultrawelfare state don't, and live a simple comfortable life. He intends to never work again, after his six space flights. The currency used in the state was universal, controlled by a personal credit card. Because most jobs were automated, few people had to work, so most people lived off of a set welfare, and those selected to work were given a little extra compensation. Si was one of these people. Gubelin and Perregaux are both horrified by the fact that Pond has decided to take an early retirement. He was their only pilot for their space program, and if they were to get another, it would take at least a year of training. Without a pilot, they are worried that their funding will be cut, and the space program will be shut down. They scheme together as to how to get Pond back in the space program. They think that the only way to get him back would be to make sure he was left without any money, and therefore would have no choice but to return to his former position. \nSi is planning a big night out. He has always gone and celebrated when there was a cause, and tonight, he was planning to spend at least half of all the money in his account.

People who don't work have their assigned shares to live off of, and those that are selected to work are given a little extra as compensation. When the society was first formed, they tried to give everyone work, but they realised that it was no good to have people working for two hours, two days a week, so they created the draft lottery. Most people live in small apartments, and the fortunate living Si, are able to afford vacuum tubes, which can take you anywhere in an instant. It is only the swankiest of places that have real people working in them. All payment is automated, and different settings of rooms can be changed in an instant in fancy hotels.

It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble\nwas yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of\nguards in Estates-General Correctional Institution—better known to\nits inmates as the Jug—and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent\nof trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to\nreach his captaincy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like\nher into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she\ncouldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block\nguard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the\n  <i>\n   Civil\nService Guide to Prison Administration\n  </i>\n  : \"Detainees will be permitted\nto speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary\nwas a man who lived by the book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She burst out: \"I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told\nme I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush\nup, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and\ntold them I refused to mop.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk—that's what she was telling you\nto do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up, Sodaro.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Captain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was\nattractive and young—not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off\nto a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the\ndisciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and\nlooked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for\nhim to judge their cases.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your\ncell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you\nshould have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first\noffense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in\nthe mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The\nblock guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench,\nand she claimed the same business—said she didn't understand when the\nother one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard\nwarned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I\ndon't care. I don't care!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the only thing to do—for her own sake as much as for his. He\nhad managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted\nto say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up\nforever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was\nclearly the next step for her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet\nto Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here.\nWhat's she in for?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to\nviolate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her,\nCap'n. She's a figger-lover!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked\n\"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the\nsmell from his nose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty\nbusiness? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the\nyard, wondering about her. She'd had every advantage—decent Civil\nService parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If\nanything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and\nlook what she had made of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no\nexception, but with the difference that his is the one species that\ncreates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment\nthat clans formed, specialization began—the hunters using the weapons\nmade by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the\nceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From\nthe born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved\nto the point of smaller contact and less communication between the\nspecializations, until now they could understand each other on only the\nmost basic physical necessities—and not even always then.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree\nof civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation\nof each specialization—social and genetic measures to make them\nbreed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man,\nor at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the\nspecializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer\nor Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized,\nwould be good at no specialization.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups\nare the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal\nenforcement of a demonstrable fact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and\ntouched his cap as O'Leary passed by.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Evening.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted those\nthings, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'd\nnoticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep—the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position—better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  proud of it. It was\n  <i>\n   right\n  </i>\n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If he had happened to be born a fig—a\n  <i>\n   clerk\n  </i>\n  , he corrected\nhimself—if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk—or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a—well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n  <i>\n   comfortable\n  </i>\n  it must be to be a wipe—a\n  <i>\n   laborer\n  </i>\n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, he wouldn't\n  <i>\n   really\n  </i>\n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n  <i>\n   meant\n  </i>\n  to be—\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conan, now—he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going—and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every prison has its Greensleeves—sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And punishment is what you get.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back—after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outside guard shrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Detail,\n  <i>\n   halt\n  </i>\n  !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady—she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners—they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time—only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate—and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules—Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were\nlaborers—\"wipes,\" for short—or, at any rate, they had been once.\nThey had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even\nfor them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big,\ngrinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe\nfive-footer with the build of a water moccasin—and the sad, stupid\neyes of a calf.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so\nas not to disturb the lady!\" He screeched with howling, maniacal\nlaughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble,\nFlock!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that,\nSauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The howling started all over again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off\nthe tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take\na turn in here for a while?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah, I don't know why I\ndon't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat\nyour head off!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he\ngrinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know\nyou can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut\n  <i>\n   up\n  </i>\n  !\" yelled the inside guard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help\nit. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting\nunder her skin. They weren't even—even\n  <i>\n   human\n  </i>\n  , she told herself\nmiserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the\nsatisfaction of hearing her—they were animals!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly\nthat resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly\nnormal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against\nthe vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was\n  <i>\n   good\n  </i>\n  that\nSauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious\nsystem—\n </p>\n <p>\n  But did they have to scream so?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to\nweeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!\n </p>\n <p>\n  It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless,\nbecause noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very\nlong.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his\nlittle round eyes looked terrified—as perhaps they should have. Warden\nGodfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in\nthe Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the\nlast decent job he would have in his life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trouble?\n  <i>\n   What\n  </i>\n  trouble?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Leary shrugged. \"Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This\nafternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what\ndid you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball\nin the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the\noutside—an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes\ndon't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that\nit didn't\n  <i>\n   smell\n  </i>\n  right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For instance—Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's\na pretty good old girl—that's why she's the block orderly. She's a\nlifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women.\nBut today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she\ntold Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now\nMathias wouldn't—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about\nthat kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured\nhimself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a\ndesk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped\na pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the\nscalding heat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have\nyour job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is\njust as important as my job,\" he said piously. \"\n  <i>\n   Everybody's\n  </i>\n  job is\njust as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to\nour own jobs. We don't want to try to\n  <i>\n   pass\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was\nthat for the warden to talk to him?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean,\nafter all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was\na great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \"\n  <i>\n   You\n  </i>\n  know you\ndon't want to worry about\n  <i>\n   my\n  </i>\n  end of running the prison. And\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  don't\nwant to worry about\n  <i>\n   yours\n  </i>\n  . You see?\" And he folded his hands and\nsmiled like a civil-service Buddha.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  O'Leary choked back his temper. \"Warden, I'm telling you that there's\ntrouble coming up. I smell the signs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with\nall your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee,\nmade a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not\nnoticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into\nit this time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you\ntonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the—'\nOh, curse the thing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary;\nthey gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What\nthe devil do you want? Don't you know I'm—What? You did\n  <i>\n   what\n  </i>\n  ?\nYou're going to WHAT?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.\nWhatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like\nclamshells in a steamer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he hung up—more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his\nfingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it\ndidn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.\nBecause five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the\nhard-timers of the Greensleeves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His name was Flock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,\nthought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the\ncrazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the\nface of an agonized man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did\nhappen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that\nactuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison\nrules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the\nGreensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case\nhad to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rest period\" it was called—in the rule book. The inmates had a less\nlovely term for it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat\nbed—nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields\nhad a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out.\nScore one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed\nthe backs of her thighs gingerly—and slowly, slowly, for the eddy\ncurrents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against\nrubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She\nproudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds.\nHe didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while\nshe attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male\nprisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was\ngrateful. At least she didn't have to live\n  <i>\n   quite\n  </i>\n  like a fig—like an\nunderprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's\nthe matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an\nasbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe.\nCouldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real\nenough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I—I—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The guard lumbered around\nFlock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in\nhere, he told himself—not for the first time. And imagine, some people\ndidn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he\nrealized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning.\nAlmost like meat scorching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the\nstinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to\nget all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if\nhe didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was\npretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little\nvain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability\nto make the rounds in two minutes, every time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every time but this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was\nFlock—astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't\nbeen in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there\nwas something that glinted and smoked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut\nwith pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining,\nsmoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though\nit had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God\nknows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how—filed,\nfiled to sharpness over endless hours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No wonder Flock moaned—the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly\ncooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv\nhad been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get\nhurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell\nhim not to, you hear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was nearly fainting with the pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he hadn't let go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't let go. And he didn't stop.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  IV\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Flock on the phone to the warden—Flock with his eyes still\nstreaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing\nthe two bound deck guards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the\nvoice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and\nhating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt\nhimself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the\nguards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got\nyour guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And he snapped the connection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  O'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated,\nand picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison\noperator: \"Get me the governor—fast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Riot!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Seniority\nwith his manager and their wives—and just when he was holding the\nPorkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Field\nto the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to a\nRed Alert that was real.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highway\ncheckpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the\nnineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Riot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in\nevery limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds of\nthousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under the\nimpact of the news from the prison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merely\na street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasers\nrelaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the\ncorrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipes\nand no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The\nairmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of\nthe alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched\nand yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained\nand their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled\nfor tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids\ncouldn't get up yet—it was the middle of the night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers\nstruggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing\narea to hear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They caught the words from a distance—not quite correctly. \"Riot!\"\ngasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I\n  <i>\n   told\n  </i>\n  Charlie they'd get out of hand and—Alys, we aren't safe. You\nknow how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club\nand stand right by the door and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children\nquerulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the\nuse of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd\nbetter come along to Supply with me and draw a gun—you'll need it\nbefore this night is over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the\nscramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of\ntrouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called\nthem out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such\nlevels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a\nwhistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they\nwere the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up\ntheir picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers\nin each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were ready for the breakout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there wasn't any breakout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The\nhelicopters hung on—still ready, still waiting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again.\nThey stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed.\nThe prison below them was washed with light—from the guard posts on\nthe walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of\nthe guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed\nland, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed\nlights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion\nfrom their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded\ntenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to\nwindow; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier\nyelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the\nwhirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout\nfrom the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be\nright in the middle of it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it—for every\nman, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of\nit. There was no place anywhere that would be spared.\n  <i>\n   No mixing.\n  </i>\n  That\nwas the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There's no harm in\na family fight—and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers\na clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties\nthan blood or skin?\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and\nonce they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The\nbreakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever\nknown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to\ncome.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "bb1472ba897f44c49a4476a40f783490", "response_text": "Liam O’Leary is the captain of the guards at the Estates-General Correctional Institution (also known as the Jug).

It is initially said that the direction of evolution is towards specialization, and this also includes mankind. However, humans can create whatever environment they want to specialize in. The warden tells O'Leary that he should not involve himself in the warden's affairs and that he had his own job to do too. He emphasizes that everybody's jobs are important, but it is even more essential to stick to one's own and not pass on another person's occupation. Although O'Leary is upset at how the warden ignores his warnings, Schluckebier reminds him that 'specialization is the goal for civilization,' which means he does not want to worry about O'Leary's job nor should O'Leary worry about his.

This is a holdup.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall at\nhis desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger.\nThere was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic named\nRodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English and\nMiss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was Mister\nAnderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There was\nMrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in their\njoint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward\n(Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollars\ndimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his father\nin the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels,\nwithdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were three\nbank robbers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, they\nall wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers,\nbrown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefs\nover the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulled\nlow over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-two\ncalibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One of\nthe others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and\nsaid to him in a low voice, \"Think about retirement, my friend.\" The\nthird one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walked\nquickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it with\nmoney.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was just like the movies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall and\nthe customers all over against the back wall, while the second man\nstayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed money\ninto the black satchel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man by the door said, \"Hurry up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man with the satchel said, \"One more drawer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, \"Keep your\nshirt on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ran\npelting in her stocking feet for the door.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The man by the door spread his arms out and shouted, \"Hey!\" The man\nwith the gun swung violently back, cursing, and fired the gun. But he'd\nbeen moving too fast, and so had Miss English, and all he hit was the\nbrass plate on Mr. Featherhall's desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man by the door caught Miss English in a bear hug. She promptly did\nher best to scratch his eyes out. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson went scooting\nout the front door and running down the street toward the police\nstation in the next block, shouting, \"Help! Help! Robbery!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man with the gun cursed some more. The man with the satchel came\nrunning around from behind the counter, and the man by the door tried\nto keep Miss English from scratching his eyes out. Then the man with\nthe gun hit Miss English on the head. She fell unconscious to the\nfloor, and all three of them ran out of the bank to the car out front,\nin which sat a very nervous-looking fourth man, gunning the engine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everyone except Miss English ran out after the bandits, to watch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Things got very fast and very confused then. Two police cars came\ndriving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank,\nand the car with the four robbers in it lurched away from the curb and\ndrove straight down the street toward the police station. The police\ncars and the getaway car passed one another, with everybody shooting\nlike the ships in pirate movies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was so much confusion that it looked as though the bank robbers\nwere going to get away after all. The police cars were aiming the wrong\nway and, as they'd come down with sirens wailing, there was a clear\npath behind them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, after the getaway car had gone more than two blocks, it suddenly\nstarted jouncing around. It smacked into a parked car and stopped. And\nall the police went running down there to clap handcuffs on the robbers\nwhen they crawled dazedly out of their car.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey,\" said Eddie Clayhorn, ten years old. \"Hey, that was something,\nhuh, Mom?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come along home,\" said his mother, grabbing his hand. \"We don't want\nto be involved.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"It was the nuttiest thing,\" said Detective-Sergeant Stevenson. \"An\noperation planned that well, you'd think they'd pay attention to their\ngetaway car, you know what I mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Detective-Sergeant Pauling shrugged. \"They always slip up,\" he said.\n\"Sooner or later, on some minor detail, they always slip up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, but their\n  <i>\n   tires\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" said Pauling, \"it was a stolen car. I suppose they just grabbed\nwhatever was handiest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What I can't figure out,\" said Stevenson, \"is exactly what made those\ntires do that. I mean, it was a hot day and all, but it wasn't\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  hot. And they weren't going that fast. I don't think you could go fast\nenough to melt your tires down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pauling shrugged again. \"We got them. That's the important thing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Still and all, it's nutty. They're free and clear, barrelling out\nRockaway toward the Belt, and all at once their tires melt, the tubes\nblow out and there they are.\" Stevenson shook his head. \"I can't figure\nit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth,\" suggested Pauling. \"They picked\nthe wrong car to steal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  doesn't make sense, either,\" said Stevenson. \"Why steal a\ncar that could be identified as easily as that one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why? What was it, a foreign make?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, it was a Chevvy, two-tone, three years old, looked just like half\nthe cars on the streets. Except that in the trunk lid the owner had\nburned in 'The Scorpion' in big black letters you could see half a\nblock away.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe they didn't notice it when they stole the car,\" said Pauling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For a well-planned operation like this one,\" said Stevenson, \"they\nmade a couple of really idiotic boners. It doesn't make any sense.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do they have to say about it?\" Pauling demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing, what do you expect? They'll make no statement at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The squad-room door opened, and a uniformed patrolman stuck his head\nin. \"The owner of that Chevvy's here,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right,\" said Stevenson. He followed the patrolman down the hall to the\nfront desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, tall\nand paunchy. \"John Hastings,\" he said. \"They say you have my car here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I believe so, yes,\" said Stevenson. \"I'm afraid it's in pretty bad\nshape.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So I was told over the phone,\" said Hastings grimly. \"I've contacted\nmy insurance company.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd come\nwith me?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  On the way around, Stevenson said, \"I believe you reported the car\nstolen almost immediately after it happened.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" said Hastings. \"I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm\na wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car\nwas gone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You left the keys in it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, why not?\" demanded Hastings belligerently. \"If I'm making just\na quick stop—I never spend more than five minutes with any one\ncustomer—I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The car was stolen,\" Stevenson reminded him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hastings grumbled and glared. \"It's always been perfectly safe up till\nnow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. In here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. \"It's ruined!\"\nhe cried. \"What did you do to the tires?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. \"Look at that!\nThere's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What\ndid you use, incendiary bullets?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stevenson shook his head. \"No, sir. When that happened they were two\nblocks away from the nearest policeman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hmph.\" Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,\n\"What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of\n  <i>\n   kids\n  </i>\n  had stolen the car.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't a bunch of kids,\" Stevenson told him. \"It was four\nprofessional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in\na bank holdup.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then why did they do\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the\ncrudely-lettered words, \"The Scorpion\" burned black into the paint of\nthe trunk lid. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"It wasn't there before\nthe car was stolen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stevenson frowned. \"Now, why in the world did they do that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suggest,\" said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, \"you ask them that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stevenson shook his head. \"It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking\nabout anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us.\" He looked at the\ntrunk lid again. \"It's the nuttiest thing,\" he said thoughtfully....\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was on Wednesday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the\n  <i>\n   Daily News\n  </i>\n  brought a crank\nletter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,\nthe address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a\nnewspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Mr. Editor:\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion\nfights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging\nScorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  Sincerely yours,\n  <br/>\n  THE SCORPION\n </p>\n <p>\n  The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It\ndidn't rate a line in the paper.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man\nwent berserk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica\nBay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,\ncomposed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a\nMotor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the\nthird time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,\nbrooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to\nawaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he\nreally ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then\nallegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma\nStodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the\nhouse at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked\nbedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and\n\"stop acting like a child.\" Neighbors reported to the police that they\nheard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, \"Go away! Can't you let a\nman sleep?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,\na two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of\nsimilar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted\nfrom his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being\nannoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells\nat them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the\nhand and shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming\nout the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,\n\"Murder! Murder!\" At this point, neighbors called the police. One\nneighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television\nstations, thereby earning forty dollars in \"news-tips\" rewards.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the Belt\nParkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at Idlewild\nAirport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a\nposition across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work\nwith a Zoomar lens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house,\nfiring at anything that moved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One\nconcentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors\nand ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to\nsearch for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home\naudience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and\nundershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of the\nhouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere,\nand firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the\ncorner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr.\nHiggins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The\npolice used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they\nhad the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway.\nHiggins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge\nanyone present to hand-to-hand combat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day\nand all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken.\nHiggins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and\ndramatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of\nshooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped and\nthrew the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered\ndown to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell\nbarrel first onto the lawn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a\nwounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall\ninto the arms of the waiting police.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually\ntrying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was\nshouting: \"My hands! My hands!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers\nwere red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was\nanother burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn\nointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The\nneighbors went home and telephoned their friends.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the\nprecincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William\nStevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy\nindividual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle.\nHe touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the\nstock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, \"The\nScorpion.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political\nconnections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As\nCaptain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both\nmore imaginative than most—\"You gotta be able to second-guess the\nsmart boys\"—and to be a complete realist—\"You gotta have both feet\non the ground.\" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was\nbest not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.\n\"Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?\" he demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not sure,\" admitted Stevenson. \"But we've got these two things.\nFirst, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for\nno reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.\nThen, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle\nall of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to\nprove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He says he put that on there himself,\" said the captain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stevenson shook his head. \"His\n  <i>\n   lawyer\n  </i>\n  says he put it on there.\nHiggins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's\ncase. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He put it on there himself, Stevenson,\" said the captain with weary\npatience. \"What are you trying to prove?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And\nwhat about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They were defective,\" said Hanks promptly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the\ntrunk?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain. \"Kids put it on before the car\nwas stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?\nWhat do\n  <i>\n   they\n  </i>\n  say?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They say they didn't do it,\" said Stevenson. \"And they say they never\nsaw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been\nthere.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain shook his head. \"I don't get it,\" he admitted. \"What are\nyou trying to prove?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess,\" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, \"I\nguess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made\nthat rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are\nyou trying to hand me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All I know,\" insisted Stevenson, \"is what I see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And all\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  know,\" the captain told him, \"is Higgins put that name on\nhis rifle himself. He says so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And what made it so hot?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do\nyou\n  <i>\n   think\n  </i>\n  made it hot?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All of a sudden?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How come the same name showed up each time, then?\" Stevenson asked\ndesperately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these\nthings happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they\nwrite 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens\nall the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But there's no explanation—\" started Stevenson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just\n  <i>\n   gave\n  </i>\n  you the\nexplanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty\nidea—like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there\nwas a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned\nrefrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting\nall upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.\nRemember?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I remember,\" said Stevenson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,\" the captain advised him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a\ncrank letter to the\n  <i>\n   Daily News\n  </i>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Mr. Editor,\n </p>\n <p>\n  You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could\nnot escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is\nsafe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  Sincerely yours,\n  <br/>\n  THE SCORPION\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had\nseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the\nsame place, and forgotten.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around\nfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up\ncarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on\nyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a\nJD.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances\non two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and\nthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides\nclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys\nfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that\nhad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and\ndetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.\nThe weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no\npistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner\nwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both\nentrances.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate\nclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play\nchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of\nthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might\ncome wandering through.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen\nyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,\ngum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the\nScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to\nher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were\ndark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,\nparticularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone\npole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet\nRaider jacket and waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The\nrumble had started.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the\nstreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them\ncarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks\non.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey,\nyou kids. Take off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, lady,\" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, \"we got a long\nway to go to get home.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" said another kid, in a black mask, \"and we're late as it is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I couldn't care less,\" Judy told them callously. \"You can't go down\nthat street.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete\nand elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt\nand a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a\nblack knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. \"Why can't we go down\nthere?\" this apparition demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because I said so,\" Judy told him. \"Now, you kids get away from here.\nTake off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. \"Hey, they're\nfighting down there!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a rumble,\" said Judy proudly. \"You twerps don't want to be\ninvolved.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went\nrunning around Judy and dashing off down the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, Eddie!\" shouted one of the other kids. \"Eddie, come back!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase\nthe one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would\ncome running along after her. She didn't know what to do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.\n\"Cheez,\" said one of the kids. \"The cops!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fuzz!\" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the\nschoolyard, shouting, \"Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the\nschoolyard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving\ntheir arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling\noff their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering.\nThey were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's\nwarning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both\nschoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy\nand the rumble was over.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great\nbig blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in\nthe yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was\nimpatient as well. \"All right, Stevenson,\" he said. \"Make it fast, I've\ngot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing\nof yours again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm afraid it is, Captain,\" said Stevenson. \"Did you see the morning\npaper?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Hanks sighed. \"Stevenson,\" he said wearily, \"are you going to\ntry to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's\nthe problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'\" Stevenson told\nhim. \"One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the\nChallengers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So they changed their name,\" said Hanks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted\nthat much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever\nseeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A bunch of juvenile delinquents,\" said Hanks in disgust. \"You take\ntheir word?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain, did you read the article in the paper?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I glanced through it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started\nfighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once\nall the metal they were carrying—knives and tire chains and coins and\nbelt buckles and everything else—got freezing cold, too cold to touch.\nAnd then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to\npull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later\ncollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been\nbranded 'The Scorpion.'\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now, let\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  tell\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard\nthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they\nthrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been\npart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before\nthey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed\nup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it\nbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the\nneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not\nbothering anybody.\n  <i>\n   That's\n  </i>\n  what happened. And all this talk about\nfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec\npunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to\nworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid\ngangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or\nyou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.\nNow, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n \n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "101", "uid": "0918340a3d5b4c4ab394b2b3a512fafa", "response_text": "The story opens up on a bank robbery. Three men, wearing identical outfits and masks, walk in and threaten the citizens in the bank, raising a weapon. As the men are taking money from behind the counter, a woman, Miss English, makes a run for the door. She is shot at but missed, caught by one of the men at the door, and another citizen, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call for help. The men flee the bank and hop into a stolen car, just missing the incoming police. As the men get away, the car suddenly malfunctions and crashes into another car, and they are eventually caught by the police. Detective Stevenson discusses the incident with Detective Pauling, and he is perplexed by how the tires of the stolen car seemed to melt instantly, and how the words \"The Scorpion\" were branded into the car. The owner of the stolen car, John Hastings, arrives, and he confirms that the words were not on the car before it was stolen. Two days later, the Daily News receives a crank letter, addressed from \"The Scorpion\" and explaining that he fights crime, threatening criminals. The letter was not published. About a month after the robbery, another incident occurs in Brooklyn, where Jerome Higgins murders his wife and injures his sister after spending days in his bedroom. Police and cameramen arrive at his home, where a standoff occurs for an hour before Higgins suddenly throws his rifle and runs outside, his hands burned severely. Stevenson finds the rifle and sees \"The Scorpion\" burned into the side of it. Stevenson goes to Captain Hanks, questioning the similarities between the two events, and Hanks dismisses his conspiracies. The Daily Mail receives another letter, but still does not publish it. On Halloween, two gangs, the Challengers and the Scarlet Raiders, plan a rumble over territory. Judy Canzanetti is a lookout for the Scarlet Raiders, and she is guarding the street when a group of children approach her. Judy warns them to leave, but one of the children goes around her and runs down the street. Suddenly, the police arrive, and Judy warns the gang, but then sees them jumping around and throwing their weapons and jackets.

The getaway car reaches ahead until the car crashes, and the police clap handcuffs on the robbers, taking them to the station. \nBack in the station Detective-Sergeant Stevenson discusses with his colleague what happened. The tires of the getaway car seemed to have melted. The car was normal, apart from the words \"the scorpion\", burned in big black letters on the trunk lid. They meet the owner of the stolen car at the station, who tells them that he never put that sign on the car. That was on Wednesday. On Friday, the Daily News is sent a crank letter from someone signed \"the scorpion\" who tells the paper to warn their readers that \"the scorpion fights crime\" and that criminals are not safe.\nJerome Higgins, a man from Brooklyn goes crazy and kills his wife and injures his sister with a gun. Both neighbours and police surround the house after his sister Mrs.Strober escapes the house. inside, Higgins goes ballistic, shooting at random.

The last one takes a black satchel bag and fills it with money. Then, they join the fourth robber in a stolen car while the police chase them. It seems that they will get away, but the tires melt, which gives the police the opportunity to apprehend them. On Wednesday, Detective-Sergeant Stevenson finds it very strange, but Detective-Sergeant Pauling tells him it is common for plans to have these flaws. Stevenson mentions that the car has 'The Scorpion' burned into it just as the owner arrives. John Hastings says that he reported his car as soon as it was stolen. Stevenson is surprised that he would leave his keys in it, but Hastings says it is usually safe for him because he is a wine and liquor salesman. Hastings is angry at the police for melting his tires, but Stevenson says the police had no part in that. Both of them are confused by the writing on the car since it was not there before. On Friday, the Daily News receives a letter from The Scorpion that warns the readers of the paper because it fights crime. However, the letter is ignored and filed into the wastebasket instead. The second incident happens in early August when a Brooklyn man named Jerome Higgins goes berserk after failing a Civil Service exam for the third time. The crime is in Canarsie, in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. Mrs. Higgins and his sister, Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, try to wake him up; Mister Higgins kills his wife and injures his sister with a hunting rifle. He then goes on a rampage, barricading himself in the house and shooting at anything that moves. Policemen, firemen, neighbors, ambulance attendants, and even two cameramen from the mobile unit are present. After one hour, Higgins plans to shoot at the camera, but he suddenly throws his rifle away. He then complains about his hands, which are severely burned, and Stevenson finds the words 'The Scorpion' present again. Precinct Captain Hanks tells him that his idea of an external force fighting crime out there is silly, while the Daily News receives a second letter from The Scorpion. The third case details a Hallowe'en rumble in a schoolyard. Judy Canzanetti is made to stand chicken, and she tells a group of kids in Hallowe'en masks to stay away from the schoolyard. The kid named Eddie dashes down the street, and the cops soon appear after. Stevenson tries to bring up how strange it is for both gangs to have 'The Scorpion' on their jackets when the conflict was a territorial war.

Picking a moment, one of the hostages, Miss English, rushes out, but she is stopped, while another captive, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call the police. The robbers hit Miss English into unconsciousness and run away. Police cars come and go in the wrong way, but surprisingly manage to capture the robbers after all. The stupid mistake of the robbers seems suspicious as the car's tires melted for no reason and the stolen car was very noticeable with \"The Scorpion\" written in the back. When the car owner comes, he is very angry and upset, and he mentions the inscription wasn't there before the robbery. Soon, a letter from \"The Scorpion\" is received by a newspaper, saying that the sender will keep fighting crime. About one month later, a clerk murders his wife from a rifle after going berserk. This man, Mr. Higgins, barricades himself at home and fires outside in defense, while his sister runs to the police and the neighbors call. After an hour of no success in arresting the man, he runs out himself with his hands being terribly burnt. The same detective who led the first case, Stevenson, comes to the scene, and sees an engraving \"The Scorpion\" on the rifle. Higgins' lawyer claims the inscription was put by his client, while the least denies it, which the lawyer uses to proclaim him insane. Stevenson holds on to someone else making those inscriptions while Captain Hanks denies the version. Stevenson keeps posing questions making the case strange, but Hanks tries to close the case with explaining everything as primitively as possible. Hanks orders Stevenson to forget his ideas of someone pretending to be a superhero and even threatens him reminding about a precedent. Another warning letter to the readers comes from \"The Scorpion\" to the newspaper, but it's not printed again. Another story takes place on Halloween, two gangs meet to fight for a school yard with knifes and chains. A fifteen year old girl Judy stands chicken on the corner during the fight and sees a bunch of kids heading home, she says them to go another way, but one kid sees the rumble and rushes there. Suddenly the cops come and the gangs do not hear Judy's warning, everyone is arrested. \"The Scorpion\" appears on the participants' jackets after the fight. Turns out the fight didn't happen as all the metallic weapons and leather jackets suddenly got extremely cold to hold.

Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches?\nOur reputations don't go outside our own fields,\" Mitchell said. \"But\nnow Macklin—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein\nin the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word\n\"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether\nhis Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been\nable to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but\nlooked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The\ngovernment took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the\nIdeal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the past seven years Macklin—who\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  the Advanced Studies\nDepartment of Firestone University—had been involved in devising a\nfaster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the\nnearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knew\nthat the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of\n  <i>\n   Ad\nastra per aspirin\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mild\nstroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It was\nknown that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of\nthe headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several\nweeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen\naround the campus.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the\nlaboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chair\nbehind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up?\" Ferris demanded,\npausing in mid-stride.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I imagine he will,\" Mitchell said. \"Macklin's always seemed a decent\nenough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trustees\nmeetings.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's always treated me like dirt,\" Ferris said heatedly. \"Everyone on\nthis campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash in\ntheir smug faces.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack of\nscientific detachment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There came a discreet knock on the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please come in,\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. He\nlooked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell\nsuspected that that was his intention.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. \"Good of you to ask me over,\nSteven.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. \"How have you been,\nHarold?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. \"Fine, thank you,\ndoctor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. \"Now\nwhat's this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep the\nexplanation simple. Biology isn't my field, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell moved around the desk casually. \"Actually, Doctor, we haven't\nthe right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be an\nelement of risk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. \"Now you\nhave me intrigued. What is it all about?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches,\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin nodded. \"That's right, Steven. Migraine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That must be terrible,\" Ferris said. \"All your fine reputation and\nlavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearing\nagony begins, can it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, Harold, it isn't,\" Macklin admitted. \"What does your project have\nto do with my headaches?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said, \"what would you say the most common complaint\nof man is?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I would have said the common cold,\" Macklin replied, \"but I suppose\nfrom what you have said you mean headaches.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Headaches,\" Mitchell agreed. \"Everybody has them at some time in his\nlife. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide by\ntheir headaches.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Macklin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But think,\" Ferris interjected, \"what a boon it would be if everyone\ncould be cured of headaches\n  <i>\n   forever\n  </i>\n  by one simple injection.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But it\nwould please about everybody else.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscular\npains,\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see. Are you two saying you\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  such a shot? Can you cure\nheadaches?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We think we can,\" Ferris said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How can you have a specific for a number of different causes?\" Macklin\nasked. \"I know that much about the subject.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  a number of different causes for headaches—nervous\nstrain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors,\nover-indulgence—but there is one\n  <i>\n   effect\n  </i>\n  of all of this, the one real\ncause of headaches,\" Mitchell announced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have definitely established this for this first time,\" Ferris added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's fine,\" Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. \"And this effect that\nproduces headaches is?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain,\" Mitchell\nsaid eagerly. \"That is, the constriction of blood vessels in the\ntelencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It's caused by an\nover-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a\nvirus that feeds on pituitrin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean\nthe end of the race as well,\" Macklin said. \"In certain areas it is\nvaluable to have a constriction of blood vessels.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The virus,\" Ferris explained, \"can easily be localized and stabilized.\nA colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral\nvessels—and only the cerebral vessels—so that the cerebrospinal fluid\ndoesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. \"If this really\nworks, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuff\nmakes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than the\nmigraine. How should I go about removing my curse?\" He reinserted the\npipe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate,\" Ferris said. \"Our\ndiscovery will work.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Will work,\" Macklin said thoughtfully. \"The operative word. It\n  <i>\n   hasn't\n  </i>\n  worked then?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly it has,\" Ferris said. \"On rats, on chimps....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But not on humans?\" Macklin asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not yet,\" Mitchell admitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Macklin said. \"Well.\" He thumped pipe ashes out into his palm.\n\"Certainly you can get volunteers. Convicts. Conscientious objectors\nfrom the Army.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We want you,\" Ferris told him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin coughed. \"I don't want to overestimate my value but the\ngovernment wouldn't like it very well if I died in the middle of this\nproject. My wife would like it even less.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris turned his back on the mathematician. Mitchell could see him\nmouthing the word\n  <i>\n   yellow\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I know it's a tremendous favor to\nask of a man of your position. But you can understand our problem.\nUnless we can produce quick, conclusive and dramatic proof of our\nstudies we can get no more financial backing. We\n  <i>\n   should\n  </i>\n  run a\nlarge-scale field test. But we haven't the time or money for that.\nWe can cure the headaches of one person and that's the limit of our\nresources.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm tempted,\" Macklin said hesitantly, \"but the answer is go. I mean\n'\n  <i>\n   no\n  </i>\n  '. I'd like to help you out, but I'm afraid I owe too much to\nothers to take the rest—the risk, I mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin ran the back of his knuckles across his forehead. \"I really\nwould like to take you up on it. When I start making slips like that it\nmeans another attack of migraine. The drilling, grinding pain through\nmy temples and around my eyeballs. The flashes of light, the rioting\npools of color playing on the back of my lids. Ugh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris smiled. \"Gynergen makes you sick, does it, doctor? Produces\nnausea, eh? The pain of that turns you almost wrong side out, doesn't\nit? You aren't much better off with it than without, are you? I've\nheard some say they preferred the migraine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin carefully arranged his pipe along with the tools he used to\ntend it in a worn leather case. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"what is the worst\nthat could happen to me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Low blood pressure,\" Ferris said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's not so bad,\" Macklin said. \"How low can it get?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When your heart stops, your blood pressure goes to its lowest point,\"\nMitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A dew of perspiration had bloomed on Macklin's forehead. \"Is there much\nrisk of that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Practically none,\" Mitchell said. \"We have to give you the worst\npossibilities.\n  <i>\n   All\n  </i>\n  our test animals survived and seem perfectly happy\nand contented. As I said, the virus is self-stabilizing. Ferris and I\nare confident that there is no danger.... But we may be wrong.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin held his head in both hands. \"Why did you two select\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're an important man, doctor,\" Ferris said. \"Nobody would care if\nMitchell or I cured ourselves of headaches—they might not even believe\nus if we said we did. But the proper authorities will believe a man\nof your reputation. Besides, neither of us has a record of chronic\nmigraine. You do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, I do,\" Macklin said. \"Very well. Go ahead. Give me your\ninjection.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell cleared his throat. \"Are you positive, doctor?\" he asked\nuncertainly. \"Perhaps you would like a few days to think it over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No! I'm ready. Go ahead, right now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's a simple release,\" Ferris said smoothly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin groped in his pocket for a pen.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ferris!\" Mitchell yelled, slamming the laboratory door behind him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right here,\" the small man said briskly. He was sitting at a work\ntable, penciling notes. \"I've been expecting you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doctor—Harold—you shouldn't have given this story to the\nnewspapers,\" Mitchell said. He tapped the back of his hand against the\nfolded paper.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On the contrary, I should and I did,\" Ferris answered. \"We wanted\nsomething dramatic to show to the trustees and here it is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, we wanted to show our proof to the trustees—but not broadcast\nunverified results to the press. It's too early for that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be so stuffy and conservative, Mitchell! Macklin's cured, isn't\nhe? By established periodic cycle he should be suffering hell right\nnow, shouldn't he? But thanks to our treatment he is perfectly happy,\nwith no unfortunate side effects such as gynergen produces.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a significant test case, yes. But not enough to go to the\nnewspapers with. If it wasn't enough to go to the press with, it wasn't\nenough to try and breach the trustees with. Don't you see? The public\nwill hand down a ukase demanding our virus, just as they demanded the\nSalk vaccine and the Grennell serum.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The shrill call of the telephone interrupted Mitchell's objections.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris excused himself and crossed to the instrument. He answered it\nand listened for a moment, his face growing impatient.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's Macklin's wife,\" Ferris said. \"Do you want to talk to her? I'm no\ngood with hysterical women.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hysterical?\" Mitchell muttered in alarm and went to the phone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello?\" Mitchell said reluctantly. \"Mrs. Macklin?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are the other one,\" the clear feminine voice said. \"Your name is\nMitchell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She couldn't have sounded calmer or more self-possessed, Mitchell\nthought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right, Mrs. Macklin. I'm Dr. Steven Mitchell, Dr. Ferris's\nassociate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you have a license to dispense narcotics?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean by that, Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said sharply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I used to be a nurse, Dr. Mitchell.

I think I had better talk to you later when you are\ncalmer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell dropped the receiver heavily. \"What could be wrong with\nMacklin?\" he asked without removing his hand from the telephone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris frowned, making quotation marks above his nose. \"Let's have a\nlook at the test animals.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Together they marched over to the cages and peered through the\nhoneycomb pattern of the wire. The test chimp, Dean, was sitting\npeacefully in a corner scratching under his arms with the back of his\nknuckles. Jerry, their control in the experiment, who was practically\nDean's twin except that he had received no injection of the E-M Virus,\nwas stomping up and down punching his fingers through the wire,\nworrying the lock on the cage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jerry\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  a great deal more active than Dean,\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, but Dean isn't sick. He just doesn't seem to have as much nervous\nenergy to burn up. Nothing wrong with his thyroid either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They went to the smaller cages. They found the situation with the rats,\nBud and Lou, much the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know. Maybe they just have tired blood,\" Mitchell ventured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Iron deficiency anemia?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind, doctor. It was a form of humor. I think we had better see\nexactly what is wrong with Elliot Macklin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's nothing wrong with him,\" Ferris snapped. \"He's probably just\ntrying to get us in trouble, the ingrate!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Macklin's traditional ranch house was small but attractive in\naqua-tinted aluminum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under Mitchell's thumb the bell chimbed\n  <i>\n   dum-de-de-dum-dum-dum\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As they waited Mitchell glanced at Ferris. He seemed completely\nundisturbed, perhaps slightly curious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door unlatched and swung back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I'm sure we can help if there\nis anything wrong with your husband. This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr.\nMitchell.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You had certainly\n  <i>\n   better\n  </i>\n  help him, gentlemen.\" She stood out of the\ndoorway for them to pass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mrs. Macklin was an attractive brunette in her late thirties. She wore\nan expensive yellow dress. And she had a sharp-cornered jawline.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Army officer came out into the hall to meet them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are the gentlemen who gave Dr. Macklin the unauthorized\ninjection,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It wasn't a question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't like that 'unauthorized',\" Ferris snapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonel—Mitchell spotted the eagles on his green tunic—lifted\na heavy eyebrow. \"No? Are you medical doctors? Are you authorized to\ntreat illnesses?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We weren't treating an illness,\" Mitchell said. \"We were discovering a\nmethod of treatment. What concern is it of yours?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonel smiled thinly. \"Dr. Macklin is my concern. And everything\nthat happens to him. The Army doesn't like what you have done to him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell wondered desperately just what they had done to the man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can we see him?\" Mitchell asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not? You can't do much worse than murder him now. That might be\njust as well. We have laws to cover that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonel led them into the comfortable, over-feminine living room.\nMacklin sat in an easy chair draped in embroidery, smoking. Mitchell\nsuddenly realized Macklin used a pipe as a form of masculine protest to\nhis home surroundings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the coffee table in front of Macklin were some odd-shaped building\nblocks such as were used in nursery schools. A second uniformed\nman—another colonel but with the snake-entwined staff of the medical\ncorps in his insignia—was kneeling at the table on the marble-effect\ncarpet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Army physician stood up and brushed his knees, undusted from the\nscrupulously clean rug.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's wrong with him, Sidney?\" the other officer asked the doctor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a thing,\" Sidney said. \"He's the healthiest, happiest, most\nwell-adjusted man I've ever examined, Carson.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But—\" Colonel Carson protested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, he's changed all right,\" the Army doctor answered. \"He's not the\nsame man as he used to be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How is he different?\" Mitchell demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The medic examined Mitchell and Ferris critically before answering. \"He\nused to be a mathematical genius.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And now?\" Mitchell said impatiently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now he is a moron,\" the medic said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell tried to stop Colonel Sidney as he went past, but the doctor\nmumbled he had a report to make.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell and Ferris stared at Colonel Carson and Macklin and at each\nother.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did he mean, Macklin is an idiot?\" Mitchell asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not an idiot,\" Colonel Carson corrected primly. \"Dr. Macklin is a\nmoron. He's legally responsible, but he's extremely stupid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not so dumb,\" Macklin said defensively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" Carson said. \"I didn't intend any offense.\nBut according to all the standard intelligence tests we have given you,\nyour clinical intelligence quotient is that of a moron.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's just on book learning,\" Macklin said. \"There's a lot you learn\nin life that you don't get out of books, son.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm confident that's true, sir,\" Colonel Carson said. He turned to the\ntwo biologists. \"Perhaps we had better speak outside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But—\" Mitchell said, impatient to examine Macklin for himself. \"Very\nwell. Let's step into the hall.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris followed them docilely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What have you done to him?\" the colonel asked straightforwardly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We merely cured him of his headaches,\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell did his best to explain the F-M Virus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean,\" the Army officer said levelly \"you have infected him with\nsome kind of a disease to rot his brain?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no! Could I talk to the other man, the doctor? Maybe I can make\nhim understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All I want to know is why Elliot Macklin has been made as simple as if\nhe had been kicked in the head by a mule,\" Colonel Carson said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think I can explain,\" Ferris interrupted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can?\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ferris nodded. \"We made a slight miscalculation. It appears as if the\nvirus colony overcontrols the supply of posterior pituitary extract in\nthe cerebrum. It isn't more than necessary to stop headaches. But that\nnecessary amount of control to stop pain is too much to allow the brain\ncells to function properly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why won't they function?\" Carson roared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They don't get enough food—blood, oxygen, hemoglobin,\" Ferris\nexplained. \"The cerebral vessels don't contract enough to pump the\nblood through the brain as fast and as hard as is needed. The brain\ncells remain sluggish, dormant. Perhaps decaying.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonel yelled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell groaned. He was abruptly sure Ferris was correct.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The colonel drew himself to attention, fists trembling at his sides.\n\"I'll see you hung for treason! Don't you know what Elliot Macklin\nmeans to us? Do you want those filthy Luxemburgians to reach Pluto\nbefore we do? Macklin's formula is essential to the FTL engine. You\nmight just as well have blown up Washington, D.C. Better! The capital\nis replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearly\nonce in a human race.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just a moment,\" Mitchell interrupted, \"we can cure Macklin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You\n  <i>\n   can\n  </i>\n  ?\" Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man was\ngoing to clasp his hands and sink to his knees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We have\nantitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as a\nbeneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good!\" Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at the\nknees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just you wait a second now, boys,\" Elliot Macklin said. He was leaning\nin the doorway, holding his pipe. \"I've been listening to what you've\nbeen saying and I don't like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean you don't like it?\" Carson demanded. He added, \"Sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, doctor,\" Mitchell said eagerly, \"just as you used to be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   With\n  </i>\n  my headaches, like before?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to\nframe an answer. \"Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions\nproperly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is\na dismal failure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wouldn't go that far,\" Ferris remarked cheerfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw\nMacklin slowly shaking his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir!\" the mathematician said. \"I shall not go back to my original\nstate. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying,\nworrying.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean wondering,\" Mitchell said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Macklin nodded. \"Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing.\nHow high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity—say,\nwhat was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It's\npeaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife\nand all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him,\" Mitchell\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's not his decision to make,\" the colonel said. \"He's an idiot now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron. He seems an idiot compared to\nhis former level of intelligence but he's legally responsible. There\nare millions of morons running around loose in the United States. They\ncan get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of them\ndo. You can't force him into being cured.... At least, I don't\n  <i>\n   think\n  </i>\n  you can.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I can't. This is hardly a totalitarian state.\" The colonel looked\nmomentarily glum that it wasn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell looked back at Macklin. \"Where did his wife get to, Colonel?\nI don't think that even previously he made too many personal decisions\nfor himself. Perhaps she could influence him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe,\" the colonel said. \"Let's find her.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  They found Mrs. Macklin in the dining room, her face at the picture\nwindow an attractive silhouette. She turned as the men approached.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the colonel began, \"these gentlemen believe they can\ncure your husband of his present condition.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Really?\" she said. \"Did you speak to Elliot about that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Y-yes,\" Colonel Carson said, \"but he's not himself. He refused the\ntreatment. He wants to remain in his state of lower intelligence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded. \"If those are his wishes, I can't go against them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But Mrs. Macklin!\" Mitchell protested. \"You will have to get a court\norder overruling your husband's wishes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smoothed an eyebrow with the third finger of her right hand. \"That\nwas my original thought. But I've redecided.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Redecided!\" Carson burst out almost hysterically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. I can't go against Elliot's wishes. It would be monstrous to put\nhim back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again,\nwhere he never had a moment's peace from worry and pressure. He's happy\nnow. Like a child, but happy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the Army man said levelly, \"if you don't help us\nrestore your husband's mind we will be forced to get a court order\ndeclaring him incompetent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But he is not! Legally, I mean,\" the woman stormed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe not. It's a borderline case. But I think any court would give us\nthe edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once\nhe's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and\nFerris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin\nto sanity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The colonel looked smug. \"Why not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is\ninvolved.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of\nvascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to\ngive those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To\nparalyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose there's some chance of that. But without the treatment\nthere is\n  <i>\n   no\n  </i>\n  chance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs.\nMacklin,\" Mitchell interjected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her mouth grew petulant. \"I don't care. I would rather have a live\nhusband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him\ncomfortable....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led\nhim back into the hall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm no psychiatrist,\" Mitchell said, \"but I think she wants Macklin\nstupid. Prefers it that way. She's always dominated his personal life,\nand now she can dominate him completely.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is she? A monster?\" the Army officer muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Mitchell said. \"She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous\nof her husband's genius.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe,\" Carson said. \"I don't know.

Both heads were initialed \"M\" so it was all the\nsame.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his\nheart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from\nthe nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello?\" Elliot Macklin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the\nphone instead of his wife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you speak freely, doctor?\" Mitchell asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" the mathematician said. \"I can talk fine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I mean, are you alone?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, you want to know if my wife is around.

You worried for just a second if\nI could have some reason for not telling you the truth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose so,\" Macklin said humbly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've found yourself worrying—thinking—about a lot of other\nproblems since we left you, haven't you?

Their new injection that they have discovered will potentially cure Macklin of his incessant migraines, which plague the genius' daily life. Macklin is famed for being at the forefront of the research team that is almost finished developing a faster than light drive, to help the US army reach Pluto. The only thing in the way of the completion of this project could be Macklin's headaches. Mitchell and Ferris ask Macklin if he would like to be the trial patient for their new antidote, which they only have funding to test out on one person. The antidote consists of a virus that is injected into a specific spot in the brain, blocking off oxygen from entering, curing the patient of any headaches. After walking Macklin through the science behind it and Macklin signing some waivers, they deliver the treatment to him. \nThe next day, Ferris gives the story of their success with the Doctor to the newspapers, that is until they get a call form Macklin's wife. She tells him that her husband seems to be high on a form of heroin. To this the two scientists protest, but then go to check on their previous animal test subjects to see their state. All the animals tested appear fine, yet subdued. They decide to go and check up on Macklin. \nThey arrive at his house to meet a colonel at the door, who invites them into the living room, where Macklin is sitting. He has just been evaluated by the doctor, and it turns out that the vaccine has reduced his brain capacity, to the point where he is now a \"moron\". The oxygen that the brain has been denied has made Macklin stupid, almost childlike. The two scientists propose they can fix this quite easily, and they just need to reverse the treatment they gave him, which would return him to his original state. Both Macklin and his wife refuse this. Macklin wants to live a life without pain, and the thoughts about the universe that would keep him up worrying, late at night. His wife tells the men that she doesn't want to go against her husband's wishes, and if the US government wants to take the pair to court over it, so that Macklin might regain full consciousness and continue with his work on the Pluto project, the court would side in her and her husband's favour. \nThe men leave, defeated. That is until Mitchell wakes up in the middle of the night, and calls Macklin, convincing him that it's in his best interest to come to his lab, so that he might make him better.

After a knock on the door, Mitchell and Ferris invite Macklin inside. They introduce the injection and claim that his headache can be cured forever with this one simple injection. Macklin notices that they have not yet tested this on a human being, but they assert that it worked fine on rats and chimps. They explain their situation to Macklin, which is a lack of time and money. They have the resources to cure one person. However, Macklin is still suspicious of the injection. Mitchell and Ferris assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low enough blood pressure to stop the heart. Along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject. \n\nMacklin’s wife calls and blames them for giving her husband heroin. Being confused, Mitchell and Ferris look at the test animals and realize that the ones with injections are much more calmer and have less energy. They go to see Macklin.

After Mitchell explains that he has the antitoxin to fix him, Carson demands them to give it to Macklin. However, Macklin refuses. He used to be worried all the time, but now he is peaceful. Since he is legally responsible, he can definitely refuse the antitoxin. Thus, they go to Mrs. Macklin, hoping that she will be able to persuade Macklin to take the antitoxin. She also refuses.

His suit of\nhound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his\njacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious\nbank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really\nswing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you\ncome on real cool in the secretary-bit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from\nstaring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair of\nfurry green earmuffs. It was not cold.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color\nbread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beg pardon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and\ndown on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n\"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay?\" He caught\nOrison's look of bewilderment. \"One each, a Franklin and a Grant,\" he\nexplained further. She still looked blank. \"Sister, you gonna work\nin a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's a\nhunnerd-fifty a week, doll.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji,\" Orison said. It was indeed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Crazy!\" Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it with\nathletic vigor. \"You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell\nyou, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around\nthis tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of\nelevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\nto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\nthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\nMr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n\"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\nand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron\nCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,\nnow that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\nhold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\na microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\n\"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\n\"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you\nget done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to\nread. Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a\nsecretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me\nwith the Bank's operation?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that\nthere paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to\nask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,\ncoffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take\ncare of these details now? Or would you—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems\nbest to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's\nmight explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's\nsecretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,\ngirl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket,\nunfolded it to discover the day's\n  <i>\n   Wall Street Journal\n  </i>\n  , and began at\nthe top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,\nnodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said.\n\"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the\none into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then\ntook off upstairs in the elevator.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  By lunchtime Orison had finished the\n  <i>\n   Wall Street Journal\n  </i>\n  and had\nbegun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a\nfantastic novel of some sort, named\n  <i>\n   The Hobbit\n  </i>\n  . Reading this peculiar\nfare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than\never that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her,\nthe front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a\nFederal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a\nmicrophone for an invisible audience.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the\nbook and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was\na new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming\ndown from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with\nbriefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these\ngentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped\naboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his\nheart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment\nof their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny\ninto this curiousest of banks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude.\nGirls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together,\neyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and\nfavored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed,\nfinished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her\nlonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished the book,\nreading rapidly and becoming despite herself engrossed in the saga of\nBilbo Baggins, Hobbit. She switched off the microphone, put on her\nlight coat, and rode downstairs in an elevator filled with earmuffed,\nsilent, hat-clasping gentlemen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a\ndouble Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard\nTaft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of\nthe U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association.\nEarmuffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read into a microphone. A Vice-President\nwith the vocabulary of a racetrack tout. And what goes on in those\nupper floors? Orison stopped in at the restaurant nearest her apartment\nhouse—the Windsor Arms—and ordered a meal and a single Martini. Her\nboss in Washington had told her that this job of hers, spying on Taft\nBank from within, might prove dangerous. Indeed it was, she thought.\nShe was in danger of becoming a solitary drinker.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Home in her apartment, Orison set the notes of her first day's\nobservations in order. Presumably Washington would call tonight for\nher initial report. Item: some of the men at the Bank wore earmuffs,\nseveral didn't. Item: the Vice-President's name was Mr. Wanji:\nOriental? Item: the top eight floors of the Taft Bank Building seemed\nto be off-limits to all personnel not wearing earmuffs. Item: she was\nbeing employed at a very respectable salary to read newsprint and\nnonsense into a microphone. Let Washington make sense of that, she\nthought.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  In a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven\no'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\nof her first day's spying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\nwas set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\nPerhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\nhad her phone tapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\nDo you read me? Over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The room was empty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n  <i>\n   Wall Street Journal\n  </i>\n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Orison finished the\n  <i>\n   Wall Street Journal\n  </i>\n  by early afternoon. A\npage came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of\nyesterday's\n  <i>\n   Congressional Record\n  </i>\n  . She launched into the\n  <i>\n   Record\n  </i>\n  ,\nthinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome\nmadman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. \"You read\nso\n  <i>\n   well\n  </i>\n  , darling,\" someone said across the desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison looked up. \"Oh, hello,\" she said. \"I didn't hear you come up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I walk ever so lightly,\" the woman said, standing hip-shot in front\nof the desk, \"and pounce ever so hard.\" She smiled. Opulent, Orison\nthought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don't like\nher. Can't. Wouldn't if I could. Never cared for cats.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing\nteeth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I'm\nAuga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan't have time to\nvisit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker.\nOne for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks,\" Orison said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I'd like to\ndraw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding—you know, the\nshoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Should\nyou throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your little\neyes scratched out. Word to the wise,\n  <i>\n   n'est-ce pas\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her\n  <i>\n   Wall\nStreet Journal\n  </i>\n  into a club and standing. \"Darling.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here.\nYou could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of\nannoyance. Understand me, darling?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you'd best hurry back to\nyour stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right\noff?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator,\ndisplaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba\nmotion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male,\nstepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed,\nhe stepped up to Orison's desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused\nand shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It's just that ...\nVingt thing....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank\nand Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I'm Kraft Gerding,\nDink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped\neven closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch\nof frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The\nhead, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's\nspike-topped\n  <i>\n   Pickelhauben\n  </i>\n  ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed\nnormal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed—what continental manners these bankers\nhad!—and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up\npaper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and\nsaid, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,\nMiss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing\nbusiness with pleasure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she\nshouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I\ncare. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in\nfinance, and listen to another word.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,\na bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most\ncharming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,\ndear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to\nthe wise....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   N'est-ce pas?\n  </i>\n  \" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here's a word to the\nfoolish. Get lost.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind\nyou. Push a button, will you? And\n  <i>\n   bon voyage\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with\na cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above\nfifth floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.\nSurely, Orison thought, recovering the\n  <i>\n   Wall Street Journal\n  </i>\n  from her\nwastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern\nbank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior\nof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she\nthought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks\nand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she\nfinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits\nupper floors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the\nsudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \"\n  <i>\n   Wanji e-Kal, Datto.\nDink ger-Dink d'summa.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before\nreplying, \"I'm a local girl. Try me in English.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I'm in kinda\nclutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see\nhim, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down.\nWhat now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language\nMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by\ntonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle\nit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,\nshe had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could\nonly fire her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would\nbe here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.\nThe elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her\noff the upstairs floors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the building had a stairway.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to\nseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and\nthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There\nwas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the\nfringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room\nextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,\nits ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were\ngalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.\nOrison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred\nand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by\nstrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with\npink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half\nfull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment\nOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the\nliquid. Then she screamed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from\nthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions\nupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,\nleaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison\nput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the\nstairway door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Into a pair of arms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said.\nOrison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have\nher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder\nGerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he\nsaid. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were\nwe to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against\nher two\n  <i>\n   sumo\n  </i>\n  -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by\nsome quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the\nfloor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted\nall around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of\ncourse, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of\ncalcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within\nminutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of\nthe earmuffed\n  <i>\n   sumo\n  </i>\n  -wrestlers protested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you\nmust tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dink ... Dink!\" Orison shouted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of\ndamsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the\nbank.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you\nacromegalic apes!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Suddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as\nthough struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their\nfaces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly lowering\nhimself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Without\nquestions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms\naround Orison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They can't harm you,\" he said. She turned to press her face against\nhis chest. \"You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn\nyour brain back on. All right, now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" she said, still trembling. \"They were going to throw me to\nthe spiders.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Kraft told you that?\" Dink Gerding released her and turned to the\nkneeling man. \"Stand up, Elder Brother.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft's\njaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt to\nrecover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.\"\nKraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dink\nthrough half-closed eyes. \"No? Then get out of here, all of you.\n  <i>\n   Samma!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, with\nthe merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison,\" Dink said. \"Why did you do\nit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you read the story of Bluebeard?\" Orison asked. She stood close\nto Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. \"I had to see\nwhat it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was\nforbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for\nyou, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you\nthat the escudo green is pale.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless,\" Dink said. \"Now, what\nis this thing you have about spiders?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've always been terrified of them,\" Orison said. \"When I was a little\ngirl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a\nspider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came\nhome and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetite\nfor supper.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Strange,\" Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked\none of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. \"This is no spider,\nOrison,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped\nin the palm of his hand. \"These are Microfabridae, more nearly related\nto shellfish than to spiders,\" he said. \"They're stone-and-metal\neaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.\" He\nextended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature,\nflesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around\nthe bowl of his hand. \"Pretty little fellow, isn't he?\" Dink asked.\n\"Here. You hold him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd rather not,\" she protested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd be happier if you did,\" Dink said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Orison extended her hand as into a furnace. Dink brushed the\nMicrofabridus from his palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like\na legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and\nunfolded it, to hold it over Orison's palm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's like a baby crawdad,\" Orison said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A sort of crustacean,\" Dink agreed. \"We use them in a commercial\nprocess we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off and\nsecret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do they do?\" Orison asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's still a secret,\" Dink said, smiling. \"I can't tell even you\nthat, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's he doing now?\" Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus,\nperched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching\nagainst her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They like gold,\" Dink explained, peering across her shoulder,\ncomfortably close. \"They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as\nchildren are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison.\nWe'd better get you down where you belong.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest\ntank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring.\nIt was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. \"Strange,\nusing crawdads in a bank,\" she said. She stood silent for a moment. \"I\nthought I heard music,\" she said. \"I heard it when I came in. Something\nlike the sighing of wind in winter trees.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing\ntogether while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He\ntook her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these\nlittle workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to\nthe music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness,\nstorm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace\nand harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash\nof breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the\nquiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.\n\"It's an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been\nsinging it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a\nwood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.\n\"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.\n\"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the\nmineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the\nliquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.\n\"They're so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she\nthought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling\nlife. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n \n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "af155caa61514dd9b3bfe0a82a06500f", "response_text": "Orison McCall is applying for a job at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company.

He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,\ncrimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance\nWashington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the\nwire as the scrambler went into operation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys\nare supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this\ndamned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest\nof the afternoon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered\nhum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond—I can't\nwait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing\nme.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got\nsome answers to go with the questions?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind\nthat. This fellow Margrave—General Margrave. Project Officer for the\nhyperwave program—he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I\nblame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret\nproject, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.\nHyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let\nme do it my way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator\ncould be misled.

I need someone to hang!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street\nand turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY\nMUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a\nheavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind\nan ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the\nopposite corner of his mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of\nauthority.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,\nthough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He\ncame to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What\nbrings you back to the boondocks?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a\nvisit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered\nthe discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the\nhigh-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission\nproduced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He\npassed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric\ncircles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these\npoints of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction\npattern—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your\nword for it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this\nsection. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's\nnear here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the\nnews that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says\nis a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken\nto TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord\nintended.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had\nsomething ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there's always Mr. Bram ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a\nhundred years old when I was kid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his\ngroceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what about him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little\ntouched in the head.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine\nsaid. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something\nI've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.\nI never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and\nsometimes he gave us apples.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"I've never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this\ntown is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram\nhas blue eyes and blond hair—or did before it turned white—and he\ntalks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an\nordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.\nBut we never did know where he came from.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long's he lived here in Elsby?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about\nancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She\nwas kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same\nold place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died\nfive years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every\nWednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened\nthen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all\nover again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in\nthe drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around\nwith me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the\nprescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the\nother drug store....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him\nand a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it\non fire.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What was the idea of that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was\npassing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here\nfor six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke\nroutine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back\nin the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day\nthey'll make jail age.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any\ndealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew\nabout Mr. Bram—the young Mr. Bram—and Linda Carroll.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine shook his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired\nby the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in\nher day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I\nremember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.\nSitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to\nthink she was some kind of princess....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,\nfrowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n\neight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties—and that made\nher an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting\nher cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six\nfoot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair—and a stranger to\nboot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local\nbucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny\nabout any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But\nthis was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down\nthere; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,\npractically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy\nshay. And the next day, she was home again—alone. That finished off\nher reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was\nten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was\nalready old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram\nin front of her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears\nand eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.\nMeantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of\ndetector you were going to set up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up\nin my room over at the hotel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely\nrepeating logarithmic sequence, based on—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me\nknow if you want anything. And by the way—\" he winked broadly—\"I\nalways did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front\nteeth.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town\nHall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow\nautumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the\nsteps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,\na hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said\n\"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at\nTremaine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're closed,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the\nBram property changed hands last.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?\nHe dead?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to\nsell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping\nto save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.\nA folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward\nit. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where\na two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a\nline written in faded ink:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter\nSection 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 &amp; cet.)\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the\nnineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to\nthe door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of\ntrouble?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. No trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"\nhe said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be\ndern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess you're right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about\nold Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and\nlights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.\n\"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You—uh—paying anything for information?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway—I can swear to this.\nNobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco\nfacade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a\npaper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The\nolder are there in the shelves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle\nthese old papers carefully.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed\nthrough it, muttering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,\nadjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she\nsaid. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the\ndark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front\npage. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American\nExposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.\nTremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On page four, under a column headed\n  <i>\n   County Notes\n  </i>\n  he saw the name Bram:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,\nnorth of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of\nElsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a\nfew head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has\nbeen a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past\nmonths.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the\nheads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to\nher desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught\nhis eye:\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much\nalarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and\nthunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine\nwoods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of\ntimber and threatened the house before burning itself out along\nthe river.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.\nYou'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in\nwindows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a\ncold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint\nsqueal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward\nof the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped\nshort, stared after the car.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.\nTremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked\nopen the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed\nnorth after the police car.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine\nrounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the\nhighway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.\nThe door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's it to you, mister?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We could be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted\nchewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to\nhim.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike\nbefore handing it to Tremaine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef,\nTremaine?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave\nthe word, Grammond.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out\non me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were\ndoing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it\napart brick by brick in the time—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll\ngo underground.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use\nfor the spade work, that it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching\nout a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling\nall over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs\nthree tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all\nthe answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.\nTell him if he queers this—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back\nover the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia\nmoonshiners.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out\nyour famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine\nhung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of\nScotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat\nand left the hotel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He\nwalked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a\nonce-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its\nwindows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the\nancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button\nbeside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute\nbefore the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned\nface looked at him coolly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss\nCarroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.\nOnly a faint quaver reflected her age—close to eighty, Tremaine\nthought, startled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the\nfurnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a\nstraight chair across the room from him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see\nthat you've amounted to something.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even\nas a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some\ninformation. This is an important matter. May I rely on your\ndiscretion?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have no idea.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May I see it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In the car.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better get it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not a very cozy—\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy\nlounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop\nof greased hair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung\nthe cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong\nwith burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that\nout, Hull?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we\nheard....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did you hear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cops.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who says so?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to\nthe corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all\nnight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called\nme over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get\nthem spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around\nhers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the\nspies was out north of town.

Tremaine asks Jess if he has any idea of a transmitter in this area, however, Jess does not seem really interested in the transmitters as he think drawing is a beer advertisement. Afterwards, Jess tells Tremaine about the old man Bram who seems to have lived in this town forever. He is the mystery man of the town. As a foreigner who no one knows much about, he seems strange. Knowing that Bram has lived on the same property since as long as anyone could remember, he goes to the Municipal Office of Records to check the last time that there was a change of hands on Bram’s property.  \n\nThen Tremaine goes to the Elsby Public Library, checking for the newspapers around the time when Bram bought the property. On his way back to the hotel that he is staying at, he notices Grammond’s men. But Tremaine has told Grammond to keep his men away from this town for now. Apparently, Grammond didn’t listen, Tremaine is afraid that with the police searching around the town, the person they are looking for will sense that something is off, and will hide before they are able to find him/her.\n\nDesiring to learn more about this old man, Jess has also mentioned to Tremaine that Linda Carroll had been with Bram for a while when Carroll was in her twenties, which is a few decades ago. So then Tremaine goes to Carroll’s house hoping to learn more about the mysterious man Bram. Then after he left Carroll’s house, he goes to Bram’s house together with Jess.

Jess says everyone around is bad with technologies, but Mr. Bram is a mystery man, so it could be him.

Tremaine heads towards the Elsby Town Hall, he learns that Bram bought his property in 1901.

A. LOMBINO\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake\n   <br/>\n   a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel\n   <br/>\n   Walsh's madness—murder-madness—when he ordered Major\n   <br/>\n   Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories\n  <br/>\n  November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\n  <br/>\n  U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since\nwe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.\nHe might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as\nI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At\nleast, that's what he told me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\nsomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\nSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of\nit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and\nthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get\nby with gravy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\nhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on\nthe job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his\nfingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then\nadded, \"For a native, that is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the\nway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.\nWhich brought to mind an important point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I\nthought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk\nas if he were waiting for me to cut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so\nhappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just\nwhat's happening on Mars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very\nfar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If\nanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give\nthem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called\nit \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at\nleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never\nbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It\nwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported\nhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium\nthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\nHe still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by\nreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\nany military organization, he outranked me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just Joe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just Joe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\nfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\nlike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\nPersonal habits? Anything?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like\nany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He\ndoes have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on\nthat trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought\nabout Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that\nrevolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started\npushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if\nthe whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took\nover. Swell guy, Walsh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic\nI was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like\na mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere\nI looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd\nnever seen before, and some as bare as cactus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me\nabout. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about\nhim was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have\nbeen stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to\nnormal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance\nbetween us in seconds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Call me Joe,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  going to be a\nsimple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at\nhis use of Terran idiom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a\npocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began\nwondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking\nfor. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately\nupon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him\nanyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a\ndrink first.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where's the Officer's Club?\" I asked the Venusian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can you take me there?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a\nheavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when\nhe dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that\nprotected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable\nbut I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped\nthe native thirty solars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh\nwell, you're new here. We'll let it go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'd\nmeant. Had I tipped him too little?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it\nlooked as hot as hell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to\ncurse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game\nand a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Call me Joe,\" he answered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He caught me off balance. \"What?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe,\" he said again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.\n\"You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about\nMars, would you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like\n  </i>\n  Joe.\n  <i>\n   Among the natives, I mean.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most\ncontemptible....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain's shack?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at\nthe bartender.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How's it going?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a\ngreat gag. Very funny. Very....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who'd just come in asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,\" he said. \"He's\nabout ready to post you as overdue.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Another Joe\n  </i>\n  , I thought.\n  <i>\n   Another damned Joe.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n  <i>\n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n  </i>\n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them—the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just a case of extended\n  <i>\n   idiot\n  </i>\n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How much?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Venusian started to leave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of\nme. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed\nlike a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something\nthat had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I'd be\nback again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set\nfor me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or maybe he didn't expect me to come back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thought hadn't occurred to me before this, and I began to consider\nit seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing\nat the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a\nfew more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with\nSpace II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken\nplace like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too.\nBut what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in\ncommand. If he were transferred, I'd be in charge of Space II, and I\ncould understand how much that would appeal to Walsh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good\npoints against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A\nguy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of\nuranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn't watched,\nwould deliberately do just about anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may\nhave been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a\ngag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall,\nelongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you familiar with the jungle?\" I asked him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Has Joe told you what the payment will be?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When can we leave?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right away, sir. We won't need much really. I've made a list of\nsupplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear\nlight clothing, boots, and a hat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will I need a weapon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. \"Why, what for, sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind,\" I said. \"What's your name, by the way?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was\ndefinitely surprised.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe,\" he said. \"Didn't you know?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\nboots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\nwould have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\nhigh boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\nenjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\npleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\nsee three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\nhis head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\nThen he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\nimpenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\nto another village.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\nhuts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\nto greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\nthe sun like a great silver bullet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What...?\" I started.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\nthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\nstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look\ncheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\njoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\nhappiness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\nwas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel,\n  <i>\n   Major\n  </i>\n  .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\nfinality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd\nbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\npointing the stun gun at my middle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\nhave.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\nsmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\ngoing to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\nit'll rain tomorrow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\nthis. Another of those funny Terran games.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\nshould thank you, really.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\nwhen you decided to cork off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\nnudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\nsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\naudible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\nlittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\nunimportant drama.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\nunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\ngame, the fun?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\nnever any trouble before you took command.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\nsay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\nOr maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\nsavages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\nThe perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the\ncolonel in puzzlement.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "106", "uid": "e0294bdceda64c64aa14173c25a683d8", "response_text": "Major Polk is given orders by his Boss, Colonel Walsh, to go to Venus in search of a man named Joe.

Then, Major begins to realize that maybe Colonel Walsh didn’t want him back since he is the next in line for command. He decides to be more careful. Following the guide, the Major walks from village to village, searching the natives for that particular Joe. The Major and the guide get close and become friend. However, the next village they visit does not have any natives, only Colonel Walsh.

Not in his wildest imaginings had\nhe thought they would actually find what they were looking for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cut the drive!\" he yelled at Queazy. \"I've got it, right on the nose.\nQueazy, my boy, can you imagine it? We're in the dough. Not only that,\nwe're rich! Come here!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy discharged their tremendous inertia into the motive-tubes in\nsuch a manner that the big, powerful ship was moving at the same rate\nas the asteroid below—47.05 miles per second. He came slogging back\nexcitedly, put his eyes to the eyepiece. He gasped, and his big body\nshook with joyful ejaculations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She checks down to the last dimension,\" Bob chortled, working with\nslide-rule and logarithm tables. \"Now all we have to do is find out if\nshe's made of tungsten, iron, quartz crystals, and cinnabar! But there\ncouldn't be two asteroids of that shape anywhere else in the Belt, so\nthis has to be it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He jerked a badly crumpled ethergram from his pocket, smoothed it out,\nand thumbed his nose at the signature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Whee! Mr. Andrew S. Burnside, you owe us five hundred and fifty\nthousand dollars!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy straightened. A slow, likeable smile wreathed his tanned face.\n\"Better take it easy,\" he advised, \"until I land the ship and we use\nthe atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of the\nasteroid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have it your way,\" Bob Parker sang, happily. He threw the ethergram\nto the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy—so\ncalled because his full name was Quentin Zuyler—dropped the ship\nstraight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped it\ntight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, brought\nout two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, with\nstar-powdered infinity spread to all sides.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia,\none of the richest men in the world, still lay on the deck-plates. It\nwas addressed to: Mr. Robert Parker, President Interplanetary Hauling &amp;\nMoving Co., 777 Main Street, Satterfield City, Fontanaland, Mars. The\nethergram read:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Received your advertising literature a week ago. Would like to state\nthat yes I would like an asteroid in my back yard. Must meet following\nspecifications: 506 feet length, long enough for wedding procession;\n98 feet at base, tapering to 10 feet at apex; 9-12 feet thick; topside\nsmooth-plane, underside rough-plane; composed of iron ore, tungsten,\nquartz crystals, and cinnabar. Must be in my back yard before 11:30\nA.M. my time, for important wedding June 2, else order is void. Will\npay $5.00 per ton.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker had received that ethergram three weeks ago. And if The\nInterplanetary Hauling &amp; Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on the\nrocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor &amp; Saylor, a rival firm)\nneither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answering\nethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. It\nwas, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chance\nthere was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worries\nwould be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, using\ntheir mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed like\nan incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions of\nasteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space only\nthree weeks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea had been Bob Parker's originally.\nNow it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the first\nrich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid.\nUnfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in on\nthat brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers—which persons\nBob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would have\nbefore this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants.\nNow that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate to\nget it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might get\nwind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits.\nWhich was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor &amp; Saylor made\nno pretense of being scrupulous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now they scuffed along the smooth-plane topside of the asteroid, the\nmagnets in their shoes keeping them from stepping off into space. They\ncame to the broad base of the asteroid-wedge, walked over the edge and\n\"down\" the twelve-foot thickness. Here they squatted, and Bob Parker\nhappily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface.\nBy the naked eye, they could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar,\nbut he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn't\nuse it. He satisfied himself as to the exterior of the asteroid, and\nthen sent the twin beams deep into its heart. The beams crossed, tore\natoms from molecules, revolved them like an infinitely fine powder. The\nradiations from the sundered molecules traveled back up the beams to\nthe atomic-whirl spectroscope. Bob watched a pointer which moved slowly\nup and up—past tungsten, past iridium, past gold—\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker said, in astonishment, \"Hell! There's something screwy about\nthis business. Look at that point—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer any\nfurther. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred and\nthe lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far as\nhe could inside the \"aquarium\"—the glass helmet, and found himself\nlooking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of the\nasteroid \"below.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ma'am,\" said Bob, blinking, \"did you say something?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automatically\nreached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I said,\" remarked the girl, \"that you should scram off of my asteroid.\nAnd quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already taken\na reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob's nose twitched as he adjusted his glasses, which he wore even\ninside his suit. He couldn't think of anything pertinent to say. He\nknew that he was slowly working up a blush. Mildly speaking, the\ngirl was beautiful, and though only her carefully made-up face was\nvisible—cool blue eyes, masterfully coiffed, upswept, glinting brown\nhair, wilful lips and chin—Bob suspected the rest of her compared\nnicely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her expression darkened as she saw the completely instinctive way he\nwas looking at her and her radioed-voice rapped out, \"Now you two boys\ngo and play somewhere else! Else I'll let the Interplanetary Commission\nknow you've infringed the law. G'bye!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She turned and disappeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob awoke from his trance, shouted desperately, \"Hey! Wait!\n  <i>\n   You!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He and Queazy caught up with her on the side of the asteroid they\nhadn't yet examined. It was a rough plane, completing the rigid\nqualifications Burnside had set down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait a minute,\" Bob Parker begged nervously. \"I want to make some\nconversation, lady. I'm sure you don't understand the conditions—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl turned and drew a gun from a holster. It was a spasticizer,\nand it was three times as big as her gloved hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand conditions better than you do,\" she said. \"You want\nto move this asteroid from its orbit and haul it back to Earth.\nUnfortunately, this is my home, by common law. Come back in a month. I\ndon't expect to be here then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A month!\" Parker burst the word out. He started to sweat, then his\nface became grim. He took two slow steps toward the girl. She blinked\nand lost her composure and unconsciously backed up two steps. About\ntwenty steps away was her small dumbbell-shaped ship, so shiny and\nunscarred that it reflected starlight in highlights from its curved\nsurface. A rich girl's ship, Bob Parker thought angrily. A month would\nbe too late!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said grimly, \"Don't worry. I don't intend to pull any rough stuff.\nI just want you to listen to reason. You've taken a whim to stay on\nan asteroid that doesn't mean anything to you one way or another. But\nto us—to me and Queazy here—it means our business. We got an order\nfor this asteroid. Some screwball millionaire wants it for a backyard\nwedding see? We get five hundred and fifty thousand dollars for it!\nIf we don't take this asteroid to Earth before June 2, we go back to\nSatterfield City and work the rest of our lives in the glass factories.\nDon't we, Queazy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy said simply, \"That's right, miss. We're in a spot. I assure you\nwe didn't expect to find someone living here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl holstered her spasticizer, but her completely inhospitable\nexpression did not change. She put her hands on the bulging hips of her\nspace-suit. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Now I understand the conditions. Now we\nboth understand each other. G'bye again. I'm staying here and—\" she\nsmiled sweetly \"—it may interest you to know that if I let you have\nthe asteroid you'll save your business, but I'll meet a fate worse than\ndeath! So that's that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob recognized finality when he saw it. \"Come on, Queazy,\" he said\nfuming. \"Let this brat have her way. But if I ever run across her\nwithout a space-suit on I'm going to give her the licking of her life,\nright where it'll do the most good!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned angrily, but Queazy grabbed his arm, his mouth falling open.\nHe pointed off into space, beyond the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that?\" he whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's wha—\n  <i>\n   Oh!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker's stomach caved in. A few hundred feet away, floating\ngently toward the asteroid, came another ship—a ship a trifle bigger\nthan their own. The girl turned, too. They heard her gasp. In another\nsecond, Bob was standing next to her. He turned the audio-switch to his\nheadset off, and spoke to the girl by putting his helmet against hers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen to me, miss,\" he snapped earnestly, when she tried to draw\naway. \"Don't talk by radio. That ship belongs to the Saylor brothers!\nOh, Lord, that this should happen! Somewhere along the line, we've been\ndouble-crossed. Those boys are after this asteroid too, and they won't\nhesitate to pull any rough stuff. We're in this together, understand?\nWe got to back each other up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl nodded dumbly. Suddenly she seemed to be frightened.\n\"It's—it's very important that this—this asteroid stay right where it\nis,\" she said huskily. \"What—what will they do?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue\nsparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic\nclamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and\nfive men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood\nsurveying the three who faced them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their\ndarkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you\nthink of this situation Billy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his\nheels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have\nto take steps.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling\nlaughter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an\nethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled—and his smile remained fixed,\ndangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came\nabreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave\nback a step, as he saw their intentions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll\nreport you to the Interplanetary Commission!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of\nthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of\nthe girl's spasticizer—a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained\nchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at\nQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He\nhurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid\nand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his\nhand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked\nthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something\ncrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar\nplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,\nand his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,\nbefore the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete\ndarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage—then a scream of pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,\nhe didn't care. Then—lights out.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker came to, the emptiness of remote starlight in his face. He\nopened his eyes. He was slowly revolving on an axis. Sometimes the Sun\nswept across his line of vision. A cold hammering began at the base of\nhis skull, a sensation similar to that of being buried alive. There was\nno asteroid, no girl, no Queazy. He was alone in the vastness of space.\nAlone in a space-suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Queazy!\" he whispered. \"Queazy! I'm running out of air!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no answer from Queazy. With sick eyes, Bob studied the\noxygen indicator. There was only five pounds pressure. Five pounds!\nThat meant he had been floating around out here—how long? Days at\nleast—maybe weeks! It was evident that somebody had given him a dose\nof spastic rays, enough to screw up every muscle in his body to the\nsnapping point, putting him in such a condition of suspended animation\nthat his oxygen needs were small. He closed his eyes, trying to fight\nagainst panic. He was glad he couldn't see any part of his body. He was\nprobably scrawny. And he was hungry!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll starve,\" he thought. \"Or suffocate to death first!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He couldn't keep himself from taking in great gulps of air. Minutes,\nthen hours passed. He was breathing abnormally, and there wasn't enough\nair in the first place. He pleaded continually for Queazy, hoping\nthat somehow Queazy could help, when probably Queazy was in the same\ncondition. He ripped out wild curses directed at the Saylor brothers.\nMurderers, both of them! Up until this time, he had merely thought of\nthem as business rivals. If he ever got out of this—\n </p>\n <p>\n  He groaned. He never would get out of it! After another hour, he was\ngasping weakly, and yellow spots danced in his eyes. He called Queazy's\nname once more, knowing that was the last time he would have strength\nto call it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And this time the headset spoke back!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker made a gurgling sound. A voice came again, washed with\nstatic, far away, burbling, but excited. Bob made a rattling sound in\nhis throat. Then his eyes started to close, but he imagined that he saw\na ship, shiny and small, driving toward him, growing in size against\nthe backdrop of the Milky Way. He relapsed, a terrific buzzing in his\nears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He did not lose consciousness. He heard voices, Queazy's and the\ngirl's, whoever she was. Somebody grabbed hold of his foot. His\n\"aquarium\" was unbuckled and good air washed over his streaming face.\nThe sudden rush of oxygen to his brain dizzied him. Then he was lying\non a bunk, and gradually the world beyond his sick body focussed in his\nclearing eyes and he knew he was alive—and going to stay that way, for\nawhile anyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks, Queazy,\" he said huskily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy was bending over him, his anxiety clearing away from his\nsuddenly brightening face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't thank me,\" he whispered. \"We'd have both been goners if it\nhadn't been for her. The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed like\nus, and when she woke up she was on a slow orbit around her ship.\nShe unstrapped her holster and threw it away from her and it gave\nher enough reaction to reach the ship. She got inside and used the\ndirection-finder on the telaudio and located me first. The Saylors\nscattered us far and wide.\" Queazy's broad, normally good-humored face\ntwisted blackly. \"The so and so's didn't care if we lived or died.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob saw the girl now, standing a little behind Queazy, looking down at\nhim curiously, but unhappily. Her space-suit was off. She was wearing\nlightly striped blue slacks and blue silk blouse and she had a paper\nflower in her hair. Something in Bob's stomach caved in as his eyes\nwidened on her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl said glumly, \"I guess you men won't much care for me when you\nfind out who I am and what I've done. I'm Starre Lowenthal—Andrew S.\nBurnside's granddaughter!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob came slowly to his feet, and matched Queazy's slowly growing anger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Say that again?\" he snapped. \"This is some kind of dirty trick you and\nyour grandfather cooked up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" she exclaimed. \"No. My grandfather didn't even know there was an\nasteroid like this. But I did, long before he ordered it from you—or\nfrom the Saylor brothers. You see—well, my granddad's about the\nstubbornest old hoot-owl in this universe! He's always had his way, and\nwhen people stand in his way, that's just a challenge to him. He's been\nbadgering me for years to marry Mac, and so has Mac—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who's Mac?\" Queazy demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My fiancé, I guess,\" she said helplessly. \"He's one of my granddad's\nprotégés. Granddad's always financing some likely young man and giving\nhim a start in life. Mac has become pretty famous for his Mercurian\nwater-colors—he's an artist. Well, I couldn't hold out any longer.\nIf you knew my grandfather, you'd know how absolutely\n  <i>\n   impossible\n  </i>\n  it\nis to go against him when he's got his mind set! I was just a mass of\nnerves. So I decided to trick him and I came out to the asteroid belt\nand picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could take\nplace on it. I took the measurements and the composition, then I told\nmy grandfather I'd marry Mac if the wedding was in the back yard on top\nof an asteroid with those measurements and made of iron ore, tungsten,\nand so forth. He agreed so fast he scared me, and just to make sure\nthat if somebody\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  find the asteroid in time they wouldn't be able\nto get it back to Earth, I came out here and decided to live here.\nAsteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them,\nby common law.... So I had everything figured out—except,\" she added\nbitterly, \"the Saylor brothers! I guess Granddad wanted to make sure\nthe asteroid was delivered, so he gave the order to several companies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob swore under his breath. He went reeling across to a port, and was\ngratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floating\nonly a few hundred feet away. He swung around, looked at Queazy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How long were we floating around out there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us a\nstiff shot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Ouch!\n  </i>\n  \" Bob groaned. Then he looked at Starre Lowenthal with\ndetermination. \"Miss, pardon me if I say that this deal you and your\ngranddad cooked up is plain screwy! With us on the butt end. But I'm\ngoing to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylor\nbrothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship and\nours both travel on the HH drive—inertia-less. But the asteroid has\nplenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by a\nlong, spiraling orbit. We can go direct and probably catch up with them\na few hundred thousand miles this side of Earth. And we can have a\nfling at getting the asteroid back!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her eyes sparkled. \"You mean—\" she cried. Then her attractive face\nfell. \"Oh,\" she said. \"\n  <i>\n   Oh!\n  </i>\n  And when you get it back, you'll land it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" Bob said grimly. \"We're in business. For us, it's a\nmatter of survival. If the by-product of delivering the asteroid is\nyour marriage—sorry! But until we do get the asteroid back, we three\ncan work as a team if you're willing. We'll fight the other problem out\nlater. Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled tremulously. \"Okay, I guess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy looked from one to another of them. He waved his hand scornfully\nat Bob. \"You're plain nuts,\" he complained. \"How do you propose to go\nabout convincing the Saylor brothers they ought to let us have the\nasteroid back? Remember, commercial ships aren't allowed to carry\nlong-range weapons. And we couldn't ram the Saylor brothers' ship—not\nwithout damaging our own ship just as much. Go ahead and answer that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob looked at Queazy dismally. \"The old balance-wheel,\" he groaned at\nStarre. \"He's always pulling me up short when I go off half-cocked. All\nI know is, that maybe we'll get a good idea as we go along. In the\nmeantime, Starre—ahem—none of us has eaten in three weeks...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Starre got the idea. She smiled dazzlingly and vanished toward the\ngalley.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after five\ndays out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth;\nprobably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn't\nattach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailed\nastern, attached by a long cable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifth\nday Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and she\ngently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Even\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder,\nBob. That switch is for the—ah—the anathern tube, you told me. Right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right,\" he said unsteadily. \"Anyway, Starre, as I was saying, this\nship operates according to the reverse Fitzgerald Contraction Formula.\nAll moving bodies contract in the line of motion. What Holloway\nand Hammond did was to reverse that universal law. They caused the\ncontraction first—motion had to follow! The gravitonic field affects\nevery atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We could\ngo from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second just\nlike that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He snapped his fingers. \"No acceleration effects. This type of ship,\nnecessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move in\nany direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motion\nat—Oh, hell!\" Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making him\nshake. He took her hand. \"Starre,\" he said desperately, \"I've got to\ntell you something—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She jerked her hand away. \"No,\" she exclaimed in an almost frightened\nvoice. \"You can't tell me. There's—there's Mac,\" she finished,\nfaltering. \"The asteroid—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  to marry him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her eyes filled with tears. \"I have to live up to the bargain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And ruin your whole life,\" he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back to\nthe control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely to\nthe lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell ship\ntrailing astern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's your ship, Starre.\" He jabbed his finger at it. \"I've got a\nfeeling—and I can't put the thought into concrete words—that somehow\nthe whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back lies\nthere. But how?\n  <i>\n   How?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it was\nattached around her ship's narrow midsection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She shook her head helplessly. \"It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A yo-yo?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, a yo-yo. That's all.\" She was belligerent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A\n  <i>\n   yo-yo\n  </i>\n  !\" Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, he\ngot out of the chair so fast. \"Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He disappeared from the room. \"Queazy!\" he shouted. \"\n  <i>\n   Queazy, I've got\nit!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,\nfastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's\nnarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to\ntwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and\nreinforced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob\nParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of\ncosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into\nstrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the\nend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy\nsnapped his fingers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the\nSaylor brothers are where we calculated!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had\ndiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid\non their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the\nMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to\nthe still bigger asteroid—inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred\nthousand miles from Earth!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within\nnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was\nspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere\nvaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship\nwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant\nsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then\nsent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten\nmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the\n\"yo-yo.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,\nscornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm\nthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,\nfor Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero—and Starre Lowenthal's\nlittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!\n </p>\n <p>\n  It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid\nlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a\nfantastic spinning cannon ball.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's going to hit!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship\nreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of\ncompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back\nup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuver\nfor the \"yo-yo\" could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It was\nticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used\nexactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of\nthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in\nhis glove—namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost\nexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid\ndividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released\nagain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor\nbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.\nBut by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with\nbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid\nbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for\nthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing\nit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came\nspinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and\nagain the \"yo-yo\" snapped out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And this time—collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the\nSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the\nhand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to\nthe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had\nreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This\ntime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.\nBob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish\ncommunication.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the\ntelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in\nthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared.\n\"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our\nstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   If\n  </i>\n  you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless\nyou release the asteroid.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll see you in Hades first!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at\nzero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a\ndoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size\nwith a strangled yell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in\nsuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as\nheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling\nprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it was\napparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,\ntheir ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space for\na second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons from\nits still-intact jets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The battle was won!\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "386d46cd588944c0b01e5474b324d330", "response_text": "Bob Parker, the President of Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., sells asteroids to wealthy people on earth.

Parker explains why the asteroid is so important to them, and the girl explains that if they take it, she will meet a fate worse than death. Then suddenly, the Saylors’ ship comes into view and lands. Billy and Wally Saylor alight along with three other men, threatening Parker. So Parker tells them that he has an ethergram from Mr. Burnsides ordering this specific asteroid, but Wally announces that they also have the order. Bob grabs the girl’s spasticizer while Queazy grabs Billy Saylor and hurls him into space. But Wally shoots the spasticizer out of Bob’s hand, and someone hits Bob hard and knocks him out.\n\tWhen Bob regains consciousness, he is almost out of oxygen. He calls out for Queazy with his last breath, and Queazy responds and brings the ship to pick him up. The girl had rescued Queazy. She introduces herself as Starre Lowenthal, Mr. Burnside’s granddaughter. Her grandfather wants her to marry Mac andwouldn’tt take no for an answer, so finally Starre told him she would marry Mac if he could find an asteroid with specific dimensions and containing the minerals she specified. Bob knows the way the Saylors will have to take the asteroid into Earth’s orbit and knows they can catch up to them. He tells Starre they have to do that to say the business, but they will work out her problem, too. \n\tAfter five days, Bob is in love with Starre, and she knows it. He starts to tell her, but she stops him because of Mac and the bargain she has to live up to. Bob says he thinks her ship is the solution, and she says it’s just a big yo-yo. As Bob thinks about this, he devises a way to use her ship as a yo-yo to attack the Saylors’ ship. They catch up to the Saylors and attack them with Starre’s ship until the Saylors release the asteroid and fly away.\n"}]}, {"question_text": "What role do the Saylor brothers play in the story?", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "386d46cd588944c0b01e5474b324d330", "response_text": "The Saylor brothers, Wally and Billy, are Bob Parker’s enemies. Bob was the first person with the unique idea to sell asteroids to wealthy people on earth, and his business would have been very successful if the Saylor brothers did not poach his idea and begin stealing his clients. Bob worries about the Saylor brothers from the beginning of the story, and he acknowledges that they do not always play by the rules. If Wally and Billy can make a buck by inconveniencing or cheating someone else, they will do it. The brothers are not only intimidating in terms of their business prowess; they are also described as giant when compared to Bob. \n\nQueasy and Bob have a legitimate order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and they have no idea that the Saylor brothers have received the same order. Yet, they still worry that somehow, someway, their enemies will hear about the potential to make half a million dollars and try to steal their opportunity out from under them. Within moments of setting eyes on their spaceship, Bob tells Starre that they have to fight the Saylor brothers together. He doesn’t know her at all, and she actually just pulled a gun on him, but he so deeply mistrusts Wally and Billy that it’s worth it to take a chance on Starre.\n\nOf course, Bob turns out to be right. The second the Saylor brothers get a chance to potentially kill Bob, Queazy, and Starre, they take it. Bob floats in space, unconscious, for several weeks before Starre eventually finds Queazy and Bob, and they give him oxygen and food. Bob is truly close to death before his friends save him in the knick of time, and the Saylor brothers would be perfectly fine with that outcome. \n\nWally and Billy give Bob all the motivation in the world to try and steal the asteroid back, and Bob is determined to catch up with his rivals and make it work somehow. When he comes up with his yo-yo idea using Starre’s ship, he shows zero empathy for the Saylor brothers. During his attempts to retrieve the rock, he seriously damages the brothers’ ship, and they have the gall to call him and attempt to make him feel guilty about their desperate state. Bob, however, cannot be swayed. He knows that he found the asteroid first and that the brothers purposefully cast him out into space to die.

And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing\nfear—a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an\nevil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,\nwere over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and\nlaboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after\nspawning its first-born.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class\nof the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   first\n  </i>\n  graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,\nbecause we were the\n  <i>\n   first\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach\nof faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New\nMexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and\ngrandparents and kid brothers and sisters—the people who a short time\nago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken\nwistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had\nnever really existed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us\nwith pride in their eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked\nhard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.\nThey're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately\nneed. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land\nthat will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most\nimportant of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up\nat them and feel humility—for mankind needs humility.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on\nMars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and\nwho had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders\nand his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth\nand skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,\nfor I was thinking:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   He's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the\nothers alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the\nfirst!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't\nsee 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I blinked. \"Who?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My folks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in\na strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those\n\"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie\nTaggart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a\nveteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years\nago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the\n  <i>\n   Lunar\nLady\n  </i>\n  , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White\nSands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island\nSpaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like\nme until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I\nremembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It\nwasn't surprising. The\n  <i>\n   Lunar Lady\n  </i>\n  was in White Sands now, but\nliberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   It doesn't matter\n  </i>\n  , I told myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a\ngarden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a\ntenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that\nhe was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at\nthe Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was\nmighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only\nhalf as big.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we\nwere gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw\nthe stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each\nlike a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by\nthe sons of Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of\ncivilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and\na hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,\nbabbling wave.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining\nlike a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear\nrows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and\nold, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that\nit was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate\ntonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as\ngood spacemen should!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,\nwalking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm\nwith some silent melody.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And you, Laura, were with him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity\nof your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a\ngolden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes\nof a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a\ngentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for\nthe past year.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an\nintroduction of Charlie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old\nStardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie\nscorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a\nshiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.\nHis tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the\nresult of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so\naccustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I\nknew, would find them ugly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to\nmeet you, Charlie. Just think—one of Everson's men, one of the first\nto reach the Moon!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the\nweekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're\nplanning to see the town tonight.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their\nown plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.\nCharlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the\nMoon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew\nthat he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian\nfizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'd really like to come,\" I said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  On our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was\na tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor\nshould look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ben,\" he called, \"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two\nmonths to decide.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben?\nDid he make you an offer?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching\nastrogation. What a life\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  would be! Imagine standing in a\nclassroom for forty years when I've got the chance to—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you've got the\nchance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you\nwant, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to\nunderstand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That's what Mickey used\nto want.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Used\n  </i>\n  to want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You bit your lip, not answering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did she mean, Mickey?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben.\nWe've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty\nuniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If\nyou're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or\nanother gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to\nsay, Mickey?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor\nof White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It's not\nso exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my\nknees with the blast of a jet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It doesn't change anything, Ben—right now, I mean. We can still have\na good weekend.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to\nreach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the\n'copter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.\nThey were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,\ndeep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was\ncool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional\nvideo, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or\nhousework.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a\nshower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit\nMars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.\nSkipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,\nthe medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid\nin your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.\nHell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,\nto watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally\nstreaked up from White Sands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:\n\"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's\nsort of funny.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those\ndays, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a\nspaceman then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie\ndoesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as\nI know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew\nsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were\nflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the\nfeeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,\nLaura?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be\nthinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I could never hate you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It—it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you\nwant to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were\nkids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I\ndreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I\nlived for months, just thinking about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,\nand the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I\nrealized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting\nbefore you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think\nmaybe I haven't grown up yet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,\nto see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it\nworth the things you'd have to give up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up\n  <i>\n   what\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on\nthe stars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that\nI'd never noticed before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You can go into space\n  </i>\n  , I thought,\n  <i>\n   and try to do as much living in\nten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died\nin a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie\nburied in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like\nCharlie—a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally\nalone, never finding a home.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth\nin cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with\na wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow\nold, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who\nfill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous\ndust.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense—a lot of\nsense.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his\nscarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,\ntight coughs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I'm\nleavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought\nmaybe you'd like to have 'em.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh,\nit's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years.\nThat's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.\nSome of these days, I won't be so lucky.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to laugh. \"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I'm\ngonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell\nyou what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the\n  <i>\n   Space Rat\n  </i>\n  , just\noff Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a\nlook inside. I'll probably be there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need's some Martian\nclimate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered,\ntoo, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were\ndrugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about\ngoing to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When will you be back?\" you asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a\ncouple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill\nthe doubt worming through my brain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was\ngone.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  That afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's\nroom than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids\ntreasure—pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy,\nbooks, a home-made video.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.\nI could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched\ntheir children grow to adulthood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of\nthem drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it\nhad been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and\nroutines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,\nI hadn't realized I was different.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   My folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd\nhave lived the kind of life a kid should live.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mickey noticed my frown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just\nnot like you and Charlie, I guess. I—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the\n  <i>\n   Odyssey\n  </i>\n  , the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,\ntoo, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than\nteaching. I want to be in deep space.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy\nEarth life while you can. Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted\nsomeone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of\ncourage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the\nflecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever\nso slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as\nmuch as I loved the stars.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure,\nI'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Forty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the\nlittle things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying\ndown to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to\nteach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon\nand the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and\npromise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One morning I thought,\n  <i>\n   Why must I make a choice? Why can't I have both\nyou and the stars? Would that be asking too much?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  All day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I\nwant you to be my wife.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face\nflushed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then you murmured, \"I—I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me\nto marry a spaceman or a teacher?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see,\nBen? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for\n  <i>\n   maybe\n  </i>\n  two months,\n  <i>\n   maybe\n  </i>\n  two\nyears. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty—and I'd have what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn't\nhave to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,\nthen teach.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't\nyou want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears\nglittering in your eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened\non the\n  <i>\n   Cyclops\n  </i>\n  . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was\nflooded with radiation—just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The\nmen had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it\nwas—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me\nsleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You've got to decide now\n  </i>\n  , I told myself.\n  <i>\n   You can't stay here. You've\ngot to make a choice.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The teaching job was still open. The spot on the\n  <i>\n   Odyssey\n  </i>\n  was still\nopen—and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the\nway to Pluto.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a\nhome and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Or you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a\nline in a history book.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \"Get the hell out\nof there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get\nout there on the\n  <i>\n   Odyssey\n  </i>\n  where you belong. We got a date on Mars,\nremember? At the\n  <i>\n   Space Rat\n  </i>\n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand\nCanal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That's what he'd say.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh God,\" I moaned, \"what shall I do?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Next morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and\nbrought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who\ncould be sending me a message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,\nautomatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to\ninform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word\n\"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by\ncourtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stood staring at the cylinder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charles Taggart was dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!\nThe audiogram had lied!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of\nCharles ...\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken\nvoice droned on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You ran to it, shut it off. \"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I\nremembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.\nThe metallic words had told the truth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at\nCharlie's faded tin box.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions—a few wrinkled\nphotos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,\na gold service medal from the Moon Patrol.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.\nIt was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters\ninstead of children, a medal instead of a home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   It'd be a great future\n  </i>\n  , I thought.\n  <i>\n   You'd dream of sitting in a dingy\nstone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,\nstinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls\nwith dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first\nsign of lung-rot.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  To hell with it!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I accepted that job teaching.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A wedding ring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman—his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know—that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind—but that doesn't matter now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do you know\n  <i>\n   why\n  </i>\n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n  <i>\n   sure\n  </i>\n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n  <i>\n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n  </i>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep—at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n  <i>\n   Space Rat\n  </i>\n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have two wedding rings with me—his wife's ring and yours.\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "1", "uid": "85e20d36291f4c3eb3be04fdbf2fdf4b", "response_text": "After studying for six years, Ben sits at his U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight graduation.

Charlie only has 24 hours to spend with Ben before he has to report back for duty, and although he wants to have some drinks with Ben alone, Laura invites them both over, and Ben can’t help but say yes.\n\nMoments later, Dean Dawson reminds Ben about an offer to teach at the Academy. Mickey takes this opportunity to admit to Ben that he will be working as a Supervisor at White Sands Port. Ben is disappointed to hear that Mickey has chosen to live a boring life, but Mickey insists that he does not want to die in his 30s. \n\nAfter dinner at Mickey’s house, Laura and Ben take a walk together. Laura asks about Charlie’s life before he was a spaceman, but Ben doesn’t have answers for her. He doesn’t know anything about Charlie’s past. Ben looks at Laura and realizes that she has feelings for him, too. When she suggests that a career in deep space may not be worth what Ben would be leaving behind, Ben finds himself at a crossroads. Should he live his dream  or should he settle down with the woman he loves and live an ordinary life?\n\nThe next morning, Charlie gives Ben an old tin with souvenirs inside, and then tells him to meet him at the Space Rat, a little cafe on Mars, when he gets there. Ben still hasn’t chosen a career path and decides to stay with Mickey and Laura and their family until he does. He experiences forty days of happiness with his love, Laura, and forty nights of indecision about which career to choose. Ben asks Laura to marry him, but she says she can’t unless he decides to stay on earth. \n\nThe next day, Ben receives a message informing him that Charlie has died from lung-rot, a disease he got in space. When Ben looks in Charlie’s tin and finds useless trinkets, he decides  to take the teaching job so that he does not live a similarly meaningless life. However, hours later, he looks in the tin again and finds a wedding ring. Ben surmises that Charlie wanted to tell him to take the chance on space, and he believes it’s the right decision to make. He can’t live his life without knowing what the stars look like, even if that means he can’t have Laura too. \n"}, {"worker_id": "6", "uid": "135f12f8d4f047789db372879fa69d6c", "response_text": "Spacemen Die at Home is a story in the form of a letter written from Ben to Laura, explaining his decision to leave her behind on Earth. It all begins in June of 1965 in New Mexico when the first class of the U.S. Academy of Interplentary Flight is finally graduating after six years. These 25 students were trained to take on interplanetary flight and space exploration, so they can continue to discover the outer planets. Robert Chandler gave a speech detailing why these brave men were so important to modern society, as women were not allowed to become space explorers. Mickey and Ben, graduates and friends, sat next to each other during the ceremony. Mickey struggles to find his family in the crowd, and Ben reveals that he was orphaned after his parents died in a rocket crash. A spaceman named Charlie Taggart (Stardust Charlie) raised him instead. He was one of the oldest spacemen ever, having travelled for nearly 25 years, and was the Chief Jetman on the Lunar Lady. \nAfter the ceremony, Ben runs into Charlie and sees how much he’s aged in just a year. He looks ill and drugged, but he still asks Ben to celebrate with him. Before Ben can respond, Mickey and his sister Laura came up to him. He is instantly attracted to her and feels a connection. Ben was supposed to spend the weekend with Mickey and his family, but now that Charlie’s in town he feels conflicted. Both Ben and Charlie decide to join them, despite Charlie not being a family man. Dean Dawson, an academy professor, approaches Ben and reminds him of his job offer at the Academy. Ben turns him down laughing, until Mickey reveals that he is not going to space anymore. Instead, he’ll be the Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Sport. After an awkward dinner together, Laura and Ben went stargazing and spoke of Charlie and the draw of space. Laura hints at loving Ben, but doesn’t say it outright. Charlie left the next day, but left Ben some of his possessions. He knows he hasn’t got much time in this universe, but he goes back to Mars anyways. \nWith several job options to choose from, Ben decides to stay at Mickey’s house for the timebeing. He stays for 40 days and nights, spending much of his time with Laura. He asked Laura to marry him, but she says she’d only marry him if he were a teacher, not a spaceman. Ben was faced with a serious conundrum. The next day he received word that Charlges Taggart died of lung-rot, and Ben broke down. Ben sifted through Charlie’s possessions and decided to take on a the teaching gig for Dawson. However, after looking through the box again, he found a wedding ring.

S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, looking at out at the audience for their guests. Mickey is cheerful and generally accepts the world with a smile. Ben’s invited guest, Charlie Taggart, is a pioneering spaceman of 25 years who he thinks of as a parental figure since his parents died in a strato-jet crash when he was four. Ben and Mickey both spot their guests, and there is a contrasting moment between Ben’s orphaned upbringing and Mickey’s family.\nCharlie looks different from the other guests, with scars on his face, and a missing button on his suit - known for doing things his own way. Charlie is a veteran of the explorer Everson's first trip to the Moon, and he had spent his life in space. Mickey introduces Ben to his sister, Laura, after the ceremony. Since Mickey has invited Ben to spend the weekend with them, Laura goes a step further to also invite Charlie, which they both accept. Charlie leaves after one night, gifting Ben a tin box of “souvenirs” from his life, foreshadowing his imminent passing.\nAlthough Ben and Mickey both graduated from the school of interplanetary flight, they have both been offered terrestrial jobs. Ben was offered a job teaching Astrogation at the Academy by Dean Dawson. No doubt very prestigious, but Ben dreams of being the first to visit new planets with Mickey. Mickey awkwardly reveals he had a change of heart, citing that spacemen have short lives because of the demands and danger. Mickey was offered a Cargo Supervisor role at the White Sands Port that he accepted because he will “live a lot longer” there.\nBen is deeply uncertain about his future, accepting Mickey’s offer to stay until he figures it out. During the forty days and forty nights he spends with them he falls in love with Laura and contemplates a family life on Earth with her - even proposing marriage to her - but his desire to be a spaceman remains a barrier to them being together. After Ben learns of Charlie’s death (at “home” on Mars), he remembers the box Charlie gave him. At first he thinks it’s pitiful that there are trinkets in place of the family Charlie might have had on Earth, and makes a decision to take the teaching job and remain on Earth in a safe life with Laura. \nProcessing the contents of the box further, seeing a wedding ring Charlie left for the marriage he couldn’t have due to his life in space, Ben is inspired to again chase his dream in space.

Ben and his friend Mickey looked around for the one person Ben had invited: Charlie Taggart, aka \"Spaceman Charlie\". They spotted him, and Ben was relieved; the three of them went out afterwards to celebrate along with Mickey's sister, Laura. Ben explained that he'd been offered a teaching job at The Academy but wanted to join an exploratory crew. After getting to the helicopter, Ben eventually met Laura and Charlie's parents--simple people who were happy to live on Earth and not be going anywhere any time soon. Charlie did his best to interact with these new people, even though he told some disturbing stories. Laura and Ben headed to the terrace to look for rockets and talked about Charlie; Laura had a lot of questions about his past. They shared a quiet moment, appreciating each other, before Laura made a comment about the desire to go to the stars might be a disappointment: if they weren't what they seemed, maybe they would never be enough. She asked Ben if he really wanted to give up everything he could have, making Ben sad. The next morning, Charlie returned to work and left a box of belongings with Ben; it was only then when Ben became worried about the coughing he'd noticed over the past day, and his glassy eyes and stiff movements. Before they could talk, Charlie was gone. Later, in Mickey's room, Ben reflected on how his childhood was different from that of other children, after his parents died in a rocket crash. It was after this that he realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to stay or to go, and agreed to stay with Mickey's family until he made a decision about what to do. He spent most of the time with Laura, and after forty days of this he proposed to her, prompting her to ask what he wanted to do for his job. She didn't want to marry someone who would be absent, or someone in such a dangerous profession, but would feel better if he stayed and worked as a teacher, because she loved him too.  It was the next day that Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. Shocked, he looked through the box of belongings that Charlie had left him, and after seeing what little Charlie had left behind in terms of meaningful connections, he called The Academy to accept the teaching job. In the end, though, Ben recognized that he would never be happy without trying to explore the stars, so he tells Laura he will not be around when she wakes up because he has to see what's out there, and takes Laura's wedding ring and that of Charlie's wife with him, as mementos.

As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and see\nand smell them with ease.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwise\nin front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The aliens\ncame in every shape and form, in all colors and textures—and all of\nthem eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarre\nbeings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the old\nexhibitionist urge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Send them in one at a time,\" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the\noffice, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to\nbegin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the official\nTerran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people were\naccustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV\nand referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals\nhappy wherever I go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim\nsign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS! We had\nsaturated MacTavish IV with our promotional poop for a month preceding\narrival. Stuff like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Want to visit Earth—see the Galaxy's most glittering and exclusive\nworld? Want to draw good pay, work short hours, experience the thrills\nof show business on romantic Terra? If you are a non-terrestrial,\nthere may be a place for you in the Corrigan Institute of\nMorphological Science. No freaks wanted—normal beings only. J. F.\nCorrigan will hold interviews in person on Ghryne from Thirdday to\nFifthday of Tenmonth. His last visit to the Caledonia Cluster until\n2937, so don't miss your chance! Hurry! A life of wonder and riches\ncan be yours!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Broadsides like that, distributed wholesale in half a thousand\nlanguages, always bring them running. And the Corrigan Institute really\npacks in the crowds back on Earth. Why not? It's the best of its kind,\nthe only really decent place where Earthmen can get a gander at the\nother species of the universe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The office buzzer sounded. Auchinleck said unctuously, \"The first\napplicant is ready to see you, sir.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Send him, her or it in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on\nnervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a\nbig basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and\nfive double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body.\nThere was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones,\none above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  His voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. \"You are Mr. Corrigan?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right.\" I reached for a data blank. \"Before we begin, I'll need\ncertain information about—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am a being of Regulus II,\" came the grave, booming reply, even\nbefore I had picked up the blank. \"I need no special care and I am not\na fugitive from the law of any world.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick\ncough. \"Let me have that again, please?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands for\nRaymond.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course, that's not the name you were born with.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation,\nremaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of\nan apologetic smile. \"My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and\nshall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained.\n\"You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You'll pay\nfor my services, transportation and expenses. I'll be required to\nremain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the pay will be—ah—$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses and\ntransportation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping\non one side, two on the other. \"Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I\naccept the terms!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were\nsigning this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into\nthe other office to sign him up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show;\nthe last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him\ndidn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien\nwho goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker\nwould work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get\nto Earth. My conscience won't let me really\n  <i>\n   exploit\n  </i>\n  a being, but I\ndon't believe in throwing money away, either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit\nhas all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few\ndecades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was\nfollowed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet,\nfour feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple\nof his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being\nso plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at\nanything short of top rate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a\nhandout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supply\nof, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it\na try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even get\nthe handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the\nCaledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had\nfigured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into\nthe successful proprietor of Corrigan's Institute, after some years\nas an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in\n2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial\nbeings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down,\na non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a\nscientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That's what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is,\nof course. A zoo. But we don't go out and hunt for our specimens; we\nadvertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth\nonce in his lifetime, and there's only one way he can do it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We don't keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens\nbefore this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms.\nMy goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I\nreach that, I'll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new\nspecimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids,\nfifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no\nless than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a\nGhrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some\n400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn't see\nhow we could take one on. They're gentle and likable beings, but their\nupkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any\nold kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One more specimen before lunch,\" I told Stebbins, \"to make it an even\ndozen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me queerly and nodded. A being entered. I took a long\nclose look at the life-form when it came in, and after that I took\nanother one. I wondered what kind of stunt was being pulled. So far as\nI could tell, the being was quite plainly nothing but an Earthman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat down facing me without being asked and crossed his legs. He was\ntall and extremely thin, with pale blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, and\nthough he was clean and reasonably well dressed, he had a shabby look\nabout him. He said, in level Terran accents, \"I'm looking for a job\nwith your outfit, Corrigan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's been a mistake. We're interested in non-terrestrials only.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm a non-terrestrial. My name is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Wazzenazz\nXIII.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I don't mind conning the public from time to time, but I draw the line\nat getting bilked myself. \"Look, friend, I'm busy, and I'm not known\nfor my sense of humor. Or my generosity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not panhandling. I'm looking for a job.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then try elsewhere. Suppose you stop wasting my time, bud. You're as\nEarthborn as I am.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've never been within a dozen parsecs of Earth,\" he said smoothly. \"I\nhappen to be a representative of the only Earthlike race that exists\nanywhere in the Galaxy but on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is a small\nand little-known planet in the Crab Nebula. Through an evolutionary\nfluke, my race is identical with yours. Now, don't you want me in your\ncircus?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. And it's not a circus. It's—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A scientific institute. I stand corrected.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was something glib and appealing about this preposterous phony. I\nguess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on\nhis ear without another word. Instead I played along. \"If you're from\nsuch a distant place, how come you speak English so well?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not speaking. I'm a telepath—not the kind that reads minds, just\nthe kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate\nback to colloquial speech.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Very clever, Mr. Gorb.\" I grinned at him and shook my head. \"You spin\na good yarn—but for my money, you're really Sam Jones or Phil Smith\nfrom Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to\nEarth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low\nthese days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, \"You're making a big\nmistake. I'm just what your outfit needs. A representative of a\nhitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect!\nLook here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I pulled away from his yawning mouth. \"Good-by, Mr. Gorb,\" I repeated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn't much. I'll be a big\nattraction. I'll—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Good-by, Mr. Gorb!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to\nthe door. \"I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think\nit over. Maybe you'll regret your hastiness. I'll be back to give you\nanother chance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile.\nThis was the best con switch yet—an Earthman posing as an alien to get\na job!\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I wasn't buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness\nintellectually. There's no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there's\nonly one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. I was going to need some\nreal good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket\nhome.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that\nreason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a\nKallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I\nhad turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan,\nand said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds.\nHardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the\nKallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him\nofficially.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high,\nand getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three\nstocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture,\nand growled, \"I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me\nimmediately to a contract.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will grant me a contract!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Will you please sit down?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said sulkily, \"I will remain standing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As you prefer.\" My desk has a few concealed features which are\nsometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed\nlife-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of\ntrouble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They're hairy creatures, and\nthis one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his\nbody. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket\nof fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his\nwarlike race.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"You'll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it's not our\npolicy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our\nInstitute. And we're not currently in need of any Kallerian males,\nbecause—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will hire me or trouble I will make!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already\ncarrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. \"Yes, you have\nfour representatives—of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn!\nFor three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to\nthe noble Clan Gursdrinn!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the key-word\n  <i>\n   avenge\n  </i>\n  , I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian\nin a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he\ndidn't move. He bellowed, \"I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to\nEarth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I'm a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and\none of the most important of those principles is that I never let\nmyself be bullied by anyone. \"I deeply regret having unintentionally\ninsulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He glared at me in silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went on, \"Please be assured that I'll undo the insult at the earliest\npossible opportunity. It's not feasible for us to hire another\nKallerian now, but I'll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon\nas a vacancy—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. You will hire me now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It can't be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to\nit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will rue! I will take drastic measures!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I'll\nget in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another\nKallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  You'd think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a\nzoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there's always\nthe chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we're insulting\nall the others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and\nLudlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left.\nThey surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him\naway. He wasn't minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked\nthem both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw,\nbut he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was\nout in the hall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next\napplicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped\nopen and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come here, you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stebbins?\" I said gently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he\ncame running in—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Please, please,\" squeaked the little alien pitifully. \"I must see you,\nhonored sir!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't his turn in line,\" Stebbins protested. \"There are at least\nfifty ahead of him.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" I said tiredly. \"As long as he's in here already, I might\nas well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking\ncreature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a\nlustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His\ntail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at\nfull volume.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a\nbeing of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel\nto Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with\nyourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"I'd better tell you right at the outset that we're already\ncarrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a\nfemale now and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is known to me. The female—is her name perchance Tiress?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian\nentry. \"Yes, that's her name.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. \"It is she!\nIt is she!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm afraid we don't have room for any more—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress,\nshe is—was—my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life\nand my love.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Funny,\" I said. \"When we signed her three years ago, she said she was\nsingle. It's right here on the chart.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors\nof Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry,\nlanguishing in sadness and pining for her return. You\n  <i>\n   must\n  </i>\n  take me to\nEarth!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I must see her—her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must\nreason with her. Earthman, can't you see I must appeal to her inner\nflame?\n  <i>\n   I must bring her back!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  My face was expressionless. \"You don't really intend to join our\norganization at all—you just want free passage to Earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, yes!\" wailed the Stortulian. \"Find some other member of my race,\nif you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead\nlump of stone?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It isn't, but another of my principles is to refuse to be swayed by\nsentiment. I felt sorry for this being's domestic troubles, but I\nwasn't going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel\nhappy—not to mention footing the transportation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"I don't see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict\non the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for\nscientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in\ncoming isn't scientific, I can't in all conscience\n  <i>\n   lie\n  </i>\n  for you, can\nI?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course not.\" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right\nalong. \"Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up,\nI might conceivably have done it. But no—you had to go unburden your\nheart to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought the truth would move you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It did. But in effect you're now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent\ncriminal act. Friend, I can't do it. My reputation means too much to\nme,\" I said piously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you will refuse me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can't take you to Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There's a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an\nunwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of\nscientific interest, and the World Government will deport the\nundesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn't pull a low\ntrick like that on our female Stortulian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"I'll ask her about coming home. But I won't ship her back\nagainst her will. And maybe she's happier where she is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask\nhis tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a\nliving dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, \"There is no hope then. All\nis lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping.\nI watched him shuffle out. I do have\n  <i>\n   some\n  </i>\n  conscience, and I had the\nuneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to\ncommit suicide on my account.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  About fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life\nstarted to get complicated again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason\nor another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the\nday so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian's\noutraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door opened\nand the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII\nstepped in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How did\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  get in here?\" I demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,\" he said cheerily.\n\"Change your mind about me yet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Get out before I have you thrown out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gorb shrugged. \"I figured you hadn't changed your mind, so I've changed\nmy pitch a bit. If you won't believe I'm from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I\ntell you that I\n  <i>\n   am\n  </i>\n  Earthborn, and that I'm looking for a job on your\nstaff.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't care\n  <i>\n   what\n  </i>\n  your story is! Get out or—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"—you'll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second.\nCorrigan, you're no fool, and neither am I—but that fellow of yours\noutside\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  . He doesn't know how to handle alien beings. How many\ntimes today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I scowled at him. \"Too damn many.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You see? He's incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead.\nI've been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is to\nknow about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling of\nthe office before I spoke. \"Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is,\nI've had a hard day. There's been a Kallerian in here who just about\nthreatened murder, and there's been a Stortulian in here who's about\nto commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it's troubling\nme. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and\ngo home to Earth. I don't want you hanging around here bothering me.\nI'm not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to\nclaiming you're an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is\nthat I'm not looking for any of\n  <i>\n   those\n  </i>\n  either. Now will you scram or—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian,\ncame thundering in.

A few driblets of\nbluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door\nflew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the\ngreen sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down\nat the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are J. F.

Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to\nthis late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, no, but—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Closing my eyes wearily, I tried to wish the whole babbling lot of them\naway. If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was\ngoing to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I\nremembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to\ncome bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000\nper suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced\narrival.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway\nand stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian\npolicemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a\nmoment and turned to eye the newcomer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I\nresolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again—or, if I\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against\ncrackpots.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer\nworth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me\nto do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers\ngoing down the drain. \"Stop him, somebody! He's going to kill himself!\nHe's—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me\nflying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the\nmeshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I\nguess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole\nin the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I\nsaw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The\nman who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting\nhimself off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that\nStortulian wasn't here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get\nyou.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying\nfragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed\nplaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the\nstruggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian\npsychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely\nabhorrent to them. When they're troubled, they kill the person who\ncaused their trouble. In this case, you.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I began to chuckle—more of a tension-relieving snicker than a\nfull-bodied laugh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Funny,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is?\" asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye and\nkilled\n  <i>\n   himself\n  </i>\n  , and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek and\npathetic damn near blew my head off.\" I shuddered. \"Thanks for the\ntackle job.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't mention it,\" Gorb said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I glared at the Ghrynian police. \"Well? What are you waiting for? Take\nthat murderous little beast out of here! Or isn't murder against the\nlocal laws?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Stortulian will be duly punished,\" replied the leader of the\nGhrynian cops calmly. \"But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian\nand the fine of—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"—one hundred thousand dollars. I know.\" I groaned and turned to\nStebbins. \"Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them\nsend down a legal adviser. Find out if there's any way we can get out\nof this mess with our skins intact.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right, Chief.\" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hold it,\" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. \"The Consulate can't help\nyou. I can.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You?\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can get you out of this cheap.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   How\n  </i>\n  cheap?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gorb grinned rakishly. \"Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a\nspecimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That's a heck of a\nlot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn't\nbe much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they\nwere really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials\never worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand,\ngiving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell you what,\" I said finally. \"You've got yourself a deal—but on\na contingency basis. Get me out of this and you'll have five grand and\nthe contract.

Mr. Corrigan owns a popular zoo on Earth called the Corrigan Institute - the only place where humans can see other species of the universe. He recruits alien life forms to exhibit at the zoo, and relatively quickly signs eleven new specimens onto his current 690 that are under contract at the institute on earth. This is a viable business because the World Congress declared Earth off-bounds to aliens in 2903, and the only way aliens can now go to Earth is as exhibits in this zoo.\n\nAliens make great sacrifices to come interview with Mr. Corrigan, as it seems he offers them a good deal. Those under contract are required to remain on exhibit for less than one-third of each day and get paid $50 Galactic a week, with expenses and transportation included. \n\nHe interviews many different creatures through the day, with some being noteworthy and some not as much, being ushered away quickly by Mr. Corrigan’s assistant Stebbins. \n\nA Stortulian who claims his wife ran away to the Corrigan Institute, leaving him alone and unable to remarry due to his customs, pleads with Corrigan to let him go to Earth or at the very least to send her back. Mr. Corrigan is slightly frazzled by the story, but ultimately asks the Stortulian to leave, feeling sad and that he may commit suicide upon leaving and losing hope for his wife to return.\nVallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV, was another notable interview. He stormed in and demanded to be signed to contract - and Mr. Corrigan preferred to make his own decisions. Herald felt insulted that the only four Kallerians at the institute were from the Clan Verdrokh, with no representation at all from his Clan Gursdrinn. Corrigan insisted he was unable to take another Kallerian, and apologized for insulting Clan Gursdrinn. This was enough to de-escalate physical violence, but Heraal was not pleased, and had to be escorted out of the room by Auchinleck and Ludlow who were summoned when Corrigan pushed a panic button under his desk.\nIn a surprise twist from what Corrigan had expected - the Stortulian to kill himself, and for Heraal to try to kill him - the opposite happens. Heraal storms in and stabs himself with his own sword, killing him instantly. The Stortulian returns and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, who is narrowly saved by being tackled by Gorb. The Ghrynian cops attempt to place a $100,000 fine on Corrigan for causing the death of a being (Heraal, who killed himself after being refused a contract).

His first applicant of the day walks in: a round creature with five eyed-arms and two legs. He introduces himself as Lawrence R. Fitzgerald of Regulus II, showing himself to be a Terraphile. Corrigan signs him on for half the normal pay and sends him on his way. A urisinoid from Aldebaran IX is next, but Corrigan has no need for another one. He signs a creature from Donovan’s Planet, since they are such crowd-pleasers, and nine more. He also turns down at least 87 other life-forms, only of which, a Vegan, he feels remorse about. \nHis last specimen before lunch seems to be an Earthman pulling a con. He calls himself Ildwar Gorb and claims he’s from Wazzenaxx XIII. Corrigan doesn’t believe his tale and sends him out, though Gorb promises he’ll change his mind before long. \nAfter lunch, trouble starts to arise. A Kallerian comes in and demands a place in his zoo, even though they already have four. Vallo Heraal of Clan Gursdrinn feels Corrigan has insulted his clan by only hiring members of Clan Verdrokh. Corrigan tries to calm him, but nothing can assuage his anger. He presses his trouble button, and his men come in and take Heraal away. \nA small alien runs into the room, sneaking past Stebbins, and begs to be brought to Earth so he can reunite with his soulmate, a previously hired Stortulian.

He snuck past his men and offers himself as staff. Corrigan says no, but just then the Kallerian comes crashing in and commits hara-kiri, killing himself in front of the crowd. The police enter and claim Corrigan was the cause of his death since he had just filed a complaint against him. He can either be arrested or fined $100K. Next, the Stortulian walks back in and claims there is no reason to keep living. Unlike the Kallerian, he attempts to murder Corrigan by shooting his gun.

Corrigan is the proprietor of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, a glorified Terran zoo that offers spectators a glimpse at several hundred species of non-terrestrial life forms from all over the galaxy. Corrigan prides himself on actually employing his exhibits rather than hunting them down. Because Earth had closed its borders in the 29th century to non-terrestrial visitors, getting a job at Corrigan's zoo is a popular way for non-terrestrials to visit the planet and make a decent living at the same time. Corrigan offers good pay, short hours, and cover transportation costs and other expenses. Although he is generous, he is also thrifty and not above conning the public in the name of advancing his business. Corrigan arrives at the planet Ghryne to interview potential new non-terrestrials for his exhibition assisted by his employees Stebbins, Auchinleck, and Ludlow. He interviews dozens of non-terrestrials from planets all over the galaxy, including Mr. Lawrence R. Fitzgerald, a self-described Terraphile from Regulus II who wants to go to Earth so badly he is willing to work for less pay. Next, Corrigan meets Ildwar Gorb, a non-terrestrial from Wazzenazz XIII who looks remarkably like a human and claims to communicate through telepathic projection. Because of this similarity, Corrigan suspects him of actually being an Earthman attempting to con him for a free ride back to Earth. He dismisses Gorb, who implores him to reconsider and promises to return. After Gorb leaves, a Kallerian named Vallo Heraal enters and demands Corrigan hire him immediately or he will cause trouble. Wary of the Kallerian's size and threats, Corrigan fingers the meshgun trigger hidden under his desk in case he needs to protect himself. After Auchinleck and Ludlow escort Heraal out of the room, a small Stortulian enters Corrigan's office and tells him he doesn't want to work for him necessarily, but he is seeking passage to Earth so he can be reunited with his wife, who is currently under Corrigan's employ at the Institute.  When Corrigan refuses, the Stortulian leaves, and Corrigan process several dozen more applicants. When Gorb reenters and offers to replace Stebbins due to his incompetent handling of the non-terrestrials waiting in line, Corrigan threatens to have him thrown out. At that moment, Heraal returns, brandishing a large sword, which he uses to kill himself in front of everyone. As Corrigan processes this turn of events, the Ghrynian police enter and charge Corrigan with Heraal's death which includes a $100,000 Galactic fine. Next, the Stortulian reenters and attempts to shoot Corrigan, who is saved by Gorb.

Throughout the day, Corrigan interviews many colorful, interesting alien life forms, ultimately hiring about two dozen. His goal is to have a collection of at least one member of 500 different races and currently has 298. He rejects some applicants simply because he already has specimens of their type. One applicant, Gorb, looks and sounds like a human but claims to be from a plant named Wazzenazz XIII. Corrigan is convinced he is just a human and sends him on his way, but Gorb says he will be back to give Corrigan another chance. \nLater in the day, Corrigan has two troublesome interviews, the first with a distraught Kallerian named Vallo Heraal who wants to be hired because four other Kallerians have been hired from a different clan than his, and he feels his clan has been insulted. Corrigan apologizes for having unintentionally insulted Heraal’s clan but explains that he doesn’t need any more Kallerians now; he offers to give preference to Heraal’s clan when there is a vacancy. Unappeased, Heraal warns Corrigan that he will be sorry, and Corrigan sends for members of his team to escort him out. Next, a squirrely-looking Stortulian slips in, exclaiming that he must speak with Corrigan. The Stortulian explains that he is there because his wife is on Earth in Corrigan’s display. She left him because she wanted to go to Earth, and now he is lonely but forbidden by his customs to remarry. He doesn’t want to be hired but just wants passage to Earth to persuade his wife to return home. Corrigan patiently tells the Stortulian he can’t take him because it would be illegal. The Stortullian accepts defeat, saying he has no hope at all, and Corrigan has the distinct impression that the fellow is going to commit suicide. \nAt the end of the day, Gorb returns, asking Corrigan to hire him to work with his company. Heraal crashes in and tells Corrigan he has contacted the authorities and accused him of causing the death of a life-form before he kills himself.

Corrigan is the proprietor of Corrigan's Institute of Morphological Science, a Terran zoo exhibiting non-terrestrial beings from around the universe. Starting out as an impoverished carnival man working in the Betelgeuse system, Corrigan had taken advantage of the isolationism of the late 29th century to establish his zoo and become a successful businessman. Corrigan claims to not want to exploit the non-terrestrials he employs as displays in his zoo, but he also doesn't want to pay them top dollar for their services. He prides himself on not hunting non-terrestrial and instead prefers to attract them by offering good pay, short hours, expenses, and transportation costs; in addition, he calls himself a \"man of principles\" and advertises about the thrill of show business and romance of life on Earth. Because Corrigan is willing to con the public--he calls himself \"a straightforward double-dealer\"--he believes he understands a con when he sees one, which is why he initially rejects Gorb's interview for a job. Corrigan is used to dealing with species from all over the galaxy, and he is prepared for trouble, so he has a meshgun trigger concealed below his desk and never allows himself to be bullied. In case he needs back up, he also employs Stebbins, who manages the line of non-terrestrials for Corrigan to interview, as well as Auchinleck and Ludlow. One of Corrigan's driving principles in dealing with non-terrestrials is to never make a business decision based upon sentiment as demonstrated by his dealings with the Stortulian.

Corrigan is a businessman and owner of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science. An astute businessman who also manipulates and uses others, he has built a lucrative “institute” that is really just a zoo that exhibits odd-looking aliens. Before his current position, Corrigan was a lowly carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. After the World Congress ruled Terra off-limits for aliens in 2903, Corrigan concocted his business plan. His goal is to display representatives of 500 extraterrestrial species. Corrigan can “read” his interviewees and take advantage of them for his own benefit. For example, when he realizes how eager Mr. Fitzgerald is to see Earth, he hires him for half of what he usually pays, knowing that Fitzgerald’s eagerness will prevent him from realizing the offer takes advantage of him. \n\tThroughout the day of interviews, Corrigan assesses the applicants in terms of their value to him. While he doesn’t mind taking advantage of them, he doesn’t go so far as to cheat them. He is a bit of a con-man himself, hiring Mr. Fitz for half his going rate and placating Heraal with a less-than-heartfelt apology and promise to give members of his clan preference the next time they need to hire a Kallerian. Yet he won’t do anything that blatantly breaks the law such as transporting a Stortulian to Earth when the alien isn’t one of his hirees. He has a limited conscience; when he fears that the Stortulian will commit suicide, he feels bad about it, but he also doesn’t do anything to prevent it. His pragmatism and business acumen override his emotions, preventing him from caving to the creature’s requests, even if it means the creature will commit suicide. Corrigan is also sharp enough to spot a con; he recognizes Gorb for what he is: an Earthman using any means possible to obtain a paid trip to Earth. When Gorb comes across as glib and appealing despite his preposterous story, Corrigan recognizes the man’s similarity to himself. Corrigan acknowledges that he is a double-dealer yets describes himself as a man of principles. Because he is a con man, he is cynical of others. Corrigan is also a manipulator who says what others want to hear (such as calling the planet Ghryne by its native name) because he knows this is a way to win their trust.\n\tCorrigan likes to think of himself as a man who has principles, but some of those principles are the ones that ensure good business decisions rather than the values regarding what is right or wrong. He also thinks of himself as a man with a conscience who doesn’t exploit beings, but that is exactly what he does. He believes that because he pays his employees and they are volunteering to be placed on exhibit, he isn’t exploiting them.\n\n"}]}, {"question_text": "Describe the settings the story takes place in.", "question_number": 5, "responses": [{"worker_id": "10", "uid": "a7f565ae5ede4db6983127542cfd1675", "response_text": "The story takes place during a single day in Mr. Corrigan’s rented office on the planet Ghryne some time after the year 2903.

The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\ningredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\nsmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and\nthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\nMartians or Venusians.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it\nwas the dead man's hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Coma esta, senor?\n  </i>\n  \" a small voice piped. \"\n  <i>\n   Speken die Deutsch?\nDesirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet?\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben looked down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was like\na red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn\nskivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm American,\" Ben muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ah,\n  <i>\n   buena\n  </i>\n  ! I speak English\n  <i>\n   tres\n  </i>\n  fine,\n  <i>\n   senor\n  </i>\n  . I have Martian\nfriend, she\n  <i>\n   tres\n  </i>\n  pretty and\n  <i>\n   tres\n  </i>\n  fat.

I don't want your opium\nor your Devil's Egg or your Venusian kali. But if you had a drug that'd\nbring a dead man to life, I'd buy and pay with my soul.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is deal,\n  <i>\n   monsieur\n  </i>\n  ? Five dollars or twenty\n  <i>\n   keelis\n  </i>\n  for visit\nMartian friend. Maybe you like House of Dreams. For House of Dreams—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not buying.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dirty-faced kid shrugged. \"Then I show you to good table,—\n  <i>\n   tres\nbien\n  </i>\n  . I do not charge you,\n  <i>\n   senor\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The boy grabbed his hand. Because Ben could think of no reason for\nresisting, he followed. They plunged into shifting layers of smoke and\nthrough the drone of alcohol-cracked voices.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  They passed the bar with its line of lean-featured, slit-eyed\nEarthmen—merchant spacemen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They wormed down a narrow aisle flanked by booths carved from Venusian\nmarble that jutted up into the semi-darkness like fog-blanketed\ntombstones.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Several times, Ben glimpsed the bulky figures of CO\n  2\n  -breathing\nVenusians, the first he'd ever seen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were smoky gray, scaly, naked giants, toads in human shape.\nThey stood solitary and motionless, aloof, their green-lidded eyes\nunblinking. They certainly didn't look like telepaths, as Ben had heard\nthey were, but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once he spied a white-uniformed officer of Hoover City's Security\nPolice. The man was striding down an aisle, idly tapping his neuro-club\nagainst the stone booths.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Keep walking\n  </i>\n  , Ben told himself.\n  <i>\n   You look the same as anyone else\nhere. Keep walking. Look straight ahead.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The officer passed. Ben breathed easier.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here we are,\n  <i>\n   monsieur\n  </i>\n  ,\" piped the Martian boy. \"A\n  <i>\n   tres\n  </i>\n  fine table.\nClose in the shadows.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben winced. How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows?\nFrowning, he sat down—he and the dead man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He listened to the lonely rhythms of the four-piece Martian orchestra.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Martians were fragile, doll-like creatures with heads too large for\ntheir spindly bodies. Their long fingers played upon the strings of\ntheir\n  <i>\n   cirillas\n  </i>\n  or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider\nlegs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still\nseemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and\nforgotten grandeur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For an instant, Ben's mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead\nman. He thought,\n  <i>\n   What are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in\na smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world?\nCouldn't they have played their music on Mars? Or had they, like me,\nfelt the challenge of new worlds?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sobered. It didn't matter. He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese\nwaiter. He wet his lips but did not drink. His gaze wandered over the\nfaces of the Inn's other occupants.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You've got to find him\n  </i>\n  , he thought.\n  <i>\n   You've got to find the man with\nthe red beard. It's the only way you can escape the dead man.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby and\nabout forty and he hated spacemen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His body was buried now—probably in the silent gray wastes outside\nLuna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a\npart of Ben as sight in his eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips\nspitting whiskey-slurred curses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fist\nthudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the\nwhiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle\nfrom a corner of the gaping mouth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or\nignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from a\nmemory that has burned into your mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had\nbeen successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate.\nHe stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb\nplopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Spacemen,\" he muttered, \"are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you\nsee's spacemen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was a neatly dressed civilian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben smiled. \"If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The name's Cobb.\" The man hiccoughed. \"Spacemen in their white monkey\nsuits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're a\nlittle tin god.\" He downed a shot of whiskey.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,\ncrimson-braided uniform of the\n  <i>\n   Odyssey's\n  </i>\n  junior astrogation officer.\nHe was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining\nuniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd sought long for that key.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At the age of five—perhaps in order to dull the memory of his parents'\ndeath in a recent strato-jet crash—he'd spent hours watching the night\nsky for streaking flame-tails of Moon rockets. At ten, he'd ground\nhis first telescope. At fourteen, he'd converted an abandoned shed on\nthe government boarding-school grounds to a retreat which housed his\ncollection of astronomy and rocketry books.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At sixteen, he'd spent every weekend holiday hitchhiking from Boys\nTown No. 5 in the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport. There, among\nthe grizzled veterans of the old Moon Patrol, he'd found friends who\nunderstood his dream and who later recommended his appointment to the\nU. S. Academy for the Conquest of Space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And a month ago, he'd signed aboard the\n  <i>\n   Odyssey\n  </i>\n  —the first ship, it\nwas rumored, equipped to venture as far as the asteroids and perhaps\nbeyond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cobb was persistent: \"Damn fools shoulda known enough to stay on Earth.\nWhat the hell good is it, jumpin' from planet to planet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The guy's drunk\n  </i>\n  , Ben thought. He took his drink and moved three\nstools down the bar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cobb followed. \"You don't like the truth, eh, kid? You don't like\npeople to call you a sucker.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben rose and started to leave the bar, but Cobb grabbed his arm and\nheld him there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thas what you are—a sucker. You're young now. Wait ten years. You'll\nbe dyin' of radiation rot or a meteor'll get you. Wait and see, sucker!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Until this instant, Ben had suppressed his anger. Now, suddenly and\nwithout warning, it welled up into savage fury.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His fist struck the man on the chin. Cobb's eyes gaped in shocked\nhorror. He spun backward. His head cracked sickeningly on the edge of\nthe bar. The sound was like a punctuation mark signaling the end of\nlife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sank to the floor, eyes glassy, blood tricking down his jaw.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben knew that he was dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror—just as,\na moment before, he'd been overwhelmed with anger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ran.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world\nof dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw\nthat he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the\ncity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette.\nA thousand stars—a thousand motionless balls of silver fire—shone\nabove him through Luna City's transparent dome.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was sorry he'd hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he'd run.\nEscaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You can do two things\n  </i>\n  , he thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do.\nThat would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary\nmanslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in\nprison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new\nmen over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class\njet-men on beat-up freighters—they don't want convicted killers. You'd\nget the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by\npeeking through electric fences of spaceports.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Or—\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who\noperated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't\noutlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the\nsouped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their\nheadquarters was Venus. Their leader—a subject of popular and\nfantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines—was rumored to be a\nred-bearded giant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   So\n  </i>\n  , Ben reflected,\n  <i>\n   you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously.\nYou can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your\nname. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your\nduty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from\nEarth.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant\nsecond, to destroy a man's life and his dream?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You look for someone,\n  <i>\n   senor\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Oui.\n  </i>\n  \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\nkeep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\n  <i>\n   n'est-ce-pas\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are spacemen?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\nyou?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\n  <i>\n   Ich danke, senor.\n  </i>\n  You\nknow why city is called Hoover City?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben didn't answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\nthousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\n  <i>\n   monsieur\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Ai-yee\n  </i>\n  , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him—reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He needed help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Light showered the room in a dazzling explosion. Ben, half blinded,\nrealized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been\nturned on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The light washed away the room's strangeness and its air of brooding\nwickedness, revealing drab concrete walls and a debris-strewn floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eyes blinked and squinted. There were swift, frightened movements and\na chorus of angry murmurs. The patrons of the Blast Inn were like\ntatter-clad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect. His chair tumbled backward,\nfalling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The white-clad men charged, neuro-clubs upraised.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A woman screamed. The music ceased. The Martian orchestra slunk with\nfeline stealth to a rear exit. Only the giant Venusians remained\nundisturbed. They stood unmoving, their staring eyes shifting lazily in\nBen's direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Curtis!\" one of the policemen yelled. \"You're covered! Hold it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben whirled away from the advancing police, made for the exit into\nwhich the musicians had disappeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air\nescaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall\nahead of him crumbled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the\nmildly stunning neuro-clubs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit.\n  <i>\n   Another second\n  </i>\n  , his brain screamed.\n  <i>\n   Just another second—\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or would the exits be guarded?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard the hiss.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a\nslight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be\ngrowing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny\nneedle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing\nmortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of\nhis body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He'd have\nfifteen—maybe twenty—seconds before complete lethargy of mind and\nbody overpowered him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness, he heard a voice\nyell, \"Turn on the damn lights!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand. He realized that\nsomeone had seized it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A soft feminine voice spoke to him. \"You're wounded? They hit you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\" His thick lips wouldn't let go of the word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You want to escape—even now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You may die if you don't give yourself up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, no.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to stumble toward the exit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right then. Not that way. Here, this way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight\nflicked on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hands were guiding him. He was aware of being pushed and pulled. A\ndoor closed behind him. The glare of the flashlight faded from his\nvision—if he still had vision.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're sure?\" the voice persisted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sure,\" Ben managed to say.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have no antidote. You may die.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection,\nmassage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain\nwithin half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to\nheart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective\nweapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender\nat once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Anti ... anti ...\" The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced\nfrom his throat. \"No ... I'm sure ... sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't hear the answer or anything else.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ben Curtis had no precise sensation of awakening. Return to\nconsciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black\nnothingness to a dream-like state of awareness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders,\nhands that massaged, manipulated, fought to restore circulation and\nsensitivity. He knew they were strong hands. Their strength seemed to\ntransfer itself to his own body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a long time, he tried to open his eyes. His lids felt welded\nshut. But after a while, they opened. His world of darkness gave way\nto a translucent cloak of mist. A round, featureless shape hovered\nconstantly above him—a face, he supposed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to talk. Although his lips moved slightly, the only sound was\na deep, staccato grunting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he heard someone say, \"Don't try to talk.\" It was the same gentle\nvoice he'd heard in the Blast Inn. \"Don't talk. Just lie still and\nrest. Everything'll be all right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Everything all right\n  </i>\n  , he thought dimly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were long periods of lethargy when he was aware of nothing. There\nwere periods of light and of darkness. Gradually he grew aware of\nthings. He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spaceman's oxygen\nmask was clamped over his nose. He felt the heat of electric blankets\nswathed about his body. Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and\nhe would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Always, it seemed, the face was above him, floating in the obscuring\nmist. Always, it seemed, the soft voice was echoing in his ears:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Swallow this now. That's it. You must have food.\" Or, \"Close your\neyes. Don't strain. It won't be long. You're getting better.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Better\n  </i>\n  , he'd think.\n  <i>\n   Getting better....\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  At last, after one of the periods of lethargy, his eyes opened. The\nmist brightened, then dissolved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He beheld the cracked, unpainted ceiling of a small room, its colorless\nwalls broken with a single, round window. He saw the footboard of his\naluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are better?\" the kind voice asked.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twenty-five\nand thirty. Her features, devoid of makeup, had an unhealthy-looking\npallor, as if she hadn't used a sunlamp for many weeks. Yet, at the\nsame time, her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength. Her\nstraight brown hair was combed backward, tight upon her scalp, and\ndrawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—I am better,\" he murmured. His words were still slow and thick. \"I\nam going to live?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will live.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He thought for a moment. \"How long have I been here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nine days.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You took care of me?\" He noted the deep, dark circles beneath her\nsleep-robbed eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're the one who carried me when I was shot?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly he began to cough. Breath came hard. She held the oxygen mask\nin readiness. He shook his head, not wanting it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\" he asked again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It would be a long story. Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A new thought, cloaked in sudden fear, entered his murky consciousness.\n\"Tell me, will—will I be well again? Will I be able to walk?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lay back then, panting, exhausted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You have nothing to worry about,\" the girl said softly. Her cool hand\ntouched his hot forehead. \"Rest. We'll talk later.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes closed and breath came easier. He slept.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he next awoke, his gaze turned first to the window. There was\nlight outside, but he had no way of knowing if this was morning, noon\nor afternoon—or on what planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw no white-domed buildings of Hoover City, no formal lines of\ngreen-treed parks, no streams of buzzing gyro-cars. There was only a\ntranslucent and infinite whiteness. It was as if the window were set on\nthe edge of the Universe overlooking a solemn, silent and matterless\nvoid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl entered the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hi,\" she said, smiling. The dark half-moons under her eyes were less\nprominent. Her face was relaxed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She increased the pressure in his rubberex pillows and helped him rise\nto a sitting position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are we?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Venus.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're not in Hoover City?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at her, wondering. \"You won't tell me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not yet. Later, perhaps.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then how did you get me here? How did we escape from the Inn?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She shrugged. \"We have friends who can be bribed. A hiding place in the\ncity, the use of a small desert-taxi, a pass to leave the city—these\ncan be had for a price.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll tell me your name?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maggie.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did you save me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her eyes twinkled mischievously. \"Because you're a good astrogator.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His own eyes widened. \"How did you know that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sat on a plain chair beside his bed. \"I know everything about you,\nLieutenant Curtis.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How did you learn my name? I destroyed all my papers—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know that you're twenty-four. Born July 10, 1971. Orphaned at four,\nyou attended Boys Town in the Catskills till you were 19. You graduated\nfrom the Academy at White Sands last June with a major in Astrogation.\nYour rating for the five-year period was 3.8—the second highest in a\nclass of fifty-seven. Your only low mark in the five years was a 3.2 in\nHistory of Martian Civilization. Want me to go on?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fascinated, Ben nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were accepted as junior astrogation officer aboard the\n  <i>\n   Odyssey\n  </i>\n  .\nYou did well on your flight from Roswell to Luna City. In a barroom\nfight in Luna City, you struck and killed a man named Arthur Cobb, a\npre-fab salesman. You've been charged with second degree murder and\nescape. A reward of 5,000 credits has been offered for your capture.\nYou came to Hoover City in the hope of finding a renegade group of\nspacemen who operate beyond Mars. You were looking for them in the\nBlast Inn.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He gaped incredulously, struggling to rise from his pillows. \"I—don't\nget it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are ways of finding out what we want to know. As I told you, we\nhave many friends.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He fell back into his pillows, breathing hard. She rose quickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have told you yet. I felt so happy\nbecause you're alive. Rest now. We'll talk again soon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maggie, you—you said I'd live. You didn't say I'd be able to walk\nagain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She lowered her gaze. \"I hope you'll be able to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you don't think I will, do you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know. We'll try walking tomorrow. Don't think about it now.\nRest.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to relax, but his mind was a vortex of conjecture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just one more question,\" he almost whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The man I killed—did he have a wife?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She hesitated. He thought,\n  <i>\n   Damn it, of all the questions, why did I\nask that?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally she said, \"He had a wife.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Children?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two. I don't know their ages.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She left the room.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n  <i>\n   red beard\n  </i>\n  !\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He awoke still screaming....\n </p>\n <p>\n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n  <i>\n   were\n  </i>\n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who is he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where is he?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us—and a home for me. When his\nship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been\nstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\nInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how\nwe operate?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He told her the tales he'd heard.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She nodded. \"There are quite a few of us now—about a thousand—and a\ndozen ships. Our base used to be here on Venus, down toward the Pole.\nThe dome we're in now was designed and built by us a few years ago\nafter we got pushed off Mars. We lost a few men in the construction,\nbut with almost every advance in space, someone dies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Venus is getting too civilized. We're moving out and this dome is only\na temporary base when we have cases like yours. The new base—I might\nas well tell you it's going to be an asteroid. I won't say which one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't get the idea that we're outlaws. Sure, about half our group is\nwanted by the Bureau, but we make honest livings. We're just people\nlike yourself and Jacob.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jacob? Your husband?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She laughed. \"Makes you think of a Biblical character, doesn't it?\nJacob's anything but that. And just plain 'Jake' reminds one of a\ngrizzled old uranium prospector and he isn't like that, either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She lit a cigarette. \"Anyway, the wanted ones stay out beyond the\nfrontiers. Jacob and those like him can never return to Earth—not even\nto Hoover City—except dead. The others are physical or psycho rejects\nwho couldn't get clearance if they went back to Earth. They know\nnothing but rocketing and won't give up. They bring in our ships to\nfrontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't the authorities object?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here to\nsearch the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carry\ncargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that's\nscarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether it\ncomes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives mining\nit, that's our business.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She pursed her lips. \"But if they guessed how strong we are or that we\nhave friends planted in the I. B. I.—well, things might be different.\nThere probably would be a crackdown.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ben scowled. \"What happens if there\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  a crackdown? And what will you\ndo when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can't\nignore you then.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them\nto Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll be\npushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won't be the white-suited\nboys who'll make that first hop to the stars. It\n  <i>\n   could\n  </i>\n  be us, you\nknow—if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder. You\ncan't follow the text-book rules of astrogation out there. You make up\nyour own.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Ben stiffened. \"And that's why you want me for an astrogator.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. \"If you want to come—and if you get\nwell.\" She looked at him strangely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Suppose—\" He fought to find the right words. \"Suppose I got well and\ndecided not to join Jacob. What would happen to me? Would you let me\ngo?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion—alarm, then bewilderment,\nthen fear. \"I don't know. That would be up to Jacob.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched his\nhand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotion\nthat had coursed through her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The only thing that matters, really,\" she murmured, \"is your walking\nagain. We'll try this afternoon. Okay?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob's photo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was like two people, he thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one single\nstarry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when she\nwas alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A Space Officer Is Honest\" \"A Space Officer Is Loyal.\" \"A Space\nOfficer Is Dutiful.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts,\nmankind would never have broken away from the planet that held it\nprisoner for half a million years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead,\nwould never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "2418299adb5540d7a8f9d87b9e5e0f01", "response_text": "Ben Curtis enters a dark gin mill followed by the dead man and a boy offers him a wench.

While he sits, Ben is unable to shake the image of a dead man next to him, who is a man named Cobb. Prior to Ben's arrival to Venus, he had stepped into a bar in Luna City, where an intoxicated Cobb was rambling about spacemen and how he despises them.

For 9+ days, he goes in and out of sleep in this room while he recovers from his injuries. Maggie, the woman who helped him escape, is the one helping him recover from his injuries. She knows a lot of information about him and his background. \n\nWhile still recovering, Ben notices that on one side of the bed, there is a picture on a bureau in the far corner of the room that shows a portrait of a red-bearded man. He gets really excited at this new revelation. He asks Maggie about the red-bearded man and she confesses that he is her husband and then explains what he does and why she brought Ben with her. Jacob’s group needs an astrogator and want Ben to join them. While Maggie shows that she would be confused if Ben chose not to join the group, she seems to truly be concerned with his recovery. \n\nWhen Maggie leaves the room, Ben reflects on words found in a book from his childhood that talk about the morals of a Space Officer. He acknowledges how very few are able to get the job in the SpaceCorps. The story ends with implications that Ben will choose his moral values and choose not to join Jacob’s group. \n"}]}, {"question_text": "Describe the setting of the story.", "question_number": 2, "responses": [{"worker_id": "105", "uid": "2418299adb5540d7a8f9d87b9e5e0f01", "response_text": "The story begins in the Blast Inn, a dim gin mill with a sense of evil.

His black\nthatch was ruffled, as if he had been rubbed the wrong way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't ask you to cut out your own graft, did I?\" he demanded.\n\"Just don't try to sucker me in on the deal. I know you're operating\nsomething sneaky all through the colony, but it's not for me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The big moon-face of Jeffers, manager of the Ganymedan branch of\nKoslow Spaceways, glowered back at him. Its reddish tinge brightened\nthe office noticeably, for such of Ganymede's surface as could be seen\nthrough the transparent dome outside the office window was cold, dim\nand rugged. The glowing semi-disk of Jupiter was more than half a\nmillion miles distant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Try not to be simple—for once!\" growled Jeffers. \"A little percentage\nhere and there on the cargoes never shows by the time figures get back\nto Earth. The big jets in the home office don't care. They count it on\nthe estimates.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You asked any of them lately?\" Tolliver prodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now,\n  <i>\n   listen\n  </i>\n  ! Maybe they live soft back on Earth since the mines\nand the Jovian satellite colonies grew; but they were out here in the\nbeginning, most of them.\n  <i>\n   They\n  </i>\n  know what it's like. D'ya think they\ndon't expect us to make what we can on the side?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver rammed his fists into the side pockets of his loose blue\nuniform jacket. He shook his head, grinning resignedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You just don't listen to\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  ,\" he complained. \"You know I took this\npiloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degree\nback on Earth. I only want to finish my year—not get into something I\ncan't quit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, causing it to creak under the bulk of\nhis body. It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aw, it's not like that,\" the manager muttered. \"You can ease out\nwhenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on your\naccount?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meeting\nhis eye.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, then!\" Jeffers snapped after a long moment. \"If you want it\nthat way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't fire me,\" retorted the pilot pityingly. \"I came out here\non a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred for\nhazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay I can't fire you legally—as long as you report for work,\"\ngrumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. \"We'll see how long you\nkeep reporting. Because you're off the Callisto run as of now! Sit in\nyour quarters and see if the company calls\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  hazardous duty!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doesn't matter,\" answered Tolliver, grinning amiably. \"The hazardous\npart is just being on the same moon as you for the next six months.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He winked and walked out, deliberately leaving the door open behind him\nso as to enjoy the incoherent bellowing that followed him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Looks like a little vacation\n  </i>\n  , he thought, unperturbed.\n  <i>\n   He'll come\naround. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffers\nand his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It's\ntheir risk.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was \"Tuesday\"\nby the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-long\njourney around Jupiter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected to\nspecify the type of craft to be piloted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the number\nof one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and the\nspaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around the\ngarage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domes\nseemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He swore\nwhen he found the assignment unchanged by \"Friday.\" Even the reflection\nthat it was payday was small consolation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey, Johnny!\" said a voice at his shoulder. \"The word is that they're\nfinally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They say some home-office relative is coming in on the\n  <i>\n   Javelin\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's wrong with that?\" asked Tolliver. \"Outside of the way they keep\nhanding out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can go\nback to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reason\nbut them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economy\norbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under a\nportable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship's\nairlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bags\ninto the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage at\nthe waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly even\nin stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade too\nblonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the cap\napparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavy\nsweater, like a spacer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" she said, sliding into the seat beside\nTolliver. \"By the way, just call me Betty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" agreed Tolliver thinking,\n  <i>\n   Ohmigod! Trying already to be just\none of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer,\nor does he just know where bodies are buried?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They were making dates,\" said the girl. \"Were they ribbing me, or is\nit true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's true enough,\" Tolliver assured her. \"We need people out here, and\nit costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loaded\nships by 'automatic' flight—that is, a long, slow, economical orbit\nand automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approaching\nEarth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their time\nmaking the entire trip.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He followed the signals of a spacesuited member of the port staff and\nmaneuvered out of the dome. Then he headed the tractor across the\nfrozen surface of Ganymede toward the permanent domes of the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How is it here?\" asked the girl. \"They told me it's pretty rough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did you expect?\" asked Tolliver. \"Square dances with champagne?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be silly. Daddy says I'm supposed to learn traffic routing and\nthe business management of a local branch. They probably won't let me\nsee much else.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You never can tell,\" said the pilot, yielding to temptation. \"Any\nsquare inch of Ganymede is likely to be dangerous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   I'll be sorry later\n  </i>\n  , he reflected,\n  <i>\n   but if Jeffers keeps me jockeying\nthis creeper, I'm entitled to some amusement. And Daddy's little girl\nis trying too hard to sound like one of the gang.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah,\" he went on, \"right now, I don't do a thing but drive missions\nfrom the city to the spaceport.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Missions! You call driving a mile or so a\n  <i>\n   mission\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver pursed his lips and put on a shrewd expression.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't sneer at Ganymede, honey!\" he warned portentously. \"Many a\nman who did isn't here today. Take the fellow who used to drive this\nmission!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can call me Betty. What happened to him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll tell you some day,\" Tolliver promised darkly. \"This moon can\nstrike like a vicious animal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, they told me there was nothing alive on Ganymede!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was thinking of the mountain slides,\" said the pilot. \"Not to\nmention volcanic puffballs that pop out through the frozen crust where\nyou'd least expect. That's why I draw such high pay for driving an\nunarmored tractor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You use armored vehicles?\" gasped the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was now sitting bolt upright in the swaying seat. Tolliver\ndeliberately dipped one track into an icy hollow. In the light gravity,\nthe tractor responded with a weird, floating lurch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Those slides,\" he continued. \"Ganymede's only about the size of\nMercury, something like 3200 miles in diameter, so things get heaped up\nat steep angles. When the rock and ice are set to sliding, they come\nat you practically horizontally. It doesn't need much start, and it\nbarrels on for a long way before there's enough friction to stop it. If\nyou're in the way—well, it's just too bad!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Say, that's pretty good!\n  </i>\n  he told himself.\n  <i>\n   What a liar you are,\nTolliver!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He enlarged upon other dangers to be encountered on the satellite,\ntaking care to impress the newcomer with the daredeviltry of John\nTolliver, driver of \"missions\" across the menacing wastes between dome\nand port.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the end, he displayed conclusive evidence in the form of the weekly\npaycheck he had received that morning. It did not, naturally, indicate\nhe was drawing the salary of a space pilot. Betty looked thoughtful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm retiring in six months if I'm still alive,\" he said bravely,\nedging the tractor into the airlock at their destination. \"Made my\npile. No use pushing your luck too far.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His charge seemed noticeably subdued, but cleared her throat to request\nthat Tolliver guide her to the office of the manager. She trailed along\nas if with a burden of worry upon her mind, and the pilot's conscience\nprickled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   I'll get hold of her after Jeffers is through and set her straight\n  </i>\n  ,\nhe resolved.\n  <i>\n   It isn't really funny if the sucker is too ignorant to\nknow better.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Remembering his grudge against the manager, he took pleasure in walking\nin without knocking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jeffers,\" he announced, \"this is ... just call her Betty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The manager's jowled features twisted into an expression of welcome as\njovial as that of a hungry crocodile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Koslow!\" he beamed, like a politician the day before the voting.\n\"It certainly is an honor to have you on Ganymede with us! That's all,\nTolliver, you can go. Yes, indeed! Mr. Koslow—the president, that is:\nyour father—sent a message about you. I repeat, it will be an honor to\nshow you the ropes. Did you want something else, Tolliver?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind him, Mr. Jeffers,\" snapped the girl, in a tone new to\nTolliver. \"We won't be working together, I'm afraid. You've already had\nenough rope.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jeffers seemed to stagger standing still behind his desk. His loose\nlips twitched uncertainly, and he looked questioningly to Tolliver. The\npilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of the\nelder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of the lies he had\ntold en route from the spaceport.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wh-wh-what do you mean, Miss Koslow?\" Jeffers stammered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He darted a suspicious glare at Tolliver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Jeffers,\" said the girl, \"I may look like just another spoiled\nlittle blonde, but the best part of this company will be mine someday.\nI was not allowed to reach twenty-two without learning something about\nholding on to it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver blinked. He had taken her for three or four years older.\nJeffers now ignored him, intent upon the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Daddy gave me the title of tenth vice-president mostly as a joke, when\nhe told me to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede.\nI have\n  <i>\n   some\n  </i>\n  authority, though. And you look like the source of the\ntrouble to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't prove anything,\" declared Jeffers hoarsely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, can't I? I've already seen certain evidence, and the rest won't\nbe hard to find. Where are your books, Mr. Jeffers? You're as good as\nfired!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The manager dropped heavily to his chair. He stared unbelievingly at\nBetty, and Tolliver thought he muttered something about \"just landed.\"\nAfter a moment, the big man came out of his daze enough to stab an\nintercom button with his finger. He growled at someone on the other end\nto come in without a countdown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver, hardly thinking about it, expected the someone to be\na secretary, but it turned out to be three members of Jeffers'\nheadquarters staff. He recognized one as Rawlins, a warehouse chief,\nand guessed that the other two might be his assistants. They were large\nenough.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No stupid questions!\" Jeffers ordered. \"Lock these two up while I\nthink!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver started for the door immediately, but was blocked off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where should we lock—?\" the fellow paused to ask.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the man's chin, feeling that\nit was a poor time to engage Jeffers in fruitless debate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the gravity of Ganymede, the man was knocked off balance as much as\nhe was hurt, and sprawled on the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\n  <i>\n   told\n  </i>\n  you no questions!\" bawled Jeffers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fallen hero, upon arising, had to content himself with grabbing\nBetty. The others were swarming over Tolliver. Jeffers came around his\ndesk to assist.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Tolliver found himself dumped on the floor of an empty office in the\nadjoining warehouse building. It seemed to him that a long time had\nbeen spent in carrying him there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard an indignant yelp, and realized that the girl had been pitched\nin with him. The snapping of a lock was followed by the tramp of\ndeparting footsteps and then by silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind his\nleft ear, a sensation befuddled him momentarily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry about that,\" murmured Betty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver grunted. Sorrow would not reduce the throbbing, nor was he\nin a mood to undertake an explanation of why Jeffers did not like him\nanyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think perhaps you're going to have a shiner,\" remarked the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks for letting me know in time,\" said Tolliver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The skin under his right eye did feel a trifle tight, but he could see\nwell enough. The abandoned and empty look of the office worried him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What can we use to get out of here?\" he mused.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why should we try?\" asked the girl. \"What can he do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'd be surprised. How did you catch on to him so soon?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your paycheck,\" said Betty. \"As soon as I saw that ridiculous amount,\nit was obvious that there was gross mismanagement here. It had to be\nJeffers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver groaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then, on the way over here, he as good as admitted everything. You\ndidn't hear him, I guess. Well, he seemed to be caught all unaware, and\nseemed to blame you for it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure!\" grumbled the pilot. \"He thinks I told you he was grafting or\nsmuggling, or whatever he has going for him here. That's why I want to\nget out of here—before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal\naccident!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you know about the crooked goings-on here?\" asked Betty after\na startled pause.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nothing,\" retorted Tolliver. \"Except that there are some. There are\nrumors, and I had a halfway invitation to join in. I think he sells\nthings to the mining colonies and makes a double profit for himself by\nclaiming the stuff lost in transit. You didn't think you scared him\nthat bad over a little slack managing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The picture of Jeffers huddled with his partners in the headquarters\nbuilding, plotting the next move, brought Tolliver to his feet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was nothing in the unused office but an old table and half a\ndozen plastic crates. He saw that the latter contained a mess of\ndiscarded records.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better than nothing at all,\" he muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ripped out a double handful of the forms, crumpled them into a pile\nat the doorway, and pulled out his cigarette lighter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you think you're up to?\" asked Betty with some concern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This plastic is tough,\" said Tolliver, \"but it will bend with enough\nheat. If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with more papers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know,\" he reflected, \"it might be better for you to stay here.\nHe can't do much about you, and you don't have any real proof just by\nyourself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll come along with you, Tolliver,\" said the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I don't think you'd better.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why not?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well ... after all, what would he dare do? Arranging an accident to\nthe daughter of the boss isn't something that he can pull off without a\nlot of investigation. He'd be better off just running for it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's not argue about it,\" said Betty, a trifle pale but looking\ndetermined. \"I'm coming with you. Is that stuff getting soft yet?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver kicked at the edge of the door experimentally. It seemed to\ngive slightly, so he knocked the burning papers aside and drove his\nheel hard at the corner below the hinge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The plastic yielded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's enough already, Tolliver,\" whispered the girl. \"We can crawl\nthrough!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hardly sixty seconds later, he led her into a maze of stacked crates\nin the warehouse proper. The building was not much longer than wide,\nfor each of the structures in the colony had its own hemispherical\nemergency dome of transparent plastic. They soon reached the other end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think there's a storeroom for spacesuits around here,\" muttered\nTolliver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why do you want them?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Honey, I just don't think it will be so easy to lay hands on a\ntractor. I bet Jeffers already phoned the garage and all the airlocks\nwith some good lie that will keep me from getting through.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a brief search, he located the spacesuits. Many, evidently\nintended for replacements, had never been unpacked, but there were a\ndozen or so serviced and standing ready for emergencies. He showed\nBetty how to climb into one, and checked her seals and valves after\ndonning a suit himself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That switch under your chin,\" he said, touching helmets so she could\nhear him. \"Leave it turned off.\n  <i>\n   Anybody\n  </i>\n  might be listening!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He led the way out a rear door of the warehouse. With the heavy knife\nthat was standard suit equipment, he deliberately slashed a four-foot\nsquare section out of the dome. He motioned to Betty to step through,\nthen trailed along with the plastic under his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He caught up and touched helmets again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just act as if you're on business,\" he told her. \"For all anyone can\nsee, we might be inspecting the dome.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are you going?\" asked Betty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right through the wall, and then head for the nearest mine. Jeffers\ncan't be running\n  <i>\n   everything\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is there any way to get to a TV?\" asked the girl. \"I ... uh ... Daddy\ngave me a good number to call if I needed help.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How good?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pretty official, as a matter of fact.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" Tolliver decided. \"We'll try the ship you just came in on.\nThey might have finished refueling and left her empty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had to cross one open lane between buildings, and Tolliver was\nvery conscious of moving figures in the distance; but no one seemed to\nlook their way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reaching the foot of the main dome over the establishment, he glanced\nfurtively about, then plunged his knife into the transparent material.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Betty make a startled\ngesture, but he had his work cut out for him. This was tougher than the\ninterior dome.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, he managed to saw a ragged slit through which they could\nsqueeze. There was room to walk between the inner and outer layer, so\nhe moved along a few yards. A little dust began to blow about where\nthey had gone through. He touched helmets once more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This time,\" he said, \"the air will really start to blow, so get\nthrough as fast as you can. If I can slap this piece of plastic over\nthe rip, it may stow down the loss of pressure enough to give us quite\na lead before the alarms go off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Through the faceplates, he saw the girl nod, wide-eyed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As soon as he plunged the knife into the outer layer, he could see\ndusty, moist air puffing out into the near-vacuum of Ganymede's\nsurface. Fumbling, he cut as fast as he could and shoved Betty through\nthe small opening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Squeezing through in his turn, he left one arm inside to spread the\nplastic sheet as best he could. The internal air pressure slapped it\nagainst the inside of the dome as if glued, although it immediately\nshowed an alarming tendency to balloon through the ruptured spot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   They'll find it, all right\n  </i>\n  , Tolliver reminded himself.\n  <i>\n   Don't be here\nwhen they do!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grabbed Betty by the wrist of her spacesuit and headed for the\nnearest outcropping of rock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It promptly developed that she had something to learn about running on\nice in such low gravity. Until they were out of direct line of sight\nfrom the settlement, Tolliver simply dragged her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, when he decided that it was safe enough to pause and tell her\nhow to manage better, the sight of her outraged scowl through the\nface-plate made him think better of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   By the time we reach the ship, she'll have learned\n  </i>\n  , he consoled\nhimself.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve on\nGanymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forced\nto explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. He\nadmitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached the\nspaceship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsed\nand stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's all right,\" Tolliver told the girl. \"We can get in with no\ntrouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved that\nhe caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at the\nspot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognized\nthe outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tilting\ndownward again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In fact, we\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  to get in to stay out of trouble,\" he said to Betty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He located the switch-cover in the hull, opened it and activated the\nmechanism that swung open the airlock and extended the ladder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took him considerable scrambling to boost the girl up the ladder and\ninside, but he managed. They passed through the airlock, fretting at\nthe time required to seal, pump air and open the inner hatch; and then\nTolliver led the way up another ladder to the control room. It was a\nclumsy trip in their spacesuits, but he wanted to save time.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  In the control room, he shoved the girl into an acceleration seat,\nglanced at the gauges and showed her how to open her helmet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Leave the suit on,\" he ordered, getting in the first word while she\nwas still shaking her head. \"It will help a little on the takeoff.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Takeoff!\" shrilled Betty. \"What do you think you're going to do? I\njust want to use the radio or TV!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut your\nconversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over these\ndials!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of the\nship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into an\neconomy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments,\ndoing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. He\nwarned her the trip might be long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you not to come,\" he said at last. \"Now sit back!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck,\nand then it was out of his hands for several minutes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That wasn't so bad,\" Betty admitted some time later. \"Did you go in\nthe right direction?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who knows?\" retorted Tolliver. \"There wasn't time to check\n  <i>\n   everything\n  </i>\n  . We'll worry about that after we make your call.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh!\" Betty looked helpless. \"It's in my pocket.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver sighed. In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pry\nher out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed any\nfurther help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter.\nWhen Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set about\nmaking contact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitored\nexpectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore a\nuniform.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Space Patrol?\" whispered Tolliver incredulously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right,\" said Betty. \"Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float out\nof range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he stared\nexasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man who\ncould arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede and\nwondering what was behind it all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he heard Betty requesting assistance in arresting Jeffers and\nreporting the manager as the head of a ring of crooks, he began to\nsuspect. He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of the\nPatrolman.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, he\nnever addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted the\nrequest as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who to\ngo down after.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   They really sent her out to nail someone\n  </i>\n  , Tolliver realized.\n  <i>\n   Of\ncourse, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had an\nidea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She might\nhave got me killed!\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We do have one trouble,\" he heard Betty saying. \"This tractor driver,\nTolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but he\nsays it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever they\ncall it. I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of her\nsweater.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Actually, I have a fine idea,\" he informed the officer coldly. \"I\nhappen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control.\nIf Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us later\non this channel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Koslow?\" repeated the spacer. \"Did she tell you—well, no matter!\nIf you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offended\nthan reassured at discovering his status.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This 'Miss Koslow' business,\" he said suspiciously. \"He sounded funny\nabout that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl grinned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Relax, Tolliver,\" she told him. \"Did you really believe Daddy would\nsend his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoever\nwas gypping him?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You ... you...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigating\nfirm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,\"\nTolliver finished for her. \"I guess it's better this way,\" he said\nmeditatively a moment later.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, come\n  <i>\n   on\n  </i>\n  ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we're\ngoing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, so\nwe'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to be\npicked up.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuel\nnecessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Even\nthough the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringing\nalong enough fuel to head back would be something else again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll just have to ride it out,\" he said sympathetically. \"The ship is\nprovisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't expect to so soon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, you were pretty lucky. They'll think you're a marvel to crack\nthe case in about three hours on Ganymede.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Great!\" muttered Betty. \"What a lucky girl I am!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" admitted Tolliver, \"there\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  problems. If you like, we might\nget the captain of that Patrol ship to legalize the situation by TV.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can see you're used to sweeping girls off their feet,\" she commented\nsourly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The main problem is whether you can cook.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Betty frowned at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm pretty good with a pistol,\" she offered, \"or going over crooked\nbooks. But cook? Sorry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, one of us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll think about it,\" promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at the\ndeck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about it\ntoo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   After a while\n  </i>\n  , he promised himself,\n  <i>\n   I'll explain how I cut the fuel\nflow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're just\norbiting Ganymede!\n  </i>\n </p>\n \n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "103", "uid": "8c343deb053741e1aa02ad9c0ef26824", "response_text": "The story begins as Johnny Tolliver argues with Jeffers, the manager of Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways, about how he doesn’t want to be involved with whatever he is doing.

She had the right curves in\nthe right places and would have been beautiful if her nose had been\nsmaller, if her mouth had been larger and if her hair had been wavy\ninstead of straight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hank said you wanted to see me,\" she said when she stopped beside\nJoe's table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah.\" Joe nodded at the other chair. \"Have a seat.\" He reached into a\npocket, withdrew five ten-dollar bills and handed them to her. \"I want\nyou to do a job for me. It'll only take a few minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl counted the money, then placed it in her purse. Joe noticed\na small counterfeit-detector inside the purse before she closed it.\n\"What's the job?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell you later.\" He gulped the remainder of his drink, almost pouring\nit down his throat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey. You trying to make yourself sick?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not sick. Drunk. Been trying to get drunk all afternoon.\" As the\nliquor settled in his stomach, he waited for the warm glow. But the\nglow didn't come ... the bartender had watered his drink again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trying to get drunk?\" the girl inquired. \"Are you crazy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. It's simple. If I get drunk, I can join the AAA and get free room\nand board for a month while they give me a treatment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was easy enough to understand, he reflected, but a lot harder to do.\nThe CPA robot bartenders saw to it that anyone got high if they wanted,\nbut comparatively few got drunk. Each bartender could not only mix\ndrinks but could also judge by a man's actions and speech when he was\non the verge of drunkenness. At the proper time—since drunkenness was\nillegal—a bartender always watered the drinks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe had tried dozens of times in dozens of bars to outsmart them, but\nhad always failed. And in all of New York's millions, there had been\nonly a hundred cases of intoxication during the previous year.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl laughed. \"If you're that hard up, I don't know if I should\ntake this fifty or not. Why don't you go out and get a job like\neveryone else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As an answer, Joe handed her his CPA ID card. She grunted when she\nsaw the large letters that indicated the owner had Dangerous Criminal\nTendencies.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When she handed the card back, Joe fought an impulse to tear it to\npieces. He'd done that once and gone through a mountain of red tape to\nget another—everyone was required by law to carry a CPA ID card and\nshow it upon request.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I didn't know you were a DCT.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And who'll hire a guy with criminal tendencies? You know the score.\nWhen you try to get a job, they ask to see your ID before they even\ntell you if there's an opening or not. If your CPA ID says you're a\nDCT, you're SOL and they tell you there's no openings. Oh, I've had\nseveral jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I've been a garbage man,\nstreet-cleaner, ditch-digger—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and\na group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned\nacross the table and whispered in the girl's ear, \"That's what I\nwant to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get\nconvicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. \"Say! You really got big\nplans, don't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He smiled at her admiration. It\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  something big to plan a crime.\nA civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting,\nblackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA—Crime\nPrevention Association. There were no longer any prisons—CPA officials\nhad declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent\ncrime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of\ningenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime\nalmost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men\nin the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill\nsomeone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; he\nwasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all\ncriminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock\ntreatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and\na dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few\ncriminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city could\nafford the CPA hospitals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because\nit did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with\nprisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And, ironically, a man who\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  commit a crime was a sort of hero. He\nwas a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses\nto kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a\nhero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was—when he left one of the\nCPA hospitals—a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a\nman who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.\nAnd therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatment\nwas commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of the\nword an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" the girl said. \"I'm honored. Really. But I got a date at ten.\nLet's get it over with. You said it'd only take a few minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay. Let's go.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The girl followed him across the room, around tables, through a door,\ndown a hall, through a back door and into the alley.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and ripped\nher blouse and skirt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away,\nher body poised like a wrestler's. \"What's the big idea?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Scream,\" Joe said. \"Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get\nhere, tell 'em I tried to rape you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of the\nfew things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime\nbecause it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the\nintended victim—and because millions of women voters had voted it a\ncrime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc.,\nwere not crimes. They weren't crimes because the DCT didn't complete\nthe act, and if he didn't complete the act, that meant simply that the\nCPA had once again functioned properly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl shook her head vigorously. \"Sorry, buddy. Can't help you that\nway. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's the matter?\" Joe complained. \"I'm not asking you to do anything\nwrong.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You stupid jerk. What do you think this is—the Middle Ages? Don't you\nknow almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I'm a sergeant in\nthe WSDA!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe groaned. The WSDA—Women's Self-Defense Association—a branch of\nthe CPA. The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, even\ndeveloped new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women in\nthose new techniques.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl was still shaking her head. \"Can't do it, buddy. I'd lose my\nrank if you were convicted of—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do I have to\n  <i>\n   make\n  </i>\n  you scream?\" Joe inquired tiredly and advanced\ntoward the girl.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"—and that rank carries a lot of weight. Hey!\n  <i>\n   Stop it!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth when\nshe said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body,\nand in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The alley's concrete floor was hard—it had always been hard, but he\nbecame acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it.\nThere was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautiful\nstars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant police\nsirens. But the wonderful moment didn't last long and darkness closed\nin on him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When he awoke, a rough voice was saying, \"Okay. Snap out of it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened his eyes and recognized the police commissioner's office. It\nwould be hard not to recognize: the room was large, devoid of furniture\nexcept for a desk and chairs, but the walls were lined with the\ncontrols of television screens, electronic calculators and a hundred\nother machines that formed New York's mechanical police force.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Commissioner Hendricks was a remarkable character. There was something\nwrong with his glands, and he was a huge, greasy bulk of a man with\nbushy eyebrows and a double chin. His steel-gray eyes showed something\nof his intelligence and he would have gone far in politics if fate\nhadn't made him so ugly, for more than half the voters who elected men\nto high political positions were women.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone who knew Hendricks well liked him, for he was a friendly,\nlikable person. But the millions of women voters who saw his face on\nposters and on their TV screens saw only the ugly face and heard only\nthe harsh voice. The President of the United States was a capable\nman, but also a very handsome one, and the fact that a man who looked\nsomething like a bulldog had been elected as New York's police\ncommissioner was a credit to Hendricks and millions of women voters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where's the girl?\" Joe asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I processed her while you were out cold. She left. Joe, you—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" Joe said. \"I'll save you the trouble. I admit it. Attempted\nrape. I confess.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks smiled. \"Sorry, Joe. You missed the boat again.\" He reached\nout and turned a dial on his desk top. \"We had a microphone hidden in\nthat alley. We have a lot of microphones hidden in a lot of alleys.\nYou'd be surprised at the number of conspiracies that take place in\nalleys!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe listened numbly to his voice as it came from one of the hundreds of\nmachines on the walls, \"\n  <i>\n   Scream. Scream as loud as you can, and when\nthe cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you.\n  </i>\n  \" And then the girl's\nvoice, \"\n  <i>\n   Sorry, buddy. Can't help—\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waved his hand. \"Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was\nslouched in a chair. \"Give me your CPA ID.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world\nhad collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime.\nAnyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from\ncommitting a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly\nonce again. That meant the CPA had once again\n  <i>\n   prevented\n  </i>\n  crime, and\nthe CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attempt\nto prevent crimes\n  <i>\n   by\n  </i>\n  punishment. If it did, that would be a violation\nof the New Civil Rights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a\nbutton. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words\nDANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before.\nAnd, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a\nDCT First Class.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've graduated,\" Hendricks said coldly. \"You guys never learn, do\nyou? Now you're a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know\nwhat that means?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face.\n\"That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers.\nYou'll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it\nworks? It's like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night\nand they're bored. Then Mr. Jones says, 'Let's go watch this Joe\nHarper.' So they look up your record—amateur cops always keep records\nof First Classes in scrapbooks—and they see that you stop frequently\nat Walt's Tavern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So they go there and they sit and drink and watch you, trying not\nto let you know they're watching you. They watch you all night, just\nhoping you'll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone,\nso they can be the first ones to yell '\n  <i>\n   Police!\n  </i>\n  ' They'll watch you\nbecause it's exciting to be an amateur cop, and if they ever\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  prevent you from committing a crime, they'd get a nice reward and\nthey'd be famous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lay off,\" Joe said. \"I got a headache. That girl—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks leaned even closer and glared. \"You listen, Joe. This is\ninteresting. You see, it doesn't stop with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There's\nthousands of people like them. Years ago, they got their kicks from\nreading about guys like you, but these days things are dull because\nit's rare when anyone commits a crime. So every time you walk down\nthe street, there'll be at least a dozen of 'em following you, and no\nmatter where you go, you can bet there'll be some of 'em sitting next\nto you, standing next to you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"During the day, they'll take your picture with their spy cameras that\nlook like buttons on their coats. At night, they'll peep at you through\nyour keyhole. Your neighbors across the street will watch you through\nbinoculars and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lay off!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Joe squirmed in the chair. He'd been lectured by Hendricks before and\nit was always an unpleasant experience. The huge man was like a talking\nmachine once he got started, a machine that couldn't be stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the kids are the worst,\" Hendricks continued. \"They have Junior\nCPA clubs. They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboard\nboxes. They'll stare at you on the street and stare at you through\nrestaurant windows while you're eating meals. They'll follow you in\npublic rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyes\nwhile they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you look\nback, you'll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half a\nblock behind, giggling and gaping at you. They'll follow you until the\nday you die, because you're a freak!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe couldn't stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and paced\nthe floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And it doesn't end\n  <i>\n   there\n  </i>\n  , Joe. It goes on and on. You'll be the\nobject of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stop\nyou on the street and say, 'I'd like to help you, friend.' Then they'll\nask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you were\na child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT First\nClass?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stop\nyou on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay, goddam it!\n  <i>\n   Stop it!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief\nand lit a cigarette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm trying to explain something you're too\ndumb to realize by yourself. We've taught everyone to hate crime and\ncriminals ... to\n  <i>\n   hate\n  </i>\n  them as nothing has ever been hated before.\nToday a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hell\nif you don't leave New York. You should go to some small town where\nthere aren't many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously. \"\n  <i>\n   Favor\n  </i>\n  , did you say? The day you\ndo\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  a favor—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. \"Not entirely a favor. I\nwant to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and read\nbooks. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I couldn't leave if I wanted to,\" Joe said. \"I'm flat broke. Thanks to\nyour CPA system, a DCT can't get a decent job.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extended\nthem. \"I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back a\nlittle at a time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe waved the money away. \"Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Why\ndon't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me—any\ncrime.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is a\nviolation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Umm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  to\nbe a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all your\ncriminal tendencies and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go to those\n  <i>\n   head-shrinkers\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks shrugged again. \"Have it your way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe laughed. \"If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you\n  <i>\n   make\n  </i>\n  me go?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Violation of Civil Rights.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the same\nthing. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How can I help you without committing a crime myself?\" Hendricks\nwalked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.\n\"See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in New\nYork who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people who\naren't protected properly—blind spots in our protection devices. As\nsoon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,\nbut this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can\nI do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe,\npick a name and go out and rob him.'\" He laughed nervously. \"If I did\nthat, I'd be committing a crime myself!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket\nagain and wiped sweat from his face. \"Excuse me a minute. I'm dying of\nthirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the\nbig man. Hendricks was—unbelievably—offering him a victim, offering\nhim a crime!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name and\naddress and memorized it:\n  <i>\n   John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Hendricks came back, Joe said, \"Thanks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a\nchild, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid\nof the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\nat ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\nown imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\nfeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\nhim to make a mistake.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\nTwenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\nalleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\nfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\nup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they\nwere discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received,\nthe message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\nin two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\nmicrophones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\nto the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\nsomeone's pocket at forty yards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\nstore was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\nof business for years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors—devices\nplaced in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\nheat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\nmade poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\npoison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\nof it would kill a human.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\nsupervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\nof kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\npointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place\nof business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\nthat could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\nof the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\nthat he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\ndifferent: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\ntheir aim was infallible.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was like a fantastic dream come true. Only the dream wasn't\nfantastic any more. With the huge atomic power plants scattered across\nthe country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously\nlow prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power\nrequired to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of\nfour dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of\nthe devices had cost even less.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at\nthe individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked\nsubliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio\nor watching television, if a person heard station identification, he\ninvariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH.\nIf he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters\ndeclaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he\nalways found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit\nanything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and\nheard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his\nsubconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime\nwas the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands\nof other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment\n204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204,\nhe could see that the wall on either side of it was\n  <i>\n   new\n  </i>\n  . That is,\ninstead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls\nwere, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and\nthe owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating\nanother room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by\nlaw, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but\nevidently he didn't want to pay for installation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to\nclose the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the\nbed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at\nnight and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the\ncrime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He broke out in a sweat when he found nothing but underwear and old\nmagazines. If he stole underwear and magazines, it would still be a\ncrime, but the newspapers would splash satirical headlines. Instead of\nbeing respected as a successful criminal, he would be ridiculed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stopped sweating when he found a watch under a pile of underwear.\nThe crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn't run,\nbut—perfection itself—engraved on the back was the inscription,\n  <i>\n   To\nJohn with Love\n  </i>\n  . His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy\nfor the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, \"\n  <i>\n   Thief! Police!\nHelp!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waited a few seconds and then ran. When he reached the street, a\npolice helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him;\ncameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the\nmetal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who\nreported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, \"Hey. Wake up. Hey!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks' ugly face and thought for a minute\nhe was still having the nightmare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I just saw your doctor,\" Hendricks said. \"He says your treatment is\nover. You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to\nthink. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in\nhimself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be an\nafter-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed when\nhe looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months\nand he had, between operations, been locked in his room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back.\nDeliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change:\nBefore, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now,\neven when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred.\nThey had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it\naltogether.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come here and take a look at your public,\" said Hendricks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered\non the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks,\ncameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day.\nBut now—another change in him—\n </p>\n <p>\n  He put the emotion into words: \"I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I\ndon't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hero!\" Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded\nlike a bull snorting. \"You think a successful criminal is a hero? You\nstupid—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. \"You think\nthose people are down there because they admire what you did? They're\ndown there waiting for you because they're curious, because they're\nglad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You're\nan\n  <i>\n   ex\n  </i>\n  -criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never be\nable to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kind\nof guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get\nyour autograph.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did\nunderstand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see\nthe people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer\nand shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero,\n  <i>\n   what was\nhe\n  </i>\n  ?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all\naround him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at\nonce and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered\nsome more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired\nold lady with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank heaven it was only a\nwatch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son.\" And\nthen the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total\nconfusion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone rather\nthan stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd\nwould have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA\nhospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an\nex-murderer came out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled\nhimself with the thought,\n  <i>\n   People are funny. Who can understand 'em?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Feeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned toward\nHendricks and said, \"Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I'll\nbe able to get a good job now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's why I met you at the hospital,\" Hendricks said. \"I want to\nexplain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you're\nspectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself and\nI don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did\nyou a favor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely\nthanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'd\ndone him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You robbed Gralewski's apartment,\" Hendricks said. \"Gralewski is a CPA\nemployee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA pays\nthe rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of places\nlike that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like you\nbefore they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT First\nClass won't take the free psycho treatment or—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, it's still a favor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks' face hardened. \"Favor? You wouldn't know a favor if you\nstumbled over one. I did it because it's standard procedure for your\ntype of case. Anyone can—free of charge—have treatment by the best\npsychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for the\ntreatment and taking it. But you wouldn't do that. You wanted to commit\na crime, get caught and be a hero ... an\n  <i>\n   Ex\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ages\nwere laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPA\npsychologists to relieve tension. And—despite the treatment, Joe\nshuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietly\nwatching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employees\nand volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly\nwatching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies,\nit watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply\nuntil it took you apart and put you back together again the way it\nwanted you to be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted,\" Hendricks\ncontinued. \"You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it.\nYou'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever worked\nbefore in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice in\nyour head is going to say,\n  <i>\n   Work! Work!\n  </i>\n  Exes always get good jobs\nbecause employers know they're good workers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But during these next few days, you'll discover what being an Ex\nis like. You see, Joe, the treatment can't possibly take all the\ncriminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next best\nthing—you'll find a set of laws written in your mind. You might\n  <i>\n   want\n  </i>\n  to break one now and then, but you won't be able. I'll give you an\nillustration....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Joe's face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series of\nnames. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles in\nhis arm froze before it moved it an inch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain so\nintense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed in\nagony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head,\n  <i>\n   Unlawful to\nstrike someone except in self-defense\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him,\nthe CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the pain\nreturned, and the mental voice whispered,\n  <i>\n   Unlawful to curse\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing a\ncrime. And now that he knew, it didn't seem fair. He decided to tell\nthe whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And as soon as\nthat decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned and\nthe voice,\n  <i>\n   Unlawful to divulge CPA procedure\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See what I mean?\" Hendricks asked. \"A century ago, you would have been\nlocked in a prison and taxpayers' money would have supported you until\nthe day you died. With the CPA system, you're returned to society, a\nuseful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you've got a\nbig hand in your dirty little mind that's going to slap it every time\nyou get the wrong kind of thought. It'll keep slapping you until you\nlearn. It might take weeks, months or years, but you'll learn sooner\nor later to not even think about doing anything wrong.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring at the car's plush ceiling.\n\"It's a great system, isn't it, Joe? A true democracy. Even a jerk like\nyou is free to do what he wants, as long as it's legal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think it's a lousy, filthy system.\" Joe's head was still tingling\nwith pain and he felt suffocated. The CPA was everywhere, only now it\nwas also inside his head, telling him he couldn't do this, couldn't do\nthat. All his life it had been telling him he couldn't do things he\nwanted to do and\n  <i>\n   now\n  </i>\n  ....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hendricks laughed. \"You'll change your opinion. We live in a clean,\nwonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people. Except for\nfreaks like yourself, criminals are—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let me out!\" Joe grabbed at the door and was on the sidewalk, slamming\nthe door behind him before the car stopped completely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into\nthe stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a\nprisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated\nhim back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wanted to spit his contempt, but the increasingly familiar pain and\nvoice prevented him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was unlawful to spit on a sidewalk.\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "104", "uid": "4a91673a3a10486c98bb515c6c5eb6b8", "response_text": "Joe is at a bar and hands a girl $50 to complete a task for him without telling her what it is yet. He makes small talk to the girl telling her that he is trying to get drunk but he can’t because his drinks are watered down by the CPA robot bartenders. Joe informs the girl that he is assigned a DCT (Dangerous Criminal Tendencies) designation on his CPA ID card. Joe leads the girl to an alley to move his plan into motion. His plan is for her to say that he attempted to rape her because attempted rape is a crime under CPA rules. The girl states that she does not want to go along with that plan because she will lose her rank in the Women’s Self-Defense Association, which is a branch of the CPA. Joe still persists and tries to make her scream. The girl in turn successfully defends herself against him and causes his head to strike the hard concrete floor. He loses consciousness of her actions. \n\nJoe wakes up in the police commissioner’s office. Joe’s plan does not work because the CPA had microphones monitoring the alley so they already know that the plan was not real. Joe then proceeds to confess to a conspiracy when presented with the evidence the CPA has gathered. As a result of these actions, Joe’s new designation on his CPA ID card has the words ‘Dangerous Criminal Tendencies’ in all caps and in a large, red font printed on his card. It also added that he was a DCT First Class owner. Hendricks lectures Joe about his new designation, but Joe does not care to hear him. The commissioner tries to convince Joe to leave New York or to use the free psychology service. \n\nHendricks explains that he cannot think of a way to help Joe without committing a crime himself. In an unexpected move, Hendricks offers Joe a seemingly available victim and their address. Joe memorizes the available information and goes to the address to commit a crime. Joe enters the apartment and takes a watch. He then shouts outside a window that there is a thief. Joe proceeds to run down to the street and is caught by a police helicopter and handcuffed. \n\nJoe eventually wakes up after months of treatment in a hospital and is picked up by Hendricks. He goes through the large crowd waiting to meet him upon exiting the hospital and has an uneasy feeling about the interactions. He is confused by the reaction of the crowd. Hendrick says that it was a fake apartment that Joe went to and is one that the police use for special cases like his when a person refuses to find a solution. Joe becomes upset because he realizes that he has become a prisoner in his own body because of the treatment from the CPA and he has great contempt for the results. \n"}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "75ccf4b290d648e68cae7a3a6123dd37", "response_text": "A girl goes up to Joe Harper's table in a tavern and says that Hank said that Joe wanted to see her.

The girl wonders why he doesn't just get a job but hands her his CPA ID card. She sees that he has Dangerous Criminal Tendencies, which she then realizes why. The CPA does not punish criminals and focuses more on preventing crime. Therefore, criminals who get convicted are sent to hospitals where all criminal tendencies are removed from the mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, and many other devices. However, these criminals are also hailed as heroes once they have left the treatment program. The girl agrees to his plan, and they go to the alley. He rips her clothes off and tells her to accuse him of rape. However, she cannot agree to the plan because she is a sergeant of the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA).

He further taunts Joe and says that all sorts of people on the street will ask about him and that his life is over because he is a freak. When Joe says that he is broke, Hendricks offers to loan him some money. Although both want to see Joe convicted, Hendricks cannot directly help him because it is either a Violation of Civil Rights or will cause him to commit a crime. However, as soon as Hendricks leaves to get water, Jon flips through Hendricks' book and finds somebody to rob. He goes to John Gralewski's apartment to steal a watch and is arrested promptly by the police. The story then goes to Hendricks telling Jon to wake up and that his treatment is now over. Jon says that he does not feel like a hero, while Hendricks tells him that they only admire him because he will never commit another crime again. When they get inside the car, Hendricks tells Jon that he will have the job he has always wanted now, but the treatment has written a set of laws in his mind that prevents him from committing crimes. Joe now realizes how lousy this system is and wants out of it, but it is too late. He demands to get out of the car and realizes he has become a prisoner with himself.

Joe tells her he is trying to get drunk, but the robot-bartender keeps watering his drink as being drunk is illegal. The plan is to join AAA and to live there for free for a month, but there are clever robots in every bar in New York. The girl suggests finding a job and learns that Joe had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCT), which is visible in his ID card. Joe wants the girl to help him commit a crime which is almost impossible as CPA prevents every crime by various means. Those few who succeed are not punished but given treatment in hospitals after which they become perfect employees wanted by every company. Joe and the girl go out into the alley and the man asks her to scream to make everything look like an attempted rape. Nevertheless, the girl refuses as she was taught self-defense and is a sergeant, a rank she doesn't want to lose. When Joe tries anyway, the girl beats him down and police comes soon. They had a hidden microphone nearby and don't believe in the attempted rape story. Conspiracy is not considered a crime and Joe's ID has a larger DCT inscription now - a first class one. This means more cops will watch him as a hobby, as well as neighbors and other people. Hendricks, the police officer, suggests Joe gets the free treatment and then shows a small book with the contacts of nor properly protected people, listed in order to fix that blind spots. After leaving the book on the table, the officer goest to the nest room to get some water, and leaves Joe with the opportunity. Soon, Joe visits one of the listed apartments, an old building with an unreported new room. Joe steals a watch from there and screams for help, then runs and gets caught. After a while, Joe wakes up from a nightmare and sees Hendricks, who announces the end of treatment. The treatment lasted for months and made Joe feel more relaxed but nothing more. A huge crowd is waiting outside to cheer the ex-criminal for his newly gained honesty and inability to commit crime. A woman in the crowd blesses Joe for not committing a murder, which confuses him, as ex-murderers are even more cheered. Then Hendricks explains that he didn't do Joe a favor but such help in crimes is to prevent huger damages from those who refuse free treatment and want to be Exes, as they see those as heroes. Turns out an Ex has to work harder than other people and they still want to commit crime but the laws sound in their heads and prevent it causing pain. CPA is everywhere.

Those that did commit a crime are considered heroes, and they are not punished because they outsmarted the system. Instead, they will be put in a CPA hospital for treatments. Afterward, they will be provided with some of the most paid jobs. Joe and the girl goes into the alleyway where he attempts to rape her. She tells him that he cannot do this. But he continues because he wants to get the treatment for a nice job. But because the girl refuses to corporate, she hits him and he drops to the ground.

You'll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line ship\nnext—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which gate?\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For ... ah...?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen's Worlds,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" the clerk said. \"Gate 19,\" he added quickly. \"But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare sign\nreading\n  <i>\n   To Gates 16-30\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Another smart alec,\" the clerk said behind him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\ncovered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\nwith a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\ngray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard blinked at it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Whassat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\nsays he's out to lunch.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\nagainst the handrail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\nright into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\nwent to his knees.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\npast while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\nover the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\nalong the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\nThe door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\nfloor. It was expensive looking baggage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\nflorid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\nthe open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\nclamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\nhe backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\nout of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr.\nTony's room.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\nsat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\nthe corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\noversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\nglanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\nout?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\nhandle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\nthe trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\ndoor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\nfar wall of the corridor and burst.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\nface of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mister, you must be—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you'll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\nthe door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Five minutes passed before the door rattled and burst open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked up. A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, a\nblue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eye\nstared at Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is this the joker?\" he grated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted,\n\"That's him, sure.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm captain of this vessel,\" the first man said. \"You've got two\nminutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When you can spare the time from your other duties,\" Retief said,\n\"take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code.\nThat spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged in\ninterplanetary commerce.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A space lawyer.\" The captain turned. \"Throw him out, boys.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go on, pitch him out,\" the captain snapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't try it,\" he said softly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, and\nstepped forward, then hesitated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey,\" he said. \"This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's him,\" the thick-necked man called. \"Spilled Mr. Tony's\npossessions right on the deck.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Deal me out,\" the bouncer said. \"He can stay put as long as he wants\nto. I signed on to move cargo. Let's go, Moe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'd better be getting back to the bridge, Captain,\" Retief said.\n\"We're due to lift in twenty minutes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. The\nCaptain's voice prevailed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"—twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Close the door as you leave,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thick-necked man paused at the door. \"We'll see you when you come\nout.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Four waiters passed Retief's table without stopping. A fifth leaned\nagainst the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform\nand with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male\npassengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional\nglances Retief's way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A panel opened in the wall behind Retief's chair. Bright blue eyes\npeered out from under a white chef's cap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Givin' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Looks like it, old-timer,\" Retief said. \"Maybe I'd better go join the\nskipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see your point.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You set right where you're at, Mister. I'll rustle you up a plate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backed\nup with mushrooms and garlic butter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm Chip,\" the chef said. \"I don't like the Cap'n. You can tell him I\nsaid so. Don't like his friends, either. Don't like them dern Sweaties,\nlook at a man like he was a worm.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip. And you've got the\nright idea on the Soetti, too,\" Retief said. He poured red wine into a\nglass. \"Here's to you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dern right,\" Chip said. \"Dunno who ever thought up broiling 'em.\nSteaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert.\nYou like brandy in yer coffee?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Chip, you're a genius.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Like to see a feller eat,\" Chip said. \"I gotta go now. If you need\nanything, holler.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days to\nJorgensen's Worlds. Then, if Magnan's information was correct,\nthere would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was a\ntemptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. It\nwould be good to know what Jorgensen's Worlds would be up against.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and\ncoffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tony\nand his retainers still sat at the Captain's table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered across\nthe room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took\na cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted\nend in Retief's coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must want to get to Jorgensen's pretty bad,\" the thug said in a\ngrating voice. \"What's your game, hick?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't think I want my coffee,\" he said. He looked at the thug. \"You\ndrink it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thug squinted at Retief. \"A wise hick,\" he began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug's\nface, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thug\nwent down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can take your playmates away now, Tony,\" he said. \"And don't\nbother to come around yourself. You're not funny enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mr. Tony found his voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take him, Marbles!\" he growled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out a\nlong-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief heard the panel open beside him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here you go, Mister,\" Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honed\nfrench knife lay on the sill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks, Chip,\" Retief said. \"I won't need it for these punks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking him\nunder the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistol\nfrom his shoulder holster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Aim that at me, and I'll kill you,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go on, burn him!\" Mr. Tony shouted. Behind him, the captain appeared,\nwhite-faced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Put that away, you!\" he yelled. \"What kind of—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up,\" Mr. Tony said. \"Put it away, Hoany. We'll fix this bum\nlater.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not on this vessel, you won't,\" the captain said shakily. \"I got my\ncharter to consider.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ram your charter,\" Hoany said harshly. \"You won't be needing it long.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Button your floppy mouth, damn you!\" Mr. Tony snapped. He looked at\nthe man on the floor. \"Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump the\nslob.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters came\nup. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The panel opened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I usta be about your size, when I was your age,\" Chip said. \"You\nhandled them pansies right. I wouldn't give 'em the time o' day.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip?\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, Mister. Anything else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll think of something,\" Retief said. \"This is shaping up into one of\nthose long days.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"They don't like me bringing yer meals to you in yer cabin,\" Chip said.\n\"But the cap'n knows I'm the best cook in the Merchant Service. They\nwon't mess with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What has Mr. Tony got on the captain, Chip?\" Retief asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're in some kind o' crooked business together. You want some more\nsmoked turkey?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure. What have they got against my going to Jorgensen's Worlds?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dunno. Hasn't been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I\nsure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was\nyer age.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen's\nWorlds like?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One of 'em's cold as hell and three of 'em's colder. Most o' the\nJorgies live on Svea; that's the least froze up. Man don't enjoy eatin'\nhis own cookin' like he does somebody else's.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's where I'm lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo's the captain got\naboard for Jorgensen's?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Derned if I know. In and out o' there like a grasshopper, ever few\nweeks. Don't never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says.\nDon't know what we even run in there for.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To Alabaster. That's nine days' run in-sector from Jorgensen's. You\nain't got another one of them cigars, have you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Plenty o' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins.\" Chip puffed\nthe cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and\nbrandy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Them Sweaties is what I don't like,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked at him questioningly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin' devils. Skinny legs, like a\nlobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin'\nhead. You can see the pulse beatin' when they get riled.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've never had the pleasure,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You prob'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip\nout. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin'.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I ain't superstitious ner nothin',\" Chip said. \"But I'll be\ntriple-damned if that ain't them boarding us now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door,\naccompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy\nknock shook the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They got to look you over,\" Chip whispered. \"Nosy damn Sweaties.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Unlock it, Chip.\" The chef opened the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come in, damn you,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like\nfeet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set\ncompound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees.\nBehind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien rasped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who's your friend, Captain?\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien said again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I've seen it. You can take it away now.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Don't horse around,\" the captain said. \"This fellow can get mean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The alien brought two tiny arms out from the concealment of the mantle,\nclicked toothed pincers under Retief's nose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Quick, soft one.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain, tell your friend to keep its distance. It looks brittle, and\nI'm tempted to test it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those\nsnappers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Last chance,\" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch\nfrom Retief's eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Show him your papers, you damned fool,\" the captain said hoarsely. \"I\ngot no control over Skaw.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the same\ninstant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alien\nand drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbous\nknee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spattering\nfrom the burst joint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I told you he was brittle,\" Retief said. \"Next time you invite pirates\naboard, don't bother to call.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jesus, what did you do! They'll kill us!\" the captain gasped, staring\nat the figure flopping on the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat,\" Retief said. \"Tell him to pass\nthe word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels in\nTerrestrial space.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey,\" Chip said. \"He's quit kicking.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned close\nand sniffed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's dead.\" The captain stared at Retief. \"We're all dead men,\" he\nsaid. \"These Soetti got no mercy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They won't need it. Tell 'em to sheer off; their fun is over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They got no more emotions than a blue crab—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back.\nWe know their secret now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What secret? I—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be no dumber than you got to, Cap'n,\" Chip said. \"Sweaties die\neasy; that's the secret.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe you got a point,\" the captain said, looking at Retief. \"All they\ngot's a three-man scout. It could work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead alien\ngingerly into the hall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti,\" the captain said, looking back\nfrom the door. \"But I'll be back to see you later.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't scare us, Cap'n,\" Chip said. \"Him and Mr. Tony and all his\ngoons. You hit 'em where they live, that time. They're pals o' these\nSweaties. Runnin' some kind o' crooked racket.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'd better take the captain's advice, Chip. There's no point in your\ngetting involved in my problems.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They'd of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That's\nwhere we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They don't scare me none.\" Chip picked up the tray. \"I'll scout around\na little and see what's goin' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anything\nabout that Skaw feller they'll have to move fast; they won't try\nnothin' close to port.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won't do\nanything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chip looked at Retief. \"You ain't no tourist, Mister. I know that much.\nYou didn't come out here for fun, did you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That,\" Retief said, \"would be a hard one to answer.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  IV\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief awoke at a tap on his door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's me, Mister. Chip.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come on in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The chef entered the room, locking the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You shoulda had that door locked.\" He stood by the door, listening,\nthen turned to Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You want to get to Jorgensen's perty bad, don't you, Mister?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's right, Chip.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. The\nSweaties didn't say nothin'. Didn't even act surprised, just took the\nremains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they call\nMarbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap'n in his cabin and\ntalked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap'n come out and give\nsome orders to the Mate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief sat up and reached for a cigar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He hated Skaw's guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got a\ngun?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A 2mm needler. Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The orders cap'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We're\nby-passin' Jorgensen's Worlds. We'll feel the course change any minute.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out a\nshort-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain's\ncabin?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\ncomes down the passage?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain\nlooked up from his desk, then jumped up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you think you're doing, busting in here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hear you're planning a course change, Captain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've got damn big ears.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think we'd better call in at Jorgensen's.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You do, huh?\" the captain sat down. \"I'm in command of this vessel,\"\nhe said. \"I'm changing course for Alabaster.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wouldn't find it convenient to go to Alabaster,\" Retief said. \"So\njust hold your course for Jorgensen's.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not bloody likely.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your use of the word 'bloody' is interesting, Captain. Don't try to\nchange course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\nthe desk, gripped the captain's wrist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he\neased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\ndrawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You busted it, you—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\nhoods.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't put it over, hick.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\nhe said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\nthe mike and looked up at Retief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\nto sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's\ngoing on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with\na sick friend.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief settled himself in a chair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I'm going to\nstay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer.

I've been tied up every off-duty\nhour since I got here—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't offend the Groaci,\" Miss Meuhl said sharply. \"Consul Whaffle\nwould never have been so rude.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Whaffle left here three months ago,\" Retief said, \"leaving me in\ncharge.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Miss Meuhl said, snapping off the dictyper. \"I'm sure I don't\nknow what excuse I can give the Minister.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind the excuses,\" Retief said. \"Just tell him I won't be\nthere.\" He stood up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you leaving the office?\" Miss Meuhl adjusted her glasses. \"I have\nsome important letters here for your signature.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't recall dictating any letters today, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said,\npulling on a light cape.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"I wrote them for you. They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted\nthem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man,\" Miss Meuhl said stiffly.\n\"He had complete confidence in me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on,\" Retief said, \"I won't\nbe so busy.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"May I ask where you'll be if something comes\nup?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. \"Whatever for?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. \"You've been here on Groac\nfor four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put\nthe present government in power?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sure I haven't pried into—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this\nway about ten years back?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we\n  <i>\n   avoid\n  </i>\n  with the\nGroaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders\nraking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down\nthe fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one\noccasion.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,\ngrilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try\nnever to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Certainly not on Groac.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I'll be back before\nyou close the office.\" Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim\ndisapproval as he closed the door.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The pale-featured Groacian vibrated his throat-bladder in a distressed\nbleat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not to enter the Archives,\" he said in his faint voice. \"The denial of\npermission. The deep regret of the Archivist.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The importance of my task here,\" Retief said, enunciating the glottal\ndialect with difficulty. \"My interest in local history.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The impossibility of access to outworlders. To depart quietly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The necessity that I enter.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The specific instructions of the Archivist.\" The Groacian's voice rose\nto a whisper. \"To insist no longer. To give up this idea!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"OK, Skinny, I know when I'm licked,\" Retief said in Terran. \"To keep\nyour nose clean.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, Retief stood for a moment looking across at the deeply carved\nwindowless stucco facades lining the street, then started off in the\ndirection of the Terrestrial Consulate General. The few Groacians on\nthe street eyed him furtively, veered to avoid him as he passed. Flimsy\nhigh-wheeled ground cars puffed silently along the resilient pavement.\nThe air was clean and cool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the office, Miss Meuhl would be waiting with another list of\ncomplaints.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief studied the carving over the open doorways along the street.\nAn elaborate one picked out in pinkish paint seemed to indicate the\nGroacian equivalent of a bar. Retief went in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Groacian bartender was dispensing clay pots of alcoholic drink from\nthe bar-pit at the center of the room. He looked at Retief and froze in\nmid-motion, a metal tube poised over a waiting pot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To enjoy a cooling drink,\" Retief said in Groacian, squatting down at\nthe edge of the pit. \"To sample a true Groacian beverage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To not enjoy my poor offerings,\" the Groacian mumbled. \"A pain in the\ndigestive sacs; to express regret.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To not worry,\" Retief said, irritated. \"To pour it out and let me\ndecide whether I like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To be grappled in by peace-keepers for poisoning of—foreigners.\" The\nbarkeep looked around for support, found none. The Groaci customers,\neyes elsewhere, were drifting away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To get the lead out,\" Retief said, placing a thick gold-piece in the\ndish provided. \"To shake a tentacle.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The procuring of a cage,\" a thin voice called from the sidelines. \"The\ndisplaying of a freak.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Retief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gesture\nof contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent the\ncreature was drunk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To choke in your upper sac,\" the bartender hissed, extending his eyes\ntoward the drunk. \"To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness,\" the drunk\nwhispered. \"To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece.\" He wavered\ntoward Retief. \"To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you?\" Retief asked, interestedly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder,\" the drunk said. The\nbarkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk,\ntook his arms and helped him to the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To get a cage!\" the drunk shrilled. \"To keep the animals in their own\nstinking place.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've changed my mind,\" Retief said to the bartender. \"To be grateful\nas hell, but to have to hurry off now.\" He followed the drunk out the\ndoor. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief looked\nat the weaving alien.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To begone, freak,\" the Groacian whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To be pals,\" Retief said. \"To be kind to dumb animals.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To not be angry, fragrant native,\" Retief said. \"To permit me to chum\nwith you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To flee before I take a cane to you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To have a drink together—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To not endure such insolence!\" The Groacian advanced toward Retief.\nRetief backed away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To hold hands,\" Retief said. \"To be palsy-walsy—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him,\nhead down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrow\ncrossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local,\nwho followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrow\nalley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the following\nGroacian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian\nfell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose;\nRetief put a foot against his chest and pushed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To not be going anywhere for a few minutes,\" Retief said. \"To stay\nright here and have a nice long talk.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There you are!\" Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. \"There\nare two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast.\" Retief pulled off his\ncape. \"This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the Foreign\nMinistry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind telling\nyou.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments\nindicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered a\ncourteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr.\nConsul,\" the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. \"May I present\nShluh, of the Internal Police?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" Retief said. They resumed their seats. Miss\nMeuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, it's such a pleasure—\" she began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never mind that,\" Retief said. \"These gentlemen didn't come here to\nsip tea today.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So true,\" Fith said. \"Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report,\nMr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it.\" He nodded to the police\nchief.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"One hour ago,\" The Groacian said, \"a Groacian national was brought\nto hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of this\nindividual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a\nforeigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department\nindicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of\nthe Terrestrial Consul.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have you ever heard,\" Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, \"of a\nTerrestrial cruiser, the\n  <i>\n   ISV Terrific\n  </i>\n  , which dropped from sight in\nthis sector nine years ago?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Really!\" Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. \"I wash my hands—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just keep that recorder going,\" Retief snapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll not be a party—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said quietly. \"I'm\ntelling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Meuhl sat down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. \"You reopen an old wound,\nMr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial\nhands—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hogwash,\" Retief said. \"That tune went over with my predecessors, but\nit hits a sour note with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All our efforts,\" Miss Meuhl said, \"to live down that terrible\nepisode! And you—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac\nand sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny\nanswers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left.\nSomewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe—at the most. If they were\ninnocent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"IF!\" Miss Meuhl burst out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If, indeed!\" Fith said, his weak voice trembling. \"I must protest\nyour—\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don't\nthink your story will be good enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you admit—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to\nit.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for\nyour diplomatic immunity, I should do more—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force\npaid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial\ndiplomatic mission.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.\n\"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It\nhas outdone itself—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"—to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief\nsaid. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you've\nvisaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the\ndiplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or\nyour satellite—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Enough!\" Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of\nthis matter—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to do\nthe talking,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't!\" Miss Meuhl gasped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The\nGroaci sat down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years\nback—about nine, I think—there was a little parade held here. Some\ncurious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,\nthey were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the\nstreets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to\ncommunicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the\nparade was over?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\nretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\nmouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\nthroats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\nout for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\nyell....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\nonce.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\nnarco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\nparade.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\nwas no killing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're alive?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what\nfoods—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want\nmore information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship?\nWhat happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the\nbig parade?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...\nTerrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were\nstrange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Guns? No, no guns—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them;\nhelped them to death.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking\nfor them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a\nbrisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close\ncall, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the\nstrange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we\nfelt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships\ncame, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our\nguilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our\nfriendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made\na blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make\namends....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where is the ship?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The ship?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget.\nWhere is it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two Groacians exchanged looks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We wish to show our contrition,\" Fith said. \"We will show you the\nship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said. \"If I don't come back in a reasonable length\nof time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed.\" He\nstood, looked at the Groaci.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go,\" he said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Retief stooped under the heavy timbers shoring the entry to the cavern.\nHe peered into the gloom at the curving flank of the space-burned hull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Any lights in here?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Groacian threw a switch. A weak bluish glow sprang up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief walked along the raised wooden catwalk, studying the ship. Empty\nemplacements gaped below lensless scanner eyes. Littered decking was\nvisible within the half-open entry port. Near the bow the words 'IVS\nTerrific B7 New Terra' were lettered in bright chrome duralloy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How did you get it in here?\" Retief asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was hauled here from the landing point, some nine miles distant,\"\nFith said, his voice thinner than ever. \"This is a natural crevasse.\nThe vessel was lowered into it and roofed over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How did you shield it so the detectors didn't pick it up?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All here is high-grade iron ore,\" Fith said, waving a member. \"Great\nveins of almost pure metal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief grunted. \"Let's go inside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shluh came forward with a hand-lamp. The party entered the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief clambered up a narrow companionway, glanced around the interior\nof the control compartment. Dust was thick on the deck, the stanchions\nwhere acceleration couches had been mounted, the empty instrument\npanels, the litter of sheared bolts, scraps of wire and paper. A thin\nfrosting of rust dulled the exposed metal where cutting torches had\nsliced away heavy shielding. There was a faint odor of stale bedding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The cargo compartment—\" Shluh began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've seen enough,\" Retief said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silently, the Groacians led the way back out through the tunnel and\ninto the late afternoon sunshine. As they climbed the slope to the\nsteam car, Fith came to Retief's side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Indeed, I hope that this will be the end of this unfortunate affair,\"\nhe said. \"Now that all has been fully and honestly shown—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can skip all that,\" Retief said. \"You're nine years late. The\ncrew was still alive when the task force called, I imagine. You killed\nthem—or let them die—rather than take the chance of admitting what\nyou'd done.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We were at fault,\" Fith said abjectly. \"Now we wish only friendship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The\n  <i>\n   Terrific\n  </i>\n  was a heavy cruiser, about twenty thousand tons.\"\nRetief looked grimly at the slender Foreign Office official. \"Where is\nshe, Fith? I won't settle for a hundred-ton lifeboat.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Fith erected his eye stalks so violently that one eye-shield fell off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know nothing of ... of....\" He stopped. His throat vibrated rapidly\nas he struggled for calm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My government can entertain no further accusations, Mr. Consul,\"\nhe said at last. \"I have been completely candid with you, I have\noverlooked your probing into matters not properly within your sphere of\nresponsibility. My patience is at an end.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where is that ship?\" Retief rapped out. \"You never learn, do you?\nYou're still convinced you can hide the whole thing and forget it. I'm\ntelling you you can't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We return to the city now,\" Fith said. \"I can do no more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can and you will, Fith,\" Retief said. \"I intend to get to the\ntruth of this matter.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fith spoke to Shluh in rapid Groacian. The police chief gestured to his\nfour armed constables. They moved to ring Retief in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief eyed Fith. \"Don't try it,\" he said. \"You'll just get yourself in\ndeeper.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fith clacked his mandibles angrily, eye stalks canted aggressively\ntoward the Terrestrial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out of deference to your diplomatic status, Terrestrial, I shall\nignore your insulting remarks,\" Fith said in his reedy voice. \"Let us\nnow return to the city.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Retief looked at the four policemen. \"I see your point,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fith followed him into the car, sat rigidly at the far end of the seat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I advise you to remain very close to your consulate,\" Fith said. \"I\nadvise you to dismiss these fancies from your mind, and to enjoy the\ncultural aspects of life at Groac. Especially, I should not venture out\nof the city, or appear overly curious about matters of concern only to\nthe Groacian government.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the front seat, Shluh looked straight ahead. The loosely-sprung\nvehicle bobbed and swayed along the narrow highway. Retief listened to\nthe rhythmic puffing of the motor and said nothing.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said, \"I want you to listen carefully to what I'm\ngoing to tell you. I have to move rapidly now, to catch the Groaci off\nguard.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about,\" Miss Meuhl snapped,\nher eyes sharp behind the heavy lenses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you'll listen, you may find out,\" Retief said. \"I have no time\nto waste, Miss Meuhl. They won't be expecting an immediate move—I\nhope—and that may give me the latitude I need.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're still determined to make an issue of that incident!\" Miss\nMeuhl snorted. \"I really can hardly blame the Groaci. They are not a\nsophisticated race; they had never before met aliens.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're ready to forgive a great deal, Miss Meuhl. But it's not what\nhappened nine years ago I'm concerned with. It's what's happening now.\nI've told you that it was only a lifeboat the Groaci have hidden out.\nDon't you understand the implication? That vessel couldn't have come\nfar. The cruiser itself must be somewhere near by. I want to know\nwhere!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Groaci don't know. They're a very cultured, gentle people. You can\ndo irreparable harm to the reputation of Terrestrials if you insist—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's my decision,\" Retief said. \"I have a job to do and we're\nwasting time.\" He crossed the room to his desk, opened a drawer and\ntook out a slim-barreled needler.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This office is being watched. Not very efficiently, if I know the\nGroaci. I think I can get past them all right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are you going with ... that?\" Miss Meuhl stared at the needler.\n\"What in the world—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Groaci won't waste any time destroying every piece of paper in\ntheir files relating to this thing. I have to get what I need before\nit's too late.

His administrative assistant, Miss Yolanda Meuhl, wants him to attend Groacian cultural events, but Retief is more interested in addressing the nine-year-old mystery of the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific--an event which was followed by a coup d'etat enacted by the current Groacian government. Much to Miss Meuhl's dismay, Retief shirks his cultural duties and makes his way to the Foreign Office Archives, whereupon he is promptly barred from entering by a pale-featured Archivist speaking in the throat-bladder vibrations of the native Groacians. Because of the Archivist's insistence that \"outworlders\" cannot access the archives, Retief begins walking back to the Consulate and stops at a bar for a drink. At the, a drunken Groacian approaches Retief and threatens to cage him and put him on display as a freak. The bartender orders the drunken Groacian out of the bar, and Retief follows him, ultimately beating him up for information. When Retief returns to the Consulate, Miss Meuhl informs him that two angry Groaci await him in his office. One is Fith, an employee of the Terrestrial Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the other is Shluh, a representative of the Internal Police. They are there to investigate reports that Retief has assaulted a Groacian national--an accusation Retief ignores in order to launch into his own accusations that the Groaci were engaged in a cover-up of the whereabouts of the ISV Terrific. Miss Meuhl continually interjects, expresses horror at Retief's claims, and apologizes to the Groacians on behalf of the Terrestrial Consulate. Despite the persistent denials of the Groacians, Retief continues his accusations, suggesting the coup d'etat was an effort to silence government officials with knowledge of the truth of what happened to the cruiser and its crew. Then he reveals what he discovered from the drunken Groacian: The crew of the ISV Terrific had been caged and paraded through the streets of Groac and then neglected until they died. Fith and Shluh finally admit the truth and offer to show Retief the hidden cruiser in order to show their contrition. When Retief sees the ship, he once again accuses the Groacians of attempting to mislead him, saying that this is a lifeboat, and he demands to see the actual ship. Fith has had enough and threatens to arrest Retief, who yields and goes back to the Consulate. There, Miss Meuhl is at her wits end.

Retief wants to learn more about the Terrestrial cruiser, Terrific ISV, that crashed on Groac nine years ago. Miss Meuhl disapproves and believes the Groacian side of the story, but Retief is not convinced. He is turned down at the Archies, as he is an outsider. He leaves and decides to visit a bar and try the local drink. There, Retief is refused by the bartender as well, claiming his stomach can’t handle their drink. A drunk Groacian in the background whispers about putting Retief in a cage where he belongs. He follows the drunk after he gets thrown out and violently interrogates him.\nWhen Retief returns to his office, Miss Meuhl announces that there are two Groaci waiting for him. Fith and Shluh, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Internal Police respectively, have heard about the assaults on a Groacian. Retief asks Miss Meuhl to record their conversation. Retief admits to his questioning, but not before doing some of his own. He prods the two Groaci about the Terrific ISV cruiser and soon reveals that the drunk told him about the zoo-like parade of Terrestrials. Fith admits to the parade and tells them that the Terrestrials died afterward due to insufficient nutrition. The Groaci hid their blunder and lied to the Terrestrials about what truly happened. Retief asks them to take him to the cruiser, which they do. After they explore a little, Fith and Shluh ask him to keep his mouth shut. Retief refuses and says that this ship was the lifeboat, not the cruiser itself.

He also questions the coup d'etat of the present government and the disappearance of the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, nine years ago, which are considered topics to be avoided by Miss Meuhl.

Retief has Miss Meuhl officially record the conversation and pivots to ask what happened to the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, that disappeared nine years ago. Fith is offended and calls for Retief to be fired. Retief presses on to ask why the government fell after the visit of a Terrestrial investigation task force after the incident. He notices the Groacians are covering something up - not letting Terrestrials have social contacts outside the diplomatic circle and never speaking of a parade of six Terrestrials hauled through the streets after the vessel disappeared. Fith admits that six Terrans were captured and they fell ill and died because the Groacians didn’t know what to feed them. Fith admits the ship descended intact East of the city, and that they didn’t realize they had done something terrible until the Terran warships came. So they covered their mistake, purging their guilty leaders, concealing what happened, and offering Terrans diplomatic relations.

She has been working in the consulate for four years and considers herself much more knowledgeable than Retief. There was a Terrestrial ship, the ISV Terrific, that went missing in their sector nine years ago, and while the Terrestrials held an investigation and questioned the Groacians, they did not get satisfactory answers.

Later, two government men, Fith from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh from the Internal Police, show up at the consulate to question Retief about the beating. He turns their questioning into his own interrogation about the missing ship from nine years ago and the reason for the change in their government right after the investigators left Groac. Retief confronts them with his knowledge that the Terrestrials were put in cages and paraded through the streets and demands to know what happened to them. Fith admits this happened and claims the humans grew ill and died since the Groacians didn’t really know how to keep them alive.\nFith also relates that the government was changed after the inquiry to get rid of the leaders who were involved.

Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business\nin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump\nfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray\nwas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections—not that there were\nany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings\nwere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth\nangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon\nstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the\nlocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had\ndone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel\nand Saiph ... it happened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a\ncollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes\nand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something\nthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered\nhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled\ndangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right\nthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched\nit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not\nquite utter silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something\nlike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as\nstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Probably it was only an illusion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get\nfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on\n  <i>\n   Starship Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  to\nthis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to\nhurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in\nexasperation: \"If I could only\n  <i>\n   see\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like\nbaker's dough, not at all resilient.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He\nwas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was, he saw in a moment, not armor but a spacesuit. But what was the\nlight? And what were these other things in the room?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like\nhaving tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was\nlooking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could\nsee made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could construct\na logical explanation for that with no trouble—maybe a subspace\nmeteorite striking the\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  , an explosion, himself knocked\nout, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more\nholes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How to explain a set of Gibbon's\n  <i>\n   Decline and Fall of the Roman\nEmpire?\n  </i>\n  A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the\nchemistry set—or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric\nthat, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing\nsuit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of\nthe objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair—why,\nhe'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old\nenough to go to school. But what were they doing here?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were\nstrange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were\nnot papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made\nof some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or\nprocessed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light.\nBut they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"—the color of aged\ndriftwood or unbleached cloth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth\nwall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings;\nfrom them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be\nventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse\nthan what he already had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a\nlittle light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his\ncourage flowed back when he could see again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago—subjectively it\nseemed to be minutes—he had been aboard the\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  with\nnothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting\none of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being\nshaken up and—he admitted it—scared damn near witless, he did not\nseem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much what\nhad happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been\nan accident to the\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a\ncooling brain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow\nrefreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head\nhe remembered what a spacesuit was good for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It held a radio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest\nof the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he\nsaid, \"calling the\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling\n  <i>\n   Jodrell\nBank\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there was no answer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio,\nsomething more than a million times faster than light, with a range\nmeasured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer,\nhe was a good long way from anywhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, the thing might not be operating.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached for the microphone again—\n </p>\n <p>\n  He cried aloud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than\nbefore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped\nhis eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in\nthe pinkish glimmer; but the hand—his own hand, cupped to hold the\nmicrophone—he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting\nmoment of study, his chest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  II\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone else could.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination\nof a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new\nantibiotic—and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked,\nsailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that\n  <i>\n   may\n  </i>\n  contain food.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\")\nHatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but\nit did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in\nany way look like a human being, but they had features in common.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance,\nthey might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an\nadventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences\nof his culture. Both enjoyed games—McCray baseball, poker and\nthree-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human\ndescription. Both held positions of some importance—considering their\nages—in the affairs of their respective worlds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot,\nhard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were\nnot organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which\nobeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes\ncurl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well\na yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested\nin the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater\ndistances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of\nInverse Squares.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\"\nwhich had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little\nexcited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on\nvarious errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest\nlimbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a\nstate of violent commotion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The probe team had had a shock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the\nothers mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the\nspecimen from Earth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.\n\"Incredible—but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report. Watch\nhim,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to\nwatch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of\nthem could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of\na creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as\nHerrell McCray.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hatcher hurried through the halls of the great buried structure in\nwhich he worked, toward the place where the supervising council of all\nprobes would be in permanent session. They admitted him at once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher identified himself and gave a quick, concise report:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The subject recovered consciousness a short time ago and began to\ninspect his enclosure. His method of doing so was to put his own\nmembers in physical contact with the various objects in the enclosure.\nAfter observing him do this for a time we concluded he might be unable\nto see and so we illuminated his field of vision for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This appeared to work well for a time. He seemed relatively\nundisturbed. However, he then reverted to physical-contact,\nmanipulating certain appurtenances of an artificial skin we had\nprovided for him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He then began to vibrate the atmosphere by means of resonating organs\nin his breathing passage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Simultaneously, the object he was holding, attached to the artificial\nskin, was discovered to be generating paranormal forces.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The supervising council rocked with excitement. \"You're sure?\" demanded\none of the councilmen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. The staff is preparing a technical description of the forces\nnow, but I can say that they are electromagnetic vibrations modulating\na carrier wave of very high speed, and in turn modulated by the\nvibrations of the atmosphere caused by the subject's own breathing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fantastic,\" breathed the councillor, in a tone of dawning hope. \"How\nabout communicating with him, Hatcher? Any progress?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; but\nwe thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting. It\nwas not really a waste of time for him; with the organs he had left in\nthe probe-team room, he was in fairly close touch with what was going\non—knew that McCray was once again fumbling among the objects in the\ndark, knew that the team-members had tried illuminating the room for\nhim briefly and again produced the rising panic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted to get back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop fidgeting,\" commanded the council leader abruptly. \"Hatcher, you\nare to establish communication at once.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, sir....\" Hatcher swung closer, his thick skin quivering slightly;\nhe would have gestured if he had brought members with him to gesture\nwith. \"We've done everything we dare. We've made the place homey\nfor him—\" actually, what he said was more like,\n  <i>\n   we've warmed the\nbiophysical nuances of his enclosure\n  </i>\n  —\"and tried to guess his needs;\nand we're frightening him half to death. We\n  <i>\n   can't\n  </i>\n  go faster. This\ncreature is in no way similar to us, you know. He relies on paranormal\nforces—heat, light, kinetic energy—for his life. His chemistry is not\nours, his processes of thought are not ours, his entire organism is\ncloser to the inanimate rocks of a sea-bottom than to ourselves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Understood, Hatcher. In your first report you stated these creatures\nwere intelligent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir. But not in our way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But in\n  <i>\n   a\n  </i>\n  way, and you must learn that way. I know.\" One lobster-claw\nshaped member drifted close to the councillor's body and raised itself\nin an admonitory gesture. \"You want time. But we don't have time,\nHatcher. Yours is not the only probe team working. The Central Masses\nteam has just turned in a most alarming report.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Have they secured a subject?\" Hatcher demanded jealously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The councillor paused. \"Worse than that, Hatcher. I am afraid their\nsubjects have secured one of them. One of them is missing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a moment's silence. Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. The\ncouncil room was like a tableau in a museum until the councillor spoke\nagain, each council member poised over his locus-point, his members\ndrifting about him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally the councillor said, \"I speak for all of us, I think. If the\nOld Ones have seized one of our probers our time margin is considerably\nnarrowed. Indeed, we may not have any time at all. You must do\neverything you can to establish communication with your subject.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But the danger to the specimen—\" Hatcher protested automatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"—is no greater,\" said the councillor, \"than the danger to every one\nof us if we do not find allies\n  <i>\n   now\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had a\nreputation for demanding results at any cost—even at the cost of\ndestroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannot\nbe said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathy\nthat caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward\ncommunication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting\nphysical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But\nHatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough\ngetting him here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of\nhis team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he\ntook time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not\nentirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his\nbody opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which\nHatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the\neating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture\nof kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for\nanother day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He returned quickly to the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers\nreported—nothing new—and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the\ncouncil. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his\nstaff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but\ndecided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other\nhand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was\nnot lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat\nof the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical\nbeings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in\nages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and\nhiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it—with\nits population—as a decoy, had they arrived at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near\nthe spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they\nhad begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of\nfleeing again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their\nexistence to their enemies—\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hatcher!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his\nsecond in command, very excited. \"What is it?\" Hatcher demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something\nwas about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to\nhim for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted\nthemselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into\nhis own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had\njust taken.... \"Now!\" cried the assistant. \"Look!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an image\nwas forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a\ncathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to\nshow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher was startled. \"Another one! And—is it a different species? Or\nmerely a different sex?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Study the probe for yourself,\" the assistant invited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.\n\"No matter,\" he said at last. \"Bring the other one in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then, in a completely different mood, \"We may need him badly. We\nmay be in the process of killing our first one now.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Killing him, Hatcher?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like\npuppies dislodged from suck. \"Council's orders,\" he said. \"We've got to\ngo into Stage Two of the project at once.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  III\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,\nhe had an inspiration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been\nand groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to\nhave. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed\nit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything—even\nhimself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that\npinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now\nthat he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects\non some strange property of the light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm and\nalmost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was\ngone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had\nhardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,\nperhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very\nfaint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no\nchange.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell\none. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger\nnow. He stood there, perplexed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,\namazement in its tone, \"McCray, is that you? Where the devil are you\ncalling from?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. \"This\nis Herrell McCray,\" he cried. \"I'm in a room of some sort, apparently\non a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"McCray!\" cried the tiny voice in his ear. \"Where are you? This is\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  calling. Answer, please!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\n  <i>\n   am\n  </i>\n  answering, damn it,\" he roared. \"What took you so long?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Herrell McCray,\" droned the tiny voice in his ear, \"Herrell McCray,\nHerrell McCray, this is\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  responding to your message,\nacknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It kept on, and on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they\ndidn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or—no.\nThat was not it; they\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  heard him, because they were responding.\nBut it seemed to take them so long....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his\nmind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was\nit he called them? Two hours ago? Three?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Did that mean—did it\n  <i>\n   possibly\n  </i>\n  mean—that there was a lag of an hour\nor two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his\nsuit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took\n  <i>\n   hours\n  </i>\n  to get a message to the ship and back?\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Herrell McCray was a navigator, which is to say, a man who has learned\nto trust the evidence of mathematics and instrument readings beyond the\nguesses of his \"common sense.\" When\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  , hurtling faster\nthan light in its voyage between stars, made its regular position\ncheck, common sense was a liar. Light bore false witness. The line of\nsight was trustworthy directly forward and directly after—sometimes\nnot even then—and it took computers, sensing their data through\ninstruments, to comprehend a star bearing and convert three fixes into\na position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the evidence of his radio contradicted common sense, common sense\nwas wrong. Perhaps it was impossible to believe what the radio's\nmessage implied; but it was not necessary to \"believe,\" only to act.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray thumbed down the transmitter button and gave a concise report\nof his situation and his guesses. \"I don't know how I got here. I\ndon't know how long I've been gone, since I was unconscious for a\ntime. However, if the transmission lag is a reliable indication—\" he\nswallowed and went on—\"I'd estimate I am something more than five\nhundred light-years away from you at this moment. That's all I have to\nsay, except for one more word: Help.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned sourly and released the button. The message was on its way,\nand it would be hours before he could have a reply. Therefore he had to\nconsider what to do next.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He mopped his brow. With the droning, repetitious call from the ship\nfinally quiet, the room was quiet again. And warm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Very warm, he thought tardily; and more than that. The halogen stench\nwas strong in his nostrils again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hurriedly McCray scrambled into the suit. By the time he was sealed\ndown he was coughing from the bottom of his lungs, deep, tearing rasps\nthat pained him, uncontrollable. Chlorine or fluorine, one of them was\nin the air he had been breathing. He could not guess where it had come\nfrom; but it was ripping his lungs out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He flushed the interior of the suit out with a reckless disregard for\nthe wastage of his air reserve, holding his breath as much as he could,\ndaring only shallow gasps that made him retch and gag. After a long\ntime he could breathe, though his eyes were spilling tears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could see the fumes in the room now. The heat was building up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Automatically—now that he had put it on and so started its\nservo-circuits operating—the suit was cooling him. This was a\ndeep-space suit, regulation garb when going outside the pressure hull\nof an FTL ship. It was good up to at least five hundred degrees in thin\nair, perhaps three or four hundred in dense. In thin air or in space it\nwas the elastic joints and couplings that depolymerized when the heat\ngrew too great; in dense air, with conduction pouring energy in faster\nthan the cooling coils could suck it out and hurl it away, it was the\nrefrigerating equipment that broke down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray had no way of knowing just how hot it was going to get. Nor,\nfor that matter, had the suit been designed to operate in a corrosive\nmedium.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All in all it was time for him to do something.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Among the debris on the floor, he remembered, was a five-foot space-ax,\ntungsten-steel blade and springy aluminum shaft.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray caught it up and headed for the door. It felt good in his\ngauntlets, a rewarding weight; any weapon straightens the back of the\nman who holds it, and McCray was grateful for this one. With something\nconcrete to do he could postpone questioning. Never mind why he had\nbeen brought here; never mind how. Never mind what he would, or could,\ndo next; all those questions could recede into the background of his\nmind while he swung the ax and battered his way out of this poisoned\noven.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Crash-clang!\n  </i>\n  The double jolt ran up the shaft of the ax, through his\ngauntlets and into his arm; but he was making progress, he could see\nthe plastic—or whatever it was—of the door. It was chipping out. Not\neasily, very reluctantly; but flaking out in chips that left a white\npowdery residue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At this rate, he thought grimly, he would be an hour getting through\nit. Did he have an hour?\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it did not take an hour. One blow was luckier than the rest; it\nmust have snapped the lock mechanism. The door shook and slid ajar.\nMcCray got the thin of the blade into the crack and pried it wide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was in another room, maybe a hall, large and bare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray put the broad of his back against the broken door and pressed it\nas nearly closed as he could; it might not keep the gas and heat out,\nbut it would retard them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The room was again unlighted—at least to McCray's eyes. There was not\neven that pink pseudo-light that had baffled him; here was nothing\nbut the beam of his suit lamp. What it showed was cryptic. There were\nevidences of use: shelves, boxy contraptions that might have been\ncupboards, crude level surfaces attached to the walls that might have\nbeen workbenches. Yet they were queerly contrived, for it was not\npossible to guess from them much about the creatures who used them.\nSome were near the floor, some at waist height, some even suspended\nfrom the ceiling itself. A man would need a ladder to work at these\nbenches and McCray, staring, thought briefly of many-armed blind giants\nor shapeless huge intelligent amoebae, and felt the skin prickle at the\nback of his neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tapped half-heartedly at one of the closed cupboards, and was not\nsurprised when it proved as refractory as the door. Undoubtedly he\ncould batter it open, but it was not likely that much would be left of\nits contents when he was through; and there was the question of time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches.\nMetallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a\nstiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar. They were, he\nthought, very much like the parts of a bullet-gun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, they were. He could recognize barrel, chamber, trigger, even\na couple of cartridges, neatly opened and the grains of powder stacked\nbeside them. It was an older, clumsier model than the kind he had seen\nin survival locker, on the\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  —and abruptly wished he were\ncarrying now—but it was a pistol. Another trophy, like the strange\nassortment in the other room? He could not guess. But the others had\nbeen more familiar; they all have come from his own ship. He was\nprepared to swear that nothing like this antique had been aboard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The drone began again in his ear, as it had at five-minute intervals\nall along:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank\n  </i>\n  calling Herrell McCray....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And louder, blaring, then fading to normal volume as the AVC circuits\ntoned the signal down, another voice. A woman's voice, crying out in\npanic and fear: \"\n  <i>\n   Jodrell Bank!\n  </i>\n  Where are you? Help!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph2\">\n  IV\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher's second in command said: \"He has got through the first\nsurvival test. In fact, he broke his way out! What next?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait!\" Hatcher ordered sharply. He was watching the new specimen and\na troublesome thought had occurred to him. The new one was female and\nseemed to be in pain; but it was not the pain that disturbed Hatcher,\nit was something far more immediate to his interests.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that they are in contact.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His assistant vibrated startlement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know,\" Hatcher said, \"but watch. Do you see? He is going straight\ntoward her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher, who was not human, did not possess truly human emotions; but\nhe did feel amazement when he was amazed, and fear when there was\ncause to be afraid. These specimens, obtained with so much difficulty,\nneeded so badly, were his responsibility. He knew the issues involved\nmuch better than any of his helpers. They could only be surprised at\nthe queer antics of the aliens with attached limbs and strange powers.\nHatcher knew that this was not a freak show, but a matter of life and\ndeath. He said, musing:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This new one, I cannot communicate with her, but I get—almost—a\nwhisper, now and then. The first one, the male, nothing. But this\nfemale is perhaps not quite mute.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then shall we abandon him and work with her, forgetting the first one?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hatcher hesitated. \"No,\" he said at last. \"The male is responding well.\nRemember that when last this experiment was done every subject died; he\nis alive at least. But I am wondering. We can't quite communicate with\nthe female—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I'm not sure that others can't.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The woman's voice was at such close range that McCray's suit radio made\na useful RDF set. He located her direction easily enough, shielding the\ntiny built-in antenna with the tungsten-steel blade of the ax, while\nshe begged him to hurry. Her voice was heavily accented, with some\nwords in a language he did not recognize. She seemed to be in shock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray was hardly surprised at that; he had been close enough to shock\nhimself. He tried to reassure her as he searched for a way out of the\nhall, but in the middle of a word her voice stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He hesitated, hefting the ax, glancing back at the way he had come.\nThere had to be a way out, even if it meant chopping through a wall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he turned around again there was a door. It was oddly shaped and\nunlike the door he had hewn through, but clearly a door all the same,\nand it was open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  McCray regarded it grimly. He went back in his memory with meticulous\ncare. Had he not looked at, this very spot a matter of moments before?\nHe had. And had there been an open door then? There had not. There\nhadn't been even a shadowy outline of the three-sided, uneven opening\nthat stood there now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still, it led in the proper direction. McCray added one more\ninexplicable fact to his file and walked through. He was in another\nhall—or tunnel—rising quite steeply to the right. By his reckoning it\nwas the proper direction. He labored up it, sweating under the weight\nof the suit, and found another open door, this one round, and behind\nit—\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, there was the woman whose voice he had heard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a woman, all right. The voice had been so strained that he\nhadn't been positive. Even now, short black hair might not have proved\nit, and she was lying face down but the waist and hips were a woman's,\neven though she wore a bulky, quilted suit of coveralls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knelt beside her and gently turned her face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was unconscious. Broad, dark face, with no make-up; she was\napparently in her late thirties. She appeared to be Chinese.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She breathed, a little raggedly but without visible discomfort; her\nface was relaxed as though she were sleeping. She did not rouse as he\nmoved her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He realized she was breathing the air of the room they were in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His instant first thought was that she was in danger of asphyxiation;", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "8", "uid": "c1a34c92350d4698856691522c2e20d6", "response_text": "Herrell McCray is a navigator on the Starship Jodrell Bank heading for the colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine when he is inexplicably abducted from his ship.

He sees many familiar objects including a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a girl's bathing suit, and more; he wonders how he got there and why such objects are there with him. Three of the room's walls are made of a hard, organic compound, and from grates comprising the fourth wall pours a pungent air.

When he remembers spacesuits come with radios, he tries contacting the ship to no avail and realizes he must be many lightyears away. Then, with sudden horror, he realizes that he cannot see his own body, and the room goes dark again. Outside the room, an alien named \"Hatcher\" runs a probe team tasked with observing McCray and running experiments on him in order to develop an understanding of the human species. Their \"probes\" are mandibles that can attach and detach from their round, jelly-like bodies and run errands and conduct scientific research. Hatcher makes his way to the supervising council of all probes to report the team's findings that McCray displayed \"paranormal powers\" when using his radio to establish contact with his ship. The council urges Hatcher to continue his studies with haste because a member of The Central Masses probe team has been captured by the Old Ones, an ancient species hostile to Hatcher's people. His team must put McCray through a series of tests in order to help them potentially discover a way to defend themselves against the Old Ones. As Hatcher considers the best way to establish communication with McCray without causing him harm, his assistant alerts him to the presence of a female human on the viewing console. Hatcher orders the assistant to bring her in as they may need another human in case McCray dies. Hours after his initial transmission was sent to the ship, McCray receives a response from the ship. He dispatches another transmission and begins to notice the room getting hotter as the air grows more toxic. Hatcher has started the survival portion of the test. McCray uses an ax to break his way out of the room and enters another dark room full of desks he assumes are some kind of workspaces for his captors. Suddenly, he hears a woman's voice crying out for the Jodrell Bank and makes his way toward her.

Some he recognizes from his early life, like a childhood rocking chair. He calls for help on the ultrawave radio of the spacesuit, but there is no answer, telling him he is a long way from anything since the range of the radio is hundreds of light-years.

They are now desperate to find ways to fight or escape them.\nBack in McCray’s observation room, he hears a faint voice responding from his ship via the spacesuit radio. This gives him hope, but also panic because he calculates that he must be more than five hundred light-years away from his ship for such a long lag.

They have tried working with other humans in the past, but they have all died during the stages of their tests.\n\tThe probe team acquires another test subject, a female, who begins calling out for help. McCray hears her and begins making his way to her. She is unconscious when he finds her, and he suspects that it is from breathing the air in the building. The aliens have not communicated with her either, yet, but believe they are beginning to establish the start of communication.

One of the three walls is made up of an organic plastic compound, but the rest are impenetrable. He sees a spacesuit and uses its microphone to emit a distress signal to Jodrell Bank. He hears nothing in response, meaning he must be hundreds of light-years away from them. Suddenly, the light goes out, but not before he realized he couldn’t see his reflection in the spacesuit. As he freaks out, the reader is introduced to Hatcher, the lead alien probe of the team observing Herrel. He and his probe team believe that Hatcher has paranormal powers because he differs so greatly from their blob-like race. Hatcher reports back to the supervising council and informs them of the Earthman’s doings, specifically his ability to speak through his throat. They order him to establish communication quickly, since the Central Masses Team just sent out the message that one of their probes is missing, presumably killed by their test subject. Hatcher thinks they’re moving too fast since their previous subjects didn’t survive. He goes to the eating room, removes his previous day’s digested food from his slit, and puts in new vegetation. His assistant sends him an image telepathically of another human, this time a woman, that they had just captured. Hatcher informs his team they must move into Stage Two. Herrell hears a click, feels the room get warmer, and smells something unpleasant. He turns on the light in the spacesuit and is relieved to see his body. Jodrell Bank calls him back, so he sends in a long message explaining his situation. He hears nothing back. He climbs into the spacesuit, realizing the air is toxic, and lets the spacesuit provide fresh air. He grabs an ax off the floor and uses it to break out of the poisonous room. Once out, he tries to open a cupboard in the new area but is unable to. He sees a pistol that had been taken apart before. Jodrell Bank calls back in, but this time a woman responds, calling for help. McCray communicates with her and tracks her using her descriptions.

For this purpose I must\nutilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose\ninadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.\nEach time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary\nreports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury\nof facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free\nof the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in\nyour task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we\nreturn again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of\nBombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.\nTomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact\nlocation, for the not-people might have access to the information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it\nis alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from\nthe pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational\nlikeness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among\nthem. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway\nlies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in\norder that I might destroy the not-people completely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too\nfast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision.\nGezsltrysk, what a task!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farewell till later.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Wichita, Kansas\n  <br/>\n  June 13\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you,\nI see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are\nno terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in\nnot-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my\nbirth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited\nequipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor\ncame in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation\nreigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What\ndifference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me.\nAs they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally,\nsince I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother\n(Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up\ntheir hands and left.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I learned the following day that the opposite component of my\nnot-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance\nduring my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a\nbender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I\nmade a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36\nnot-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was\nstanding by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind.\nHe stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of\nspeech.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I\nproduced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Poppa,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that\nare now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded\nlow-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have\njarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the\nroom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something\nabout my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at\nthe doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth,\nshe fell down heavily. She made a distinct\n  <i>\n   thump\n  </i>\n  on the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window\nand retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched,\nbut I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the\ncleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply\nfrom Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise\nindeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats.\nBut you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself\nand it's his nature never to flatter anyone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the\nqualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this\nalleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive\nmythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people\nrefer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we\nlearned otherwise, while they never have.\n </p>\n <p>\n  New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard\ntime classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to the\ninevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of\nthe not-world and return to our world a hero. I cannot understand your\nnot replying to my letters. I have given you a box number. What could\nhave happened to your vibrations?\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Albuquerque, New Mexico\n  <br/>\n  June 15\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had tremendous difficulty getting a letter off to you this time.\nMy process—original with myself, by the way—is to send out feeler\nvibrations for what these people call the psychic individual. Then I\nestablish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his\nknowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my\nletter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he\nhas done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an\nindividual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but\nI fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell\nyou about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have\naccomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of\nsleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz &amp; uhrytzg ... no, it won't come out.\nAnyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ...\nmy brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard\ntime classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire\nthe stuff needed for the destruction of these people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sunrise came as I expected. According to my catalog of information, the\nimpressions aroused by it are of beauty. It took little conditioning\nfor me finally to react in this manner. This is truly an efficient\nmechanism I inhabit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions.\nIt was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried\nimmediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up\nand all about me at the beauty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Soon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I\nsimply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was\nto realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not\nlet yourself believe they do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here.\nHer hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She\nwore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was\ndiverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from\nnearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with\nan attitude of mild interest. They weren't interested in me, I told\nmyself. But they were.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you\nunfortunately do not have—invisibility. I lay there and listened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He was stark naked,\" the girl with the sneakers said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lizzy, you'll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of\nthis area.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy,\" the officer ordered. \"No more speeches\nin the Square. Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now\nwhere is your naked friend? I'm going to make an example of him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was it—I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this\noversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions\nthat assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty,\npain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don't know one from the other. I\nmust feel each, become accustomed to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I\nhave been given is very unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe.\nWhat will Blgftury and the others say of this? My great mission is\nimpaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write\nyou with more enlightenment.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Moscow, Idaho\n  <br/>\n  June 17\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greet\nme in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope,\npride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of five\nbucks!\n </p>\n <p>\n  It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with\nthe correct variant of the slang term \"buck.\" Is it possible that you\nare powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in\nthis inferior world?\n </p>\n <p>\n  A reminder, please. You and I—I in particular—are now engaged in\na struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions\nof this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have lived\na semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world\nripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individual\nfluctuations make up our sentient population.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardized\nby these people. The not-world and our world are like two baskets\nas you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the\ngreatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides\nare joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational\nplane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world\nof higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples.\nWhile we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer,\nmore stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves\ninto ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force\nsome of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily,\ncausing them much agony and fright.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call\nmediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one\nof them at the first opportunity to see for myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I picked\nthem up while examining the \"slang\" portion of my information catalog\nwhich you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimate\ncause—in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peace\nof our world—shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short,\nget hep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Des Moines, Iowa\n  <br/>\n  June 19\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages\nin my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need.\nBiological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here\n\"revolting\" are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they are\nall being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the most\nimportant part of my journey—completion of the weapon against the\nnot-worlders—I would come to New York immediately. You would rue that\nday, I assure you.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Boise, Idaho\n  <br/>\n  July 15\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  A great deal has happened to me since I wrote to you last.\nSystematically, I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in\nour catalog. I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed\nbending before the winds of passion. In fact, I'm rather badly bent\nindeed. Ah! You'll pardon me, but I just took time for what is known\nquaintly in this tongue as a \"hooker of red-eye.\" Ha! I've mastered\neven the vagaries of slang in the not-language.... Ahhh! Pardon me\nagain. I feel much better now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions that\nconstantly assaulted my mind through this body, I conditioned myself to\nreact exactly as our information catalog instructed me to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I am\nburned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle,\nI experience a tickle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group\nof symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon me\nagain. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely\nenough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world\ncame most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thing\nhere, both among those who haven't got it and those who have.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank and\ncarried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the money\nto a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best\nhotel here in—no, sorry—and stared at it for hours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing happened. I didn't love the stuff or feel one way or the other\nabout it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for\nthe love of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten or\nfifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare\nrooms filled with money. If I don't love it then, I'll feel I have\nfailed. This alcohol is taking effect now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Blgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports!\nI've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I've been\nstudying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics of\nthese people, in the movies. This is the best place to see these\npeople as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and there\ndo homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Love. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it won't\ncost me anything. It'll come out of the pocket of the idiot who's\nwriting this letter. Pretty shrewd of me, eh?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm going out and look at that money again. I think I'm at last\nlearning to love it, though not as much as I admire liquor. Well, one\nsimply must persevere, I always say.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Penobscot, Maine\n  <br/>\n  July 20\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned it\nin any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across\nto this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a\nquart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel\nwonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this\nbody and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now\nI can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today\noutlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must\nfinally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experiments\nyet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of\nthe inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss his\nvibrations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a\nblonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was\nattracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is\nperfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember\ndistinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I\nhad dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.\nWe went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you\nbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the\nmoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve\nends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these\nimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the\nadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the\nentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the\ntingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself\nquickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now in all the motion pictures—true representations of life and love\nin this world—the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl\nand tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.\nThis pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,\nwanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would\nhave a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.\nWell, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I\nhad not found love.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell\nasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin\nand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don't\nI wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?\nI'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is a\ngin mixture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'll\ntake him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting up\nan atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do\nis activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe,\nyou old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off the\nfat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Glmpauszn\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p class=\"ph4\">\n  Sacramento, Calif.\n  <br/>\n  July 25\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dear Joe:\n </p>\n <p>\n  All is lost unless we work swiftly. I received your revealing letter\nthe morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a\nlot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance\nthings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got\nto the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and\ncontinued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again\nbecause she said yes immediately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the\nmost frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these\npeople really are to our world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong\npsychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I\nwas too busy with the redhead to notice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal\ngrandmother, Lucy, from the beyond. The medium went into his act. He\nconcentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in\nthe room. The best way to describe it in not-world language is a white,\nshapeless cascade of light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mrs. Somebody reared to her feet and screeched, \"Grandma Lucy!\" Then I\nreally took notice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Grandma Lucy, nothing! This medium had actually brought Blgftury\npartially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in\nthe fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku\nwas open and his btgrimms were down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Worst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable\npattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the\nredhead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a\nresult of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these\nnot-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality\nof not-reality. It's true. I cannot do without it now. The day is only\nhalf over and I have consumed a quart and a half. And it is dulling all\nmy powers as it has practically obliterated yours.

I must pick\ncloser points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but\nfailure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula\nthat is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were\nfilled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I\nrealized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction\nthat inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there\nimmediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not\naware of the nature of my activities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I\nstuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered\ninto the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager\nI was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best\ncustomer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was baffled. What could I tell him?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're—they're—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're what?\" he wanted to know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're not safe.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.\nAnother day, another hotel.

Ivan recounts an occurrence in the Plaza Ritz Arms where two alcoholic guests that he calls “stew bums”, Joe Binkle and Ed Smith (an alias for Glmpauszn), mysteriously disappeared, leaving their suits behind as if they had melted out of them. Ed had checked in with a mirror with a heavy bronze frame. After their disappearance, Ivan found only their clothes, the frame of the mirror in Ed’s room, and a stack of letters in the bureau in Joe’s room, which are the letters that tell the remaining story.\nThe vibrational plane of an alien world extends into Earth’s (which they call the not-world), allowing intrusive vibrations from Earth to semi-terrorize sentient alien vibrations. Human spiritual mediums can force psychic reproductions of themselves into the alien world, and conversely pull alien vibrations over the “fringe”. The aliens can’t tolerate it, and send Glmpauszn and Joe to take on human form and develop a chemical weapon to kill all humans.\nGlmpauszn crosses the fringe through a vibrational gateway that allows his consciousness to move into a newborn baby. Joe has already arrived in human form. Glmpauszn quickly grows the baby into an adult man. At three days old, he is 36 inches tall and talking, and a couple of days later is an adult man. Glmpauszn writes to Joe by controlling the minds of sleeping people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. He wonders why Joe won’t write to him, and can’t contact him spiritually, like normal, since Joe has fallen into alcoholism. Glmpauszn forgets to wear clothes and is nearly arrested, but escapes by becoming invisible. When Joe finally writes, it is to ask for money, enraging Glmpauszn who reports Joe’s actions to their boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn becomes distracted by exploring human emotions like intimacy with women and love of money, which causes him to rob a bank and fill 18 rooms of a hotel with money. He also falls into alcoholism. Blgftury is accidentally summoned into a seance by a human medium who pulls Blgftury’s vibrations through the fringe (the very thing they are trying to stop from happening), and Glmpauszn is caught with a red-haired woman by his boss not doing his job. Glmpauszn finally develops a mold that can kill humans, and meets with Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms with lots of gin that they consume before successfully returning to the vibrational frequency of their world, releasing the mold in the room.\n"}, {"worker_id": "2", "uid": "0ee7e5e19f5444b29790387160211461", "response_text": "\n\tThe story begins with a letter to the editor of a magazine describing two unusual incidents in a hotel in New York.

The man who owns the hotel doesn’t want to involve the police for fear of reprisals against him; therefore, he sends the letters to the magazine, hoping they will print them. \n\tThe rest of the story is a series of letters, all addressed to Joe Binkle but written in different handwritings and from other parts of the US and the world. They trace the progress of a being named Glmpauszn who, in the first letter, is preparing to be born so that he can enter human society. Once he is born, he grows quickly, and within days, he escapes the hospital and hides in a cave until he has grown into a man. At that point, he makes his way to a chemist to procure the chemicals he needs for his mission: to destroy humanity for encroaching on his world. He walks down the street trying to act normal, but a young lady sees him and begins screaming: he has forgotten to wear clothes. Glmpauszn blames part of his failure on Joe, who apparently is supposed to provide him with the background information he needs to succeed.\n\tGlmpauszn often comments that he has yet to receive a return letter from Joe, but when he does, he complains that Joe has asked him for a $5.00 loan. Glmpauszn refuses the loan initially, making much of the fact that Joe didn’t greet him or express pleasure at his arrival. Glmpauszn alludes to the fact that humans have encroached on their world through the use of mediums or spiritualists. \n\tGlmpauszn takes time to experience various aspects of humanity, including emotions and impressions, such as love of money, love, beauty, pain, etc. He thinks he is on the verge of love until he suggests a biological exploration of it and the women say yes, leading him to conclude it isn’t love. In the meantime, Glmpauszn drinks more and more and accidentally sets off an explosion in his hotel rooms. \n\tGlmpauszn keeps Joe up to date on what he is doing but complains about Blgrtury’s criticism and demands for reports. Finally, Glmpauszn tells Joe that he has successfully created a mold that will destroy humans by dissolving their brains and then their bodies. He also tells Joe to meet him at his original place of birth, and he will bring the gateway, a large mirror. The plan is to drink all the gin they have and then plant the mold in the hotel.\n\tThe hotel owner has read all the letters and wants to know if anyone can tell him how long a gleeb is, as several times in his letters, Glmpauszn refers to this length of time.\n"}, {"worker_id": "12", "uid": "461d6a004d694cb09b5b06532aba5a67", "response_text": "The story begins with a hotel owner, Ivan Smernda, writing to the editor of a magazine about two strange guests at his hotel.

The letter's author, Ivan Smernda, owns a hotel called Plaza Ritz Arms, and recently two of his guests mysteriously vanished leaving behind several letters, a mirror frame without the mirror, and each of their suit of clothes, perfectly intact. The men are named Ed Smith and Joe Binkle, although Ivan guesses these are aliases. Ivan shares the men's letters with the editor in the hopes that they will be printed and serve as a warning for humanity. The first letter reveals Ed Smith's true name, which is Glmpauszn. Glmpauszn and Joe are Frequencies, ghost-like entities that exist in a spirit dimension adjacent to human reality. Due to the rise of humans using the services of mediums and fortune tellers to make contact with loved ones in the spirit world, the Frequencies feel terrorized. Glmpauszn has been sent to inhabit the human dimension, what he calls the \"not-world\", in order to find a way to destroy humanity and end its assault upon the vibrations of the Frequencies. Joe has already spent several \"gleebs\" (an unspecified amount of time) on Earth studying human ways in order to prepare Glmpauszn for his mission. They write to each other by possessing the minds and bodies of sleeping humans who can translate the language and write the letters. Glmpauszn details how he attuned himself to a human fetus and then sped up the growing process upon his birth, believing that the speed of his growth would impress his not-mother and not-father. Instead, he only frightens them both, and he runs away to a cave whereupon he accelerates his growth until he becomes an adult. As he begins to seek out a chemist to help him begin to plan the destruction of humanity, he runs into a woman who screams when she sees he is totally naked. Embarrassed, Glmpauszn lashes out at Joe, complaining that he has not prepared him sufficiently for his mission, and he must better learn human customs and emotions. He slowly adapts the forms and impressions of the human dimension. Not only does he love drinking hard liquor, but he also uses his invisibility power to rob a bank and fill his eighteen-room suite at the hotel with money. As Glmpauszn grows increasingly enamored with the human experience, he begins to neglect his mission, including reporting to his boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn drinks excessively and starts to court women, seeking out the elusive feeling of love. One night he even attends a seance, and the medium summons Blgftury, who glares at him in anger. As Glmpauszn falls deeper into alcoholism, his neglect of the mission becomes so bad that he accidentally blows up his suite of rooms at the hotel. Eventually, he devises a kind of mold that can cause a fatal disease to spread throughout the planet.

I should have told Arthur.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk\nabout?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,\n“there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling.\nAnd now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re\nstored in one end of the attic.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed\nLois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n  <i>\n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n  </i>\n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told\nher. “I bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they’re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she’s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t\nglad to have her.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You here again?” she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “In the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n  <i>\n   Ghost\nParade\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling\nher, “and you solved everything.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “A fountain with tears for water. How strange!”\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “That tease!”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so\nare you!”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Peter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly\nexclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n“Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Were they?” asked Lois.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.\n“There weren’t any of them impossible.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.\n“Is this beautiful fountain real?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a\ntear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,” the voice had repeated.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “But what is there to cry about?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Then you—you\n  <i>\n   are\n  </i>\n  the fountain!” Judy remembered\nexclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It\ndoesn’t have a voice.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"pb c004\"/>\n <h2 class=\"c013\" id=\"chap02\">\n  CHAPTER II\n </h2>\n If Wishes Came True\n <p class=\"c014\">\n  “Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n“Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming\nto that.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “But what were they?” Lois insisted.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything\nmore.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois\nasked.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “And your wishes all came true!”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then\nit was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was\nenchanted?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, “I was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it\nwasn’t a flying carpet?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured\nher, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “All the year around?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n“Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long\nway from June to December.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy\nsaid, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream\nyou’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t\nyou try to solve the mystery?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.\n“It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,”\nLois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve\nseen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll\nshow you.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks\nhe’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “He can read my mind. He always knows where\nI’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,” Judy urged her friends.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,”\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n“Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “When I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn’t it?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That’s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It\nis. It’s the very same one.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!”\nJudy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m\nsure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love\nto, wouldn’t you, Judy?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.\n“Do you recognize it, too?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. “It looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned.\n“Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. “I do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,” she told them.\n“I never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?”\nLois suggested.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"pb c004\"/>\n <h2 class=\"c013\" id=\"chap03\">\n  CHAPTER III\n </h2>\n A Strange Encounter\n <p class=\"c014\">\n  Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\ntrip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\nit under one condition. They were not to drive all\nthe way to the house which, she said, was just over\nthe hilltop. They were to park the car where no\none would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “You’ll remember it, won’t you?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Judy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure.\nShe and Lois both argued that it would be better to\ninquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “She’d be glad to show us around. This way it\nlooks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they\nstarted off in the blue car she was driving.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\neasy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\nand said if they did find the fountain she thought\nshe’d wish for one exactly like it.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Well, you know what your grandmother said\nabout wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you\nlet people know about them instead of muttering\nthem to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know\nabout this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\nbe Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\ncoat he gave me last year.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too\nwarm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\ntrip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\nas it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\nhad covered the distance that had seemed such a\nlong way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s\nwagon.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve\njust about figured out how it happened. I didn’t\nthink my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\nto pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\nqueer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s\nold farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\n  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t\nexplain what happened afterwards. When I woke\nup in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\nwagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “How could they?” asked Lois.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to\nsee how beautiful everything was before—”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Again she broke off as if there were something\nshe wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Before what?” questioned Judy.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\nwere telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\nbut you never did explain how you got back home,”\nLorraine reminded her.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it,\nbut it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember\ndriving home along this road. You see, I thought my\ngrandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\nand would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\nThere wasn’t a house in sight.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “The Brandt house is just over the top of this next\nhill,” Lois put in.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I know. You told me that. Now I know why I\ncouldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\ntower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\nI followed it. There’s something about a path in\nthe woods that always tempts me.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\nyour latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where\nthe hammock was and then through an archway,”\nJudy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes\npeered out at me from unexpected places. I was\nactually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\nThere wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard\nthe rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he\nwas driving off without me.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise,\nand Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like\nthat?”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\nand wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.\n“The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\nthem, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for\nMrs. Brandt they may still be there.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they\nturned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  “Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s\nanother car coming.”\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\nducked her head.

You’re not interested in Roger\nBanning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better\nthan that. I did know him slightly, but not from\nschool. The boys and girls were separated and went\nto different high schools by the time we moved to\n  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\nlot better.

He stole some checkbooks from\nhis father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\nbusiness people. I think he forged some legal\ndocuments, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\nIt was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.\n </p>\n <p class=\"c015\">\n  Now Judy did remember. It was something she\nwould have preferred to forget.

She discovered a photo of a spectacular fountain in her grandmother’s hot attic one summer as she was stuck there for two weeks while her parents went on vacation. She shed a tear onto the photo while recalling her sadness about not having friends or a sister, and imagined the fountain was a place for lonely girls to fill with their tears. Her grandmother overhears her speaking aloud her wishes and calls that she shouldn’t keep her wishes to herself, because “most of them aren’t so impossible.”\nJudy’s grandparents take her to the fountain in the photo and it speaks to Judy, directing her to shed a tear into it and make wishes. Judy sheds a tear thinking about how her only friend just moved out of town and then hurries through her wishes before the ripples disappear - to have lots of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. All things that have come true in her life.\nAbruptly returning to Judy’s modern timeline, she takes Lois and Lorraine to the attic. They are spooked by Judy’s black cat, Blackberry, who makes sudden noises. Judy finds the photo and Lorraine recognizes the fountain is identical to one on her estate - yet it is in a different location. They surmise that it is in the woods on the edge of town that are part of the Brandt estate, and drive to it immediately.\nDuring their adventure, Judy recalls more of her fountain memory. Her grandparents didn’t know the Brandt’s well enough to pay them a visit, but instead stopped by the fountain on their way to drop off her grandmother’s hooked rugs at the estate further up the path. Judy was left behind napping in a hammock - told by her grandparents they were getting her a surprise, but they didn’t return. She followed a path to an old windowless tower, but got distracted by the sound of her grandfather's cart leaving. This is all she recalls, but there is evidently more to discover that will solve the mystery.\nThe trip to the fountain shakes the confidence of Lorraine in the back seat, who knows information about the new owners of the estate - Roger Banning - that she is withholding. Lois and Judy probe her about what she knows and why she ducked down to hide her face from a stranger passing in a car.

When Judy was growing up, her parents would spend summers on vacation without her, so she did a lot of reading at her Grandmother Smeed's house. These were sad summers for her, but she would soon start to solve mysteries and find her own adventures. She mentioned her tears falling on a magazine with a picture of a fountain; she imagined it was full of tears of many girls and pondered the idea of an enchanted fountain. Her grandparents took her to see a fountain the next day, where she heard a voice that told her to make a wish and to cry into the fountain--the same fountain that was in the picture in the magazine. Judy's friends got more excited about the story, and it continued: she had to think of a wise wish, but reacted too quickly to think carefully. Her wishes did come true; she wanted lots of friends, a sister, to solve mysteries, and to marry a G-man. All of these things came true, and the fountain kept Judy captivated. She patiently explained to her friends that she hadn't tried to learn the secret of the fountain, and it didn't speak to her after the initial encounter. Judy had lost her appetite for her dessert but wanted to retrieve the photo of the fountain to see if Lois recognized it; they all went to the attic, bringing Blackberry the cat with them. Lorraine recognized the photo of the fountain, but it seemed to make her nervous. Lois didn't want to leave yet even though Lorraine was clearly uncomfortable and wanted to go, and thought she might recognize the fountain from the Brandt estate, so Lois and Judy decide it's worth checking out to see if it's the same one. Lorraine only agreed to join after they promised not to drive all the way up to the house, and to walk the last part of the way. After a twenty-minute drive, Judy talked more about what she remembered about the day she visited the garden; she'd fallen asleep in a hammock, and woke up to an empty garden. She headed towards a tower but found her grandfather's car before she encountered anyone. Through all of this, Lorraine hints that she knows more than she's letting on, and doesn't think things will be as Judy expected. This is when Judy picks up on Lorraine's reticence. Judy and Lois want to explore the old tower and look for the fountain, when Lois admits she knows Roger Banning has been around the area.

Judy enters at the end of the conversation, admitting that she has problems, too, and hasn’t been able to solve all the mysteries she has attempted. When Judy mentions a promise she made not to discuss the dam and that she should have told Arthur, Lorraine has a pained expression and asks them not to talk about him.\nLois changes the subject, praising Judy’s mystery-solving and ghost tracking abilities that she then explains sensibly; she asks Judy to tell them a story about one of her mysteries. Judy tells them about the haunted fountain that she saw when she was fifteen years old and spending part of the summer with her grandparents while her parents were on vacation. In the attic to look at some of her grandmother’s old magazines, Judy began feeling sorry for being left behind and started crying. Her tear fell onto a picture of a fountain, and she pretended it was filled with the tears of lonely girls.

All day, Lois engages in eager conversation, asking Judy questions as she tells her story, while Lorraine appears lost, glum, and hurt; Lorraine starts comments that she doesn’t finish and mysteriously seems to know more about the Brandt estate than she will tell the other two women."}, {"worker_id": "12", "uid": "e8bfddf806624827bde18193cf92e805", "response_text": "Lois and Lorraine appear to be sisters.

Judy is describing more of a symbolic relationship with a woman of her age, but Lois does not clarify if her relationship with Lorraine is by blood or simply by love like how Judy is describing.

I let myself into the apartment, which\nhad an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown\ntemperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but\naccording to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got\ndressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my\nwife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I've vacuumed\nthe carpet, I've dusted and I've straightened the cushions.... Ah! The\nashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still the\nplace looked wife-deserted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I'd\nhad to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios I\nwrite for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella\nwhen I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost\ntropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a\nwoman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Madison and Fifty-fourth,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Right,\" said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go\non grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. \"Sorry, Mac.\nYou'll have to find another cab. Good hunting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over\nmy hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held\nme up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,\njust in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one\nwhich exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing\nhappened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain\nhad stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  As I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where\nthey were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the\nusual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular,\na man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay.\nWhile I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was\nable to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size\nof an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight,\nand then his chattering drill hit it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on\nhis back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the\nmoment of the explosion—if so feeble a thing can be called one—I\nfelt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my\nhand. I mopped at it with my handkerchief but, though slight, the\nbleeding would not stop, so I went into a drugstore and bought some\npink adhesive which I put on the tiny cut. When I got to the studio, I\nfound that I had missed the story conference.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During the day, by actual count, I heard the phrase \"I'm just\nspitballing\" eight times, and another Madison Avenue favorite,\n\"The whole ball of wax,\" twelve times. However, my story had been\naccepted without change because nobody had noticed my absence from the\nconference room. There you have what is known as the Advertising World,\nthe Advertising game or the advertising racket, depending upon which\nrung of the ladder you have achieved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The subway gave a repeat performance going home, and as I got to the\napartment house we live in, the cop on the afternoon beat was standing\nthere talking to the doorman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"Hello, Mr. Graham. I guess you must have just have missed it\nat your office building.\" I looked blank and he explained, \"We just\nheard it a little while ago: all six elevators in your building jammed\nat the same time. Sounds crazy. I guess you just missed it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anything can happen in advertising, I thought. \"That's right, Danny, I\njust missed it,\" I said, and went on in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Psychiatry tells us that some people are accident-prone; I, on the\nother hand, seemed recently to be coincidence-prone, fluke-happy, and\nexcept for the alarm clock, I'd had no control over what had been going\non.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went into our little kitchen to make a drink and reread the\ndirections Molly had left, telling me how to get along by myself until\nshe got back from her mother's in Oyster Bay, a matter of ten days.\nHow to make coffee, how to open a can, whom to call if I took sick and\nsuch. My wife used to be a trained nurse and she is quite convinced\nthat I cannot take a breath without her. She is right, but not for the\nreasons she supposes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: \"When\nyou take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door,\ntoo.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in\nfront of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate\nme from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil.\nWhen I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the\nmanuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The\npencil was standing on its end.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  There, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hear\nabout, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and drank\nsome of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the\nmuggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter\nto try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last\nsentence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising.\nMy drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's\nnotes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed\none that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: \"Garbage\npicked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I\nlove you.\" What can you do when the girl loves you?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window\nat the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was\nexercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be\nallowed to perch, but were not allowed to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that\ntheir wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking\nabout this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn,\nthey seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all\nwanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and\nfell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and\npicked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side,\nstroking its feathers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were\ninterrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is\nusually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like\nan incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that\nof my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has\nnever, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late\nafternoon.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't say a thing like that to me!\" I heard him shout. \"I tell you\nI got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we started\nto play!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Several other loud voices started at the same time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah, and only when you were dealer!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened the\ndoor to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confronting\nhim, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and the\nimpulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and he\nlooked stunned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here!\" he said, holding out a deck of cards, \"For Pete's sake, look at\n'em yourselves if you think they're marked!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nearest man struck them up from his hand. \"Okay, Houdini! So\nthey're not marked! All I know is five straight....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards\non the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the\nrest face up—all red.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Someone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and\nthe four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence,\ngot in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly\narranged cards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Judas!\" he said, and started to pick them up. \"Will you look at that!\nMy God, what a session....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it,\nbut I had an idea what I would hear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never seen anything to equal it,\" he said. \"Wouldn't have believed\nit. Those guys\n  <i>\n   didn't\n  </i>\n  believe it. Every round normal, nothing\nunusual about the hands—three of a kind, a low straight, that sort\nof thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be\n  <i>\n   my\n  </i>\n  deal. Brother! Straight flush to the king—every time! And each time,\nsomebody else has four aces....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There\nwas one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top\nbroke and glass chips got into the bottle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll have to go down for more soda,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll come, too. I need air.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in\nwhat must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the\ntop of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the\ntile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from\nat least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and\nI was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth\nopen and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his\nmouth open.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  On the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie\nhis shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi\nswerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded,\nits rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign\ncars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any\nside-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to\nrest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that\nmoment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and\nthe taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged\ncrosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either\nforward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi\nto a lamp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at\nall, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues.\nEveryone was honking his horn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Danny was furious—more so when he tried to put through a call to his\nstation house from the box opposite.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was out of order.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the\nwindows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had\nbrightened up considerably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,\" he said.\n\"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned\nand nodded toward the pandemonium.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk\nlamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except\none. That was tied in three knots.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All\n  <i>\n   right\n  </i>\n  , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had\ncome for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call\nMcGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university\nuptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he\nknows everything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,\n  <i>\n   more\n  </i>\n  trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's\nvoice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were\nconnected. That's a damn funny coincidence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I've got something for\nyou to work on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At once,\" he said, and hung up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of\nmy novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a\npoint where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it\nwas too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter\n\"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to\nthe side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was absolutely not my day.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" McGill said, \"nothing you've told me is impossible or\nsupernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against\nthat poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him.\nIt's all those other things....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight\nwhile I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at\nwhat I'm going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely,\nand the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that\nyou're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion.\" I started\nto get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. \"I know, but don't\nyou see that that is far more likely than....\" He stopped and shook\nhis head. Then he brightened. \"I have an idea. Maybe we can have a\ndemonstration.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. \"Have you any\nchange on you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why, yes,\" I said. \"Quite a bit.\" I reached into my pocket. There\nmust have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. \"Do you think\nthey'll each have the same date, perhaps?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you accumulate all that change today?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. During the week.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shook his head. \"In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you\ncould have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that\nwould be\n  <i>\n   actually\n  </i>\n  impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll\ntell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if\nthey all come up heads.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the\nfloor. They clattered and bounced—and bounced together—and stacked\nthemselves into a neat pile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a\nhandful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,\nthe adjacent ones touching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that\nthere are two great apparently opposite principles governing the\nUniverse—random and design. The sands on the beach are an example\nof random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions\nof the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so\nmany of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of\nThermodynamics—quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;\nit's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other\nhand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes\nagainst it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental\nmanifestation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is\ncontrolling the coins and—the other things?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He shook his head. \"No. All I mean is that improbable things usually\nhave improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken,\nI don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the\nbook of rules. Something—I don't know what—is going on, and it seems\nto involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you\nstill in that building when the elevators stuck? Or near it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I guess I must have been. It happened just after I left.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hm. You're the center, all right. But why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Center of what?\" I asked. \"I feel as though I were the center of an\nelectrical storm. Something has it in for me!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  McGill grinned. \"Don't be superstitious. And especially don't be\nanthropomorphic.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, if it's the opposite of random, it's got to be a form of life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"On what basis? All we know for certain is that random motions are\nbeing rearranged. A crystal, for example, is not life, but it's a\nnon-random arrangement of particles.... I wonder.\" He had a faraway,\nfrowning look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was beginning to feel hungry and the drinks had worn off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's go out and eat,\" I said, \"There's not a damn thing in the\nkitchen and I'm not allowed to cook. Only eggs and coffee.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we\ncould hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were,\nby this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we\nheard one of them say to Danny, \"I don't know what the hell's going\non around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it.\nThey can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen\nanything like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they\ntried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let\nthe other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had\nembarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were\nreplaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, smart guy!\" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead,\nonly to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches\nwhich met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts\never witnessed—a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything\nelse, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical\nexcuses and threats.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. \"You all right,\nMr. Graham?\" he asked. \"I don't know what's going on around here, but\never since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!\"\nhe shouted—he could succeed as a hog-caller. \"Bring those dames over\nhere!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas\nintertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over\nfenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the\nladies seemed not to be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my\numbrella and we'll say no more about it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also\ncaught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the\nother two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,\nbut the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was\nMolly. My nurse-wife.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all\nright?\" Was\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  all right!\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Molly! What are you doing here?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to\nthink.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course I'm all right. But why....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's\nnumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced\nand it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got a\nbusy signal. Oh, dear, are you\n  <i>\n   sure\n  </i>\n  you're all right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look.\nThen I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast\nto it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said.\n\"And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was\na jump ahead of him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In other words, you think it's something organic?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" McGill said, \"I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.\nI'm not doing so well,\" he confessed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But so far as I can see,\" Molly answered, \"it's mere probability, and\nwithout any over-all pattern.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. \"Do you\n  <i>\n   feel\n  </i>\n  all right, darling?\" she asked me. I nodded brightly. \"You'll\nthink this silly of me,\" she went on to McGill, \"but why isn't it\nsomething like an overactive poltergeist?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pure concept,\" he said. \"No genuine evidence.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Magnetism?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't\nmagnetic—and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,\nand a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has\nmainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,\nall you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of\niron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay\nthere, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than\nthat—they go on moving.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Only an analogy,\" said McGill. \"A crystal resembles life in that it\nhas a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree\nthis—thing—has no discernible shape and motion\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  involved, but\nplants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but\nit does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a\nnon-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and\nit has a nucleus and it seems to be growing—at least in what you might\ncall improbability.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Molly frowned. \"Then what\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  it? What's it made of?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about\nthe atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to\nbe forming around a nucleus not of its own material—the way a speck\nof sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of\ncrystallization.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,\" Molly said, and gave me an\nimpertinent look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why,\" I asked McGill, \"did you say the coins couldn't have the same\ndate? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because I don't think this thing got going before today and\neverything that's happened can all be described as improbable motions\nhere and now.

Finally\nthe man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried\nto explain to me what had happened with the phone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the\nreceiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long\ntime! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her\nnearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the\nfloor—something like that—just happened to cause the right induction\nimpulses. Yes, I know how you feel,\" he said, seeing my expression.\n\"It's beginning to bear down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was\nso pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm in no mood to cook,\" she said. \"Let's get away from all this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  McGill raised an eyebrow. \"If all this, as you call it, will let us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've been put on the story—who could be better?—I live here. So far,\nI don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny,\nbut he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in\nsome mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's got a theory,\" said Molly. \"Come and eat with us and he'll tell\nyou all about it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth\nAvenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than\nbefore and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,\nand when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the\nlieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham,\" Danny said, \"it's at the\nstation house. What there's left of it, that is.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt\nthe speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of\ncigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I\nhappened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before\nI could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the\nsidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but\nsaid nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool—although it\ndidn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door\nand ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the\nnext table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green\nevening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter\nreturned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold\ncuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfait\nfor the fat lady.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used\ninstead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and\nmade faces.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The waiter was concerned and apologetic, and took the drinks back to\nthe bar across the room. The bartender looked over at us and tasted\none of the drinks. Then he dumped them in his sink with a puzzled\nexpression and made a new batch. After shaking this up, he set out a\nrow of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing\ncame out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again.\nStill nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his\npick, his face pink with exasperation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  a\ncrystal, I thought to myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing\nhappened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar\ncrowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back,\nbaffled, saying he'd have the drinks in a moment, and went to the\nkitchen. When he returned, he had madame's vichyssoise and some rolls,\nwhich he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had\ngrown larger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Molly lit a cigarette and said, \"I suppose this is all part of it,\nAlec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter—a background noise\nhad stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of\nthe air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made\na gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly's when she tapped her\ncigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring\nvichyssoise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey! What's the idea?\" snarled the sour-looking man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident. I—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Throwing cigarettes at people!\" the fat lady said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I really didn't mean to,\" I began again, getting up. There must have\nbeen a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff\nbuttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely\nset tables, I pulled everything—tablecloth, silver, water glasses,\nashtrays and the vichyssoise-à-la-nicotine—onto the floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man\nlicked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The\nowner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us\nwith a determined manner. I tried to explain what had happened, but I\nwas outshouted, and the owner frowned darkly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "26b7ab68cba049ae80cd2efc54532e51", "response_text": "Alec Graham returns to his home from the office after a long day.

The taxi driver refuses to take him to Madison and Fifty-fourth, and the rain has gotten worse. His hand continuously bleeds after passing by a big excavation site, and he misses his story conference. After hearing the same phrases numerous times and all six elevators being jammed, he is convinced that he is coincidence prone. Molly leaves him instructions on how to take care of himself, and he works on his novel. More of these events happen with pigeons colliding and somebody getting five straight-flushes in a row. Nat tells Alec about the strange occurrence as they get soda. The three bottles do not break after falling at least five feet, and Danny, the cop, is shocked. Outside, more strange events occur when Nat almost gets caught up with a swerving taxi. Once they return home, he immediately calls McGill, an assistant mathematics professor for some expert advice. Once McGill arrives, he says that all of the events are very improbable, which makes him inclined to believe that Alec is stringing him on or subject to delusion. They do an experiment involving coin-throwing, and all of the coins are arranged in a neat pile when Alec throws them. McGill asks him some more questions about any recent occurrences, but Alec suggests that they go outside to eat. Outside, the cars are being towed away, while two pedestrians are having trouble letting each other pass. Danny is confused by all that is happening. Alec also runs into Molly, stuck in a confused wrangle of umbrellas with two other women. She explains that somebody from their home had kept calling her mother’s number, so she came back to investigate. Back at the apartment, all of this is traced back to Alec as the center. McGill tries to explain what is possibly happening to Alec, but they are interrupted by the telephone repairman. Molly suggests they go out to a restaurant to eat, and Nat comes along. They pass by the car jam again, and the police lieutenant looks at Alec with interest. Even at the restaurant, Alec realizes that his Tom Collins drink is made with salt instead of sugar.

He recalls the events from earlier that day; he had forgotten to set his alarm clock, making him late for a conference at the advertising studio he works at. He had forgotten an umbrella and found himself in the pouring rain, where he caught a taxi only for it to not start. The subways had suffered delays as well. On his walk to the office, Alec passed by a construction site, where he was nicked by a piece of glass from an explosion. He ended up missing his conference, and on his way home, a cop tells him that the elevators in his office building had all broken down as soon as he left. Alec reflects on these events, perplexed by the accident-prone coincidences. He decides to write at his typewriter when he drops his pencil, finding that it has landed standing on its end. As he continues to be stunned by the events, he fixes a drink for himself, taking note of the several notes that his wife, Molly, had left him while she visits her mother. Alec then witnesses a card game between his neighbor, Nat, and a group of men, in which Nat draws five straight flushes. Alec invites Nat in after the heated game, and after breaking a soda, they go to the corner store to buy more, where the bottles fall through the bottom of the bag. As the two walk back to their apartment, Nat is nearly bumped into and he steps onto the curb, causing a severe accident between multiple cars. Nat later leaves to his office to write an article about the strange events, and Alec calls up McGill, a mathematics professor and friend. McGill comes to Alec's apartment, and he is suspicious that he may be delusional or lying, due to the impossible probability of the events occurring. McGill then tosses some change onto the floor, testing to see if they all land on heads; instead, the coins stack up on top of each other. McGill is also confused, trying to imagine an explanation, and Alec suggests that some form of life is controlling the events. The two go out for food and pass by three women who have their umbrellas tangled up together. One of the women turns out to be Molly, who says she returned after her mother had been receiving constant calls from Alec's phone with no one on the other end. They go back to the apartment and discuss the matter, as the telephone repairman arrives. After, the three go to a restaurant, and face more inconveniences, such as having salt in their drink instead of sugar.

He finds his neighbor Nat in an argument with a group of men accusing Nat of cheating. In a fit of rage, one of the men hits the deck of cards that Nat is holding, causing them to be tossed to the floor.

At the deli, another strange incident occurs. The 3 glasses of club soda fall through a thin plastic bag, 5 feet towards the ground and do not break when they should have broken due to the fall. The storekeeper is shocked but Alec shrugs off the weird incident. Nat and Alec return to his apartment where he notices more strange coincidences. Alec grows frustrated and decides to call his friend McGill to help him make sense of everything. McGill promptly comes over to Alec’s apartment to help.

Back home Alec saw his wife's nots with directions all around as she left to attend to her mother. Then he tried to write his novel and came to a dead end, so he poured himself a drink and watched some pigeons being trained outside, when some traffic occurred and a couple birds fell. There were loud voices outside: four men confronted the narrator's neighbor, a shy guy named Nat. Then the man came in for a drink, and told Alec that he had miraculously won in cards a couple times in a row, and his partners believed he had cheated. The narrator and Nat went out for sodas in glass bottles, which fell and miraculously did not break. On the street, a pedestrian, who suddenly stopped in front of Nat, caused a series of accidents leading to a huge traffic jam. Back at Alec's place, the curtain was weirdly tied in three knots and he called his knowledgeable friend McGill to get a consultation. The man came and considered all of the day's weird events very improbable but not impossible. McGill offered to make a demonstration, so Alec threw a handful of coins which bounced together, stacking into a neat pile. McGill's coins created an exactly straight line. McGill stated that Alec was the center of the weird events and there must be some design in that. They went out to eat and the cars were wrecking all along their way, overwhelming the cops. Two people were unable to go past each other, they fought making the same motions and saying identical words. Many similar situations were happening all around. One of the women with intertwined umbrellas was Molly, the wife. Her mother's number was constantly dialed with no one on the line, and Alec's number was always busy, so Molly got worried. At that point Danny, the local policeman, started suspecting Alec. The three went out for dinner eventually and took Nat with them, who wanted to hear the story. Alec dropped his cigarettes out of the pack under the suspicious gaze of Danny and a lieutenant. In the restaurant the whole company got salty drinks which puzzled the bartender. When he tried to do the new ones, nothing came out of the shaker - everything inside turned into ice. The place suddenly started getting warmer and quieter.

These ones look impossible to Alec and therefore scare him, so he calls McGill for a consultation. Further evidence convinces Alec in him being the center of a huge mess. He is confused and tries to hide his failures from the overseers."}]}]}

But he was\n  <br/>\n  forgetting one tiny thing—like calls to like.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Peter Karson was dead. He had been dead for some time now, but\nthe dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face,\ntrickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop,\nfrom his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at\na queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow\nwhere his eyes had been.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   There was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the\nblood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great\nbanks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would\nnever come to life again.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   I rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as\nbefore: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not\nchanged, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold\nand alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like\nthe machinery, and like Peter.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   It was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what\nPeter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic,\neither. It was just an emptiness—a void that could not be filled by\neating or drinking.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   It was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise\nthan they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for\nreason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   But the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore.\nFor the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could\nnot solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within\nme, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly—something moved on the skin of my\ncheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   A tear was trickling down my cheek.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\nsatisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\n  <i>\n   Citadel\n  </i>\n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for—on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern—all the children of his brain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were flaring red headlines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n  <br/>\n  200 DEAD\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n  <br/>\n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\n </p>\n <p class=\"ph1\">\n  MOON SHIP DESTROYED\n  <br/>\n  IN TRANSIT\n  <br/>\n  NO COMMUNICATION FROM\n  <br/>\n  ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS\n  <br/>\n  STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS\n  <br/>\n  PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA\n  <br/>\n  WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\n </p>\n <p>\n  The item below the last one said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pacifica, June 7—The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time\nin fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n  <i>\n   superior to ourselves in every way\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\nago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\nin any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Will\n  </i>\n  we?\" he asked himself softly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's\nlaboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\na halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\nmechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\nHe mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\nin the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\nfar enough to admit him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\non her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\nblonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\nThen she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She frowned. \"Why, no—Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\nhours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\nyou know I haven't one—it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\nthere's trouble or not. What—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\nwalked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\npapers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\nand pressed the stud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\nsuddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lorelei caught her breath.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\nthe warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\ntransport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\nbeen dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\nyes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\ndisappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\nheartbeat they were gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\ndefiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\nflesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\nmen and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\njoined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\nhelpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\nhorrible than any cry of agony.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\nstrangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\nstreets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Lorelei buried her head on his chest, clutching at him desperately.\n\"Peter!\" she said faintly. \"Why do they broadcast such things?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They have to,\" he told her grimly. \"There will be panics and suicides,\nand they know it; but they have to do it. This isn't like a war, where\nthe noncombatants' morale has to be kept up. There aren't going to be\nany noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about\nthem, so that he can fight them—and then it may not be enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared\naway from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached\nout to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles\ntense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating\nup the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the\nrest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ...\nforty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted.\nThen they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone\nthrough the solid wall, or simply melted away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man and woman clung together, waiting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and\nother faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man\nscreamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty\ngurgle and died, leaving silence again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peter's lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms\nwere jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away\nfrom him and started toward the inner room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Wait here,\" he mouthed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don't go in there!\n  <i>\n   Peter!\n  </i>\n  \" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been\ncleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down\nthe narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal\ncages, and paused just short of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the\ndistorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his\nrange of vision.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,\nLorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the\nbroad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His\nglazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness\nstraight ahead of him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.\nIn a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,\nparalyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were\nrelaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread\nlegs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull\ngrew gradually flatter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless\npuddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond\nfear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said\nin a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,\nbut there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The\nears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips\nseemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There\nwere lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only\nthe eyes were alive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first\ntime he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,\nswaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled\nslowly....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't—Go back!\" The horrible,\nmindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\nHis insides writhed to thrust it out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\nfloor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\nit back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\nfingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\nthe room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Somebody said, \"Doctor!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei—\" but his mouth only\ntwitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried again. \"Doctor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him;\nin a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted\noddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,\nstarched odor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\npressed him back into the sheets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been a\nvery sick man.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked\naround him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He\nturned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\nstand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\nmilky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\nbefore he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't—fool me. It's been\n  <i>\n   more\n  </i>\n  —than three—months.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\nkept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\nout of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd\nbeen in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much\nsooner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\n\"Seeing that assistant of hers—it was enough to knock anybody out,\nespecially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with\n  <i>\n   them\n  </i>\n  for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know—you talked a lot. It's a\nmiracle you're alive, and rational.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why\nI haven't been able to see her.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to\ntake it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children,\nand a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go,\nas soon as you're well enough to be moved. We started digging in six\nmonths ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why?\" Peter whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arnold's strong jaw knotted. \"We're hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else\nhas failed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went on\nafter a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.\nIt didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't\neven take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\nwhen a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\none time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\ndidn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'd\nbeen annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's still\nsmoldering.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be\nan impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated\nareas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavate\nenough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the other\nthree-quarters will be dead, or worse.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You've got to be. You're part of our\nlast hope, you see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our last hope?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes. You're a scientist.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the\n  <i>\n   Citadel\n  </i>\n  . No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but,\n  <i>\n   maybe\n  </i>\n  , he\nthought,\n  <i>\n   there's a chance\n  </i>\n  ....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  It wasn't very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It lay\nthere in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more than\nfive hundred meters in diameter, where the\n  <i>\n   Citadel\n  </i>\n  was to have been a\nthousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving into\nthe hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled with\nthe latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead,\nthere was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough to\nlast a lifetime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there was\none other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solid\nmeters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmic\nrays, were gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, to\nthe left of the airlock—\n  <i>\n   The Avenger\n  </i>\n  . He stepped away now, and joined\nthe group a little distance away, silently waiting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lorelei said, \"You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Darling,\" he began wearily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't throw your life away! Give us time—there must be another way.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's no other way,\" Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as if\nhe could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.\n\"Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground,\nbut that's only delaying the end.\n  <i>\n   They\n  </i>\n  still come down here, only not\nas many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birth\nrate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures:\nwe're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're a\nmillion years too far back even to understand what they are or where\nthey came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook her\nslender body. But he went remorselessly on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. They\nmake tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes,\nor a dozen ears—or a better brain. Out of those millions of\npossible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. We\ncan't fight\n  <i>\n   them\n  </i>\n  , but a superman could. That's our only chance.\nLorelei—darling—don't you see that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She choked, \"But why can't you take me along?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. \"You know why,\" he\nsaid bitterly. \"Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos;\nthey change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven of\nstaying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful.\nI couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die,\ntoo. You'd be their murderer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he no\nlonger had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone\nout of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You'll\ncome back, Peter.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye.

Then his clawed fingers poised\nover the keys, hovered a moment, and thrust down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Acceleration pressed him deep into his chair. In the visiplate, the\nheavy doors that closed the tunnel above him flashed back, one by one.\nThe energy-charged screen flickered off to let him pass, and closed\nsmoothly behind him.

The great motors died, and\nthe silence pressed in about him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Already he could feel the invisible rays burning resistlessly through\nhis flesh as if it were water, shifting the cells of his body, working\nits slow, monstrous alchemy upon him. Peter waited until the changes\nwere unmistakably evident in his skin and hair, and then he smashed all\nthe mirrors in the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The embryos were pulsing with unnatural life, even in the suspended\nanimation of their crystal cells. One by one he allowed them to\nmature, and after weeks or years destroyed the monstrosities that came\nfrom the incubators. Time went by, meaninglessly. He ate when he was\nhungry, slept when his driving purpose let him, and worked unceasingly,\nsearching for the million-to-one chance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared sometimes through changed eyes at the tiny blue star that was\nEarth, wondering if the race he had left behind still burrowed in its\nworm-tunnels, digging deeper and deeper away from the sunlight. But\nafter a time he ceased even to wonder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And one changeling-child he did not destroy. He fed knowledge to its\neager brain, and watched it through the swift years, with a dawning\nhope....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Peter closed the diary. \"The rest you know, Robert,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I was that child. I am the millionth mutation you\nwere searching for.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your\nbrain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid's. You solve\ninstinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours\nof work. You are a superman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he\nstood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but\nlittle in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled\nover his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of\nflesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had\na tiny sixth finger on his left hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once\naccidentally drawn one of my talons across his face.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I've waited so\nlong—keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from\nyou, not telling you, even, about Earth until now—because I had to be\nsure. But now, the waiting is over.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're still there, I'm sure of it—the people, and the Invaders. You\ncan kill the Invaders, Robert.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive\nknowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we\nhad a saying: 'Fight fire with fire.' That is the way it will be with\nyou. You are completely, coldly logical, just as\n  <i>\n   they\n  </i>\n  are. You can\nunderstand them, and so you can conquer them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What—what did\nyou say?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I repeated it patiently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an\ninstant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his\nsuffering, but I could recognize it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just\nas the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the\nthings which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I\nwent to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as\nthe invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are\nmore nearly kin to me than your people.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Peter's eyes were dull, his limbs slumped. For a moment I thought that\nthe shock had deranged his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice trembled when he said, \"But if I ask you to kill them, and\nnot my people?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To do so would be illogical.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He waved his hands helplessly. \"Gratitude?\" he muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, you don't understand that, either.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he cried suddenly, \"But I am your friend, Robert!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I do not understand 'friend,'\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I did understand \"gratitude,\" a little. It was a reciprocal\narrangement: I did what Peter wished, so long as I did not actively\nwant to do otherwise, because he had done things for me. Very well,\nthen we must not go back. It was very simple, but I knew that he could\nnot comprehend it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to explain it to him, however. But he only stared at me, with\nan expression on his face that I had never seen there before, and that,\nsomehow, I did not like to see. It was disquieting, and so I hastened\nto the end that I knew was inevitable.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "68b25a55ece94644acbc50b3905aa760", "response_text": "Peter Karson has finished planning out the blueprint for the Citadel.

He then shakingly lights a cigarette and turns on the newsbox to see that an invader has appeared in Boston. More disasters are listed below, and the World Police announces that the Invaders have already begun terrorizing the world since they appeared twenty-four hours ago. Peter is doubtful that they can take down the Invaders and goes to Lorelei Cooper’s laboratory. Lorelei does not know what is happening because Harry and she have been working for thirty-six hours straight. She does not have a newsbox, but he tells her to turn on her scanner to see the news. The panel shows the Science City of Manhattan, but the Invaders have come and snatched up men and women. Slowly, two Invaders make their way to the Atlas building, where Peter and Lorelei are. He goes into the inner room, even though she yells at him not to go. The Invaders have reduced Harry to nothing but a puddle of flesh, and Peter begins to ask why they are doing this desperately. They whisper to him in a strange language; he suddenly realizes that Lorelei has followed him. She drops to the floor after looking at the Invaders, which makes Peter scream.

Although Dr. Arnold initially tells him that he has been in the hospital for three months, he eventually finds out that it has already been nine and a half months since he went into his coma. All of the survivors are underground because nobody knew how to kill the Invaders. Peter is considered their last hope because he is a scientist, and he thinks back to his plan of the Citadel.

The story moves to the past, when young Peter finished the project of 'Citadel' - a spaceship to set off to an orbit.

While imagining the greatness of the creation, Peter felt dread and saw a face staring at him outside the window, fifty stories up. The face was scary and inhuman, the body hung without support for a while and then disappeared. Everything around was normal and Peter was worried he had gone mad. Then he saw the red headlines in the newspapers about appearing invaders and disappearing people. Cities worldwide were attacked and the World Police were mobilizing. The news proclaimed that the greatest enemy was to be faced and defeated. Peter rushed downstairs to Lorelei's laboratory, who had been working without breaks and hadn't seen the news. After Peter's agonized pleas, Lorelei turned on the news and saw a video of people becoming an unrecognizable joined mass, helpless and suffering. Then the two saw their own building in the news and halted. Peter went towards the inner room despite Lorelei's protests. He saw two aliens staring at Harry, Lorelei's assistant, and turning him into a boneless mess. Peter was so shocked that he screamed \"why?\" and heard some incomprehensible whisper in his head in response. Suddenly, Peter saw that Lorelei had followed him and her body dropped to the floor. Peter screamed inhumanely loudly and faded. He woke up in a hospital, the doctor said he had been very sick for three months and that Lorelei was fine. When Peter kept asking, he finally learned that he had been in a coma for more than nine months because of the rather long contact he had had with the invaders. Lorelei was simply shocked and recovered much faster. Arnold, the doctor, finally decided that Peter was strong enough to learn the truth and told about the part of humanity hiding underground as killing the aliens turned out to be impossible. Peter was needed as a scientist. His 'Citadel' project contained everything necessary to live a lifetime, it was a new independent world to save the rest of humanity. So, it was renamed 'The Avenger' and finished, as life underground was not a solution but a delay. Lorelei was in despair because of Peter boarding the ship and wanted to follow, but the rays were strong and even Peter had low chances of staying alive. When 'The Avenger' reached orbit, Peter felt the rays burning his flesh and smashed the mirrors to allow the embryos to mature. After a long time Peter told the story to Robert, the mutation-child with a superior brain who could destroy the invaders. Robert refused to go to Earth as his brain was logical and saw no reasons to destroy the Invaders. Peter didn't understand and the inevitable end approached.

The narrator says that they do not regret doing so, but they are unable to explain their emotions as they feel a tear rolling down their cheek.

He suddenly hears a strange whisper within his brain, and he turns around to see a face with a shriveled body staring at him through the window. The creature slowly dissolves and disappears, and Peter is left stunned. He finds breaking news of invasions all over the world, murdering hundreds of civilians. The invaders, according to Secretary of the Council, are from outer space, and the World Police is attempting to destroy them. Peter rushes downstairs to find Lorelei, his lover, in the laboratory. She is unaware of the news, and upon seeing footage of the gruesome attacks, she is shocked, and they soon see the invaders approaching their building from the television.

Peter confronts the creatures but only hears foreign whispers, as Lorelei drops to the floor behind him. Peter lets out a scream, and wakes up in a hospital. The doctor tells him that he has been there in a coma for over nine months, and that Lorelei had recovered from shock. The doctor then tells Peter that society has moved to living underground in order to avoid the invaders; Peter, as a scientist, is their last hope. Later, Peter approaches the newly crafted spaceship, titled The Avenger, which lacks the typical shield to protect one from cosmic rays. Lorelei begs Peter not to go, but he believes it is necessary, and too much of a risk for Lorelei to join him. He boards the ship with the mission to create a \"superman\" to ultimately defeat the invaders; the plan is to allow the cosmic rays to mutate several embryos on board, hopefully creating a strong enough being. As The Avenger leaves and goes into orbit, Peter begins feeling the effects of the rays as his skin and hair mutates. As time passes, he allows the embryos to develop, destroying all but one. He raises the embryo as it develops into a person, and the story jumps many years later, as the child becomes a man named Robert. Peter had raised Robert, with a superior brain and logical ability, to be the defeater of the invaders. Informing Robert of the plan to return back to Earth, Robert surprisingly refuses. Peter is taken aback, and Robert explains that he is not able to comprehend the emotions that would lead him to kill the invaders and save Earthmen.

He doesn't have feeling, so he doesn't have compassion towards the humans to help them. Moreover, as the Invaders are easy for him to understand, he is rather on their side. He cares for Peter as much as he can, but his gratitude can't overcome his lack of desire to do something. After Peter's death, he can't feel emotions either but he feels some emptiness inside, which shows he has developed some warmth towards Peter. This emptiness has no reasons and no solutions, which puzzles Robert for the first time in his life.

Personally, he\nwas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his\ndotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the\nPottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and\nhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers—Koltan, eldest\nand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their\ntreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in\nthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are\nthese Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength\nand our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may\ncome and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the\nfame and fortune of the House of Masur.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  a damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's\nphilosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in\nLor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran\nrather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,\nwhich the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting\nto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a\nvery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his\nown counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough\nfor him. He would report when the time was ripe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference\nwas expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his\nelders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building\nthat ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means\nof transport.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret\nconclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it.\nThe speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,\nremember your position in the family.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his\nhead than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of\nthe clay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him\na beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough\nthing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in\ntheir desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they\ndid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought\nabout the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way\nof metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could\nfigure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of\nhis brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of\ncourse, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  By and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange\nmetal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the\ncity, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of\ntile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the\npeople to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much\ntoo quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to\nbe desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of\nZur. It required but the cooperation—an excellent word, that—of all\nZurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in\neffect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered,\nfor it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a\nwhaling for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was also some talk going around about agreements made between\nthe Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one\nthing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a\nnewspaper, was unknown on Zur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously,\nnone had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had\ntried. The anti-Earthmen Faction—in any culture complex, there is\nalways an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor—crowed\nhappily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships\narrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was\npractically acrawl with Earthmen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called\n\"corporations\"—Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The\nobject of the visit was trade.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian\ncity of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took\nsome time for the news to spread.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the\npottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an\naluminum pot at him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A pot. I bought it at the market.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my\nsubstance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I\nsay!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The pretty young wife laughed at him. \"Up to your ears in clay, no\nwonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen\nare selling them everywhere. They're much better than our old clay\npots; they're light and easy to handle and they don't break when\ndropped.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What good is it?\" asked Zotul, interested. \"How will it hold heat,\nbeing so light?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Earthmen don't cook as we do,\" she explained patiently. \"There is\na paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have\nto design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new\ntype of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do\nyou need a whole new stove for one little pot?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan\nwill have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are\nbuying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman\nsaid so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go\nback to cooking with your old ones.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Earthman took them in trade—one reason why the new ones are so\ncheap. There isn't a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you\nwill have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use\nthem.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul\nstamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would\naccommodate the terrestrial pots very well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Koltan put the model into production.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Orders already are pouring in like mad,\" he said the next day. \"It\nwas wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am\nsorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to\ndo well by us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with\nthe demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a\nmillion had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the\nhundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every\nland.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  In the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth.\nOne was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever\ndreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of\nthe Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines poured from\nit in a fantastic stream. The populace fervidly brushed up on its\nscanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by\nthe novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book—a primer in the Lorian\nlanguage—and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the\nbrothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Moreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire—more than enough\nin value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur—and set up\ntelegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent.\nWithin five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major\ncity on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed\nthe instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph. And the business\nof the House of Masur continued to look up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As I have always said from the beginning,\" chortled Director Koltan,\n\"this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and\nespecially for the House of Masur.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You didn't think so at first,\" Zotul pointed out, and was immediately\nsorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his\nunthinkable impertinence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their\nproduction of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per\ncent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves\ngreatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but\ntheir business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from\nEarth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  About this time, plastic utensils—dishes, cups, knives, forks—made\ntheir appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the\nnewfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for\neverything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade.\nWhat they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They\ndestroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of\nMasur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Trembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan\ncalled an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his\nsenile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man\nmight still have a little wit left that could be helpful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine\nour business,\" and he read off the figures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before,\nand will result in something even better for us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly\nsubsided.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior\nterrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that\nsells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their\neyes, we can be ruined.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while\nFather Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got\nnowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom\nof your trouble, but the\n  <i>\n   things\n  </i>\n  of Earth. Think of the telegraph and\nthe newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth.\nThe merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these\nnewspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are\nintrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to\nbuy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you\nmight also have advertisements of your own.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising\nfrom the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the\nadvertisements of the Earthmen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the\nbrothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several\nthings had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal\nrest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had\nprocured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which\nthey found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What\nthey did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered\nin the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working\nunder supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil\nregions to every major and minor city on Zur.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first\nterrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in\ngas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business\nwas gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas\nat a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the\nbrothers Masur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an\nenergetic protest to the governor of Lor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen\nfor a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and\ndeparted from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of\nMasur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that\nmuch new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan\nblackly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio\nreceiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was\nloaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other\nradio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the\nnatural follow-up in its campaign of advertising—radio programs—with\ncommercials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or\nthey would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not\npaused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be\nmodern—keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing\nall in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a\ngreat, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in\nten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they\nare even bringing\n  <i>\n   autos\n  </i>\n  to Zur!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these\nhitherto unheard-of vehicles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the\nEarthmen are taking care of that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves\nthat they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses\nand street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new\nhighways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made\nyet.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people\nbought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways\nwere constructed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants\nand began to manufacture Portland cement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of\ncourse, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either\ntile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff\nmade far better road surfacing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot\nhandle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising\nCouncil.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is that?\" asked Koltan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as\nyours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain\nin the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with\nit. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to\nZotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling\nhim in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the\npurpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they\nhad to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated\non their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not\nsurprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to\nmake room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved\nwith something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering\nnew automobiles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now\nthat they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached\nwith desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and\nthey were the envied ones of Zur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands\njovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a\nbetter look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual\nwith genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in\nthe baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for\nan indefinite sense of alienness about him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping\nZotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you\nstraightened out in no time.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this\noccasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been\nmade upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in\nthe world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab\nMasur—Divinity protect him—departed this life to collect his greater\nreward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and\nbones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone\nis the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and\nall because of new things coming from Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come\nto me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has,\nwe're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth—always to\ndo right by the customer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for\ndamages.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense\nfortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your\ntrouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do\nyou own an automobile?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes\nthe music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the\nbargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these\nluxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off\nwith a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car\nfrom the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered\nand installed in your home.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to\nyou absolutely free—a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is\nthat you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to\nmake profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the\nGalaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out\nthe full program takes time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our\nextremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise,\nbut sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the\nmotto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it\nwas no more than fair to pay transportation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, \"How much does the freight cost?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Broderick told him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is\nsixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the\nmerchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering\nthe cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together\nhave so much money any more.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you\ncredit!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the\nrich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the\ninvolutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that\nmight have had a discouraging effect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting.\nZotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do\nto get credit?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our\nEasy Payment Plan.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for\nmyself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each\nof your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is\nall there is to it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul\nwrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will\nhave the figures.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul\npointed this out politely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all,\nyou get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be\npaid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight.\nThis small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our\nplant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You\nwill start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain\nparts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local\nmanufacture to help bring prices down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We haven't the equipment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only\na quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial\ncompany.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Zotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman,\nwon over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter\ninterest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth.\nThese, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the\nEarthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the\nnew concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a\nterrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from\nthe crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit.\nThe food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges,\nserved up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the\nwinter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though\nthey had gas-fired central heating.\n </p>\n <p>\n  About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric\ngenerators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of\nelectrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason,\nbatteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to\nbuy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan.\nThey had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric\nfans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could\npossibly sell them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but\nmeantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option.\nThe Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The\nEarthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because\nit was so much more efficient—and to lower prices, which was Earth's\nunswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded.\nBroderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets\nwere delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and\nmaintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth\nhad them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth,\nbut to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush\nbusiness.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade\nand a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this\nbackward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was\nslow, but it was extremely sure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less\nmoney and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television\nkept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the\npangs of impoverishment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul\ndesigned and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons\nwere a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold\nthem for less.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any\nmore, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with\nfists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some\ncontracts to continue operating.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr.\nBroderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him.\nWould he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint\nof toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He\nlooked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of\nmaking it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything\nattached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are\nattached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that—yet. We\nwill only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your\npottery to us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of\nbeating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was\nsomewhat comforted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the\ngovernor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of\nMasur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is\ntime for the government to do something for us.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of\nconfusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for\nan interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It\nwas remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female\nterrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men\ncovetous and Zurian women envious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting\nyou.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Me?\" marveled Zotul.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor\nof Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a\nfriendly smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick,\nthe Earthman.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Broderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted\nwith your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are\nabout to lose our plant.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away\nfrom you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and\nrichest on Zur, it has taken a long time—the longest of all, in fact.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have\nbought you out.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Our government....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could\nnot pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took\nthem over, just as we are taking you over.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything\non Zur?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Even your armies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\n  <i>\n   why\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Broderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared\ndown moodily into the street.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You don't know what an overcrowded world is like,\" he said. \"A street\nlike this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossible\non Earth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it's mobbed,\" protested Zotul. \"It gave me a headache.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And to us it's almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth has\nmade us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only\nhabitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least\npopulous worlds and—well, buy them out and move in.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And after that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Broderick smiled gently. \"Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry\nwith yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians\nnor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul sat in silent thought. \"But you did not have to buy us out. You\nhad the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could\nhave been yours alone.\" He stopped in alarm. \"Or am I suggesting an\nidea that didn't occur to you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with\nmemory. \"We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method\ncauses more distress than we like to inflict, but it's better—and more\nsure—than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is\nfinished, we can repair the dislocations.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Slow but sure.\" Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the\nshoulder. \"Don't worry. You'll have your job back, the same as always,\nbut you'll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur\nare equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That's why we had\nto break down your caste system.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zotul's eyes widened. \"And that is why my brothers did not beat me when\nI failed!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course.

The business specializes in pottery and clay manufacturing for Zur. The family gathers as they deliberate the upcoming arrival of Earthmen. Some of the brothers express frustration that the Earthmen will be landing among the Thorabians rather than in Zur, disrupting their plan to steal the precious, scarce metals off their ship. Zotul, the youngest of the brothers, discourages the plan, saying that the Earthmen's ship is their only way of transport. After the meeting, Zotul ponders what other benefits the Earthmen could serve. The Earthmen eventually arrive at Zur, parading the streets and making speeches, and leaving shortly after. They return with multiple ships and establish corporations all over Zur. One day, Zotul's wife brings home a metal pot, which she had bought from Earthmen; she tells him that they are high in demand and that a new type of stove is essential to use them. Zotul protests, but later designs a ceramic stove, which becomes a successful development in their business. Earthmen continue introducing more technology to Zur, including a printing press and telegraphs. Zotul notes internally that though the business has made profit, it is dependent upon the pots from Earth. The business quickly begins declining, with sales dropping. They attempt to advertise their business, but advertisement has become fully occupied by Earth. After ten years, during which Koltan has passed on, the Masur business has dwindled. The brothers decide to go to the governor of Lor, who tells them that the developments are all beneficial, informing them of a new production of highways. The brothers are optimistic that they would be able to use their clay for the roads, but Earthmen begin using cement. The governor then refers the brothers to Earth's Merchandising Council, where Zotul meets Kent Broderick, where he expresses sympathy about the status of the Masur business and offers them the luxuries brought by Earthmen, completely free except for the cost of freight. The cost, however, is more than the brothers could ever afford, and so Broderick sets them up with a credit system, as well as a contract for the family to supply Earthmen with ceramic parts. The brothers enjoy their luxury, but it is short lived, as their contract expires and they find themselves in debt. Zotul then revisits the governor, who ends up being Broderick. Broderick informs Zotul that Earth has bought them, and every business in Zur, out, and that they own everything. Broderick tells Zotul that the family will work for Earth now, and that Earth will fully conquer Zur.

Soon, more Earthmen arrive on the planet. They land a ship in every city on Zur and begin trading basic items. When they trade, they take the Zurian version of their goods and destroy them. Zotul is forced to design new stoves for the new cookware. Zotul and his brothers are initially able to make a great profit selling their new ceramic stoves. \n\nThe Earthmen continue to bring new inventions that the Zurian population do not possess. They bring new communication devices like the printing press, then radios, and eventually television sets. Eventually, Zotul and his brother’s operations are unable to compete with the Earthmen’s goods. Their profits drop to abysmal levels in all of their industries. Zotul is told by his brothers to go make a formal complaint. He goes to the headquarters of the Merchandising Council where he meets Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council. Broderick acts very nice to Zotul and appears to only have good intentions. Broderick promises to help Zotul and offers to give him many luxurious gifts that Zotul states he cannot afford. Broderick explains to Zotul that is of no issue and he can offer him credit. After only explaining the good parts of credit to Zotul, Zotul goes and convinces his brothers to sign up for the credit system. In addition, Broderick gives them a contract to manufacture some goods for the Earthmen. However, the contract does not last long and the Earthmen build their own plant. As a result, the House of Masur is unable to keep up with its debts. Zotul’s brothers express their anger and accuse Zotul of getting them into incredible poverty. In an effort to remedy the situation, Zotul goes to the Council House where he does not find Mr. Broderick but a man named Mr. Siwicki. Mr. Siwicki informs him that the Earthmen will repossess everything him and his brothers own if they do not pay their debts. Zotul’s brothers are so stunned by the news that they do not even beat him. In a last-ditch effort, Zotul goes to the governor’s palace for help. There he finds Broderick is now the governor. Broderick then informs Zotul that the Earthmen were slowly taking ownership of Zur away from the Zurian to then move in an attempt to peacefully take over the planet. The ultimate goal is to mix with the native population and then form a cohesive one. However, the Zurian caste system had to be first broken down.

Morvan thinks that the Earthmen could have come to Lor, and Singula implies that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen. Zotul tries to explain that they cannot take the Earthmen’s method of transport away from them, but the other brothers tell him to be quiet. The Earthmen arrive at Lor and are impressed with the city, and they communicate through interpreters. Some agreements between the Lorian government and the Earthmen are made. Although the anti-Earthmen Faction is happy that the Earthmen are gone, the visitors come back and establish corporations to engage in trade. When Zotul comes home, his wife Lania shows him an aluminum pot. She tells him that the Earthmen are selling these items cheap. She tells him that he will need to design a new ceramic stove for a dozen pots. He beats his wife but goes off to design the stove anyways; the Masurs begin to profit more than ever from the porcelain stoves. The Earthmen also bring other items such as the printing press, copper wire for telegraph lines, and plastic cutlery. The Masur family ceramics are slowly being replaced. Kalrab concludes that the items from Earth are the main reason.  The Earthmen begin to lay pipelines after the discovery of crude oil and natural gas. The Masur stove business is also gone after ten years; the brothers plan to protest to the governor of Lor. They see the Earthmen are building more structures, such as an assembly plant for radio receiving sets.

The Earthmen parade through Zur, proclaiming the intention to do great things and asking for cooperation. After a while, many more ships come from Earth to every Zurian city to establish \"corporations\" for trade. Zotul's wife buys a set of cheap aluminum pots at the market, which are being bought by all the housewives as they are better than those from clay. New pots require completely different stoves and Zotul has to design such. Koltan, the elder brother, puts the model into production as the demand is high. The Masurs flourish with the new business and depend on the metal pots from Earth, as the production of their own falls. The Earthmen keep introducing new things like telegraph lines and printing presses. The Earthmen find a great deal of metals, crude oil and natural gas, and sell it to the Zurians themselves. Further introduction of plastic utensils undermines the Masur's business completely. They head to the governor, who talks about the benefits of new culture and upcoming autos and highways. The Earthmen introduce cement and the hopes for tile business go down as well. The complaints are redirected to the Merchandising Council set by the Earthmen, where Zotul is met by Broderick. The man is sympathetic to the brothers’ poverty, but he can only grant Zotul a gas range, a gas-fired furnace and a car, a luxury only a few can afford and everyone envies. The goal of the Earthmen is to spread technology through the galaxy, so Broderick only asks Zotul to pay for the freight, which is a huge sum, and, therefore, can only be in credit for the family.

To be able to buy the new technologies, the Zurians get credits and work for the Earthmen to pay them off. Then the contracts are cancelled and the people have to sell their businesses. Therefore, the Earthmen gain control over the whole planet.

He gives Zotul and his brother contracts stating they the Earthmen will use their facility for some of their manufacturing purposes. This works out really well for the House of Masur until the Earthmen eventually build their own facility and manufacture the same product but in a cheaper manner, undercutting all profits the House of Masur could make. Even further, Broderick gets Zotul and his brothers to voluntarily go into debt so that they could own the luxurious items that the Earthmen were bringing to Zur.

The golden\nMoon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night when\nthis is to happen.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc's\narthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. \"No argument. Sure,\nup we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in the\nteeth!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose,\none finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned that\nduring all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled,\nbut I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winos\nin Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have been\nwanted for the murder of a North American Mountie.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame,\nlayered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side.\nOne of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of the\ngreasy collar of the human.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope you'll forgive him, sir,\" I said, not meeting the man's eyes.\n\"He's my father and very old, as you can see.\" I laughed inside at the\nabsurd, easy lie. \"Old events seem recent to him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight.\n\"'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. But\nGreat-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl.\nSharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse three\ndoors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happen\nif we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, for\nall I knew.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Martians approaching the corner were sensing at Doc and me. They\nwere just cheap tourists slumming down on Skid Row. I hated tourists\nand especially I hated Martian tourists because I especially hated\nMartians. They were\n  <i>\n   aliens\n  </i>\n  . They weren't\n  <i>\n   men\n  </i>\n  like Doc and me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I realized what was about to happen. It was foolish and awful and\ntrue. I was going to have one of mine at the same time Doc was having\nhis. That was bad. It had happened a few times right after I first\nfound him, but now it was worse. For some undefinable reason, I felt we\nkept getting closer each of the times.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried not to think about it and helped Doc through the fly-specked\nflophouse doors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tubercular clerk looked up from the gaudy comics sections of one of\nthose little tabloids that have the funnies a week in advance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he said mechanically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We'll use one bed,\" I told him. \"I'll give you twenty cents.\" I felt\nthe round hard quarter in my pocket, sweaty hand against sticky lining.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he played it back for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doc was quivering against me, his legs boneless.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We can always make it over to the mission,\" I lied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The clerk turned his upper lip as if he were going to spit. \"Awright,\nsince we ain't full up. In\n  <i>\n   ad\n  </i>\n  vance.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I placed the quarter on the desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Give me a nickel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The clerk's hand fell on the coin and slid it off into the unknown\nbefore I could move, what with holding up Doc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've got your nerve,\" he said at me with a fine mist of dew. \"Had a\nquarter all along and yet you Martian me down to twenty cents.\" He saw\nthe look on my face. \"I'll give you a\n  <i>\n   room\n  </i>\n  for the two bits. That's\nbetter'n a bed for twenty.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knew I was going to need that nickel.\n  <i>\n   Desperately.\n  </i>\n  I reached across\nthe desk with my free hand and hauled the scrawny human up against the\nregister hard. I'm not as strong in my hands as Doc, but I managed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Give me a nickel,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What nickel?\" His eyes were big, but they kept looking right at me.\n\"You don't have any nickel. You don't have any quarter, not if I say\nso. Want I should call a cop and tell him you were flexing a muscle?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I let go of him. He didn't scare me, but Doc was beginning to mumble\nand that\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  scare me. I had to get him alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where's the room?\" I asked.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet\nhigh. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino\nsinging on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't\nhave any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face\nto shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the\nbedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning\neyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so\ndirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy\nscalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's\ngas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed\nto shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I\ndidn't need to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered,\nuncovered floor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a\njagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it\nan unreal distortion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doc began to mumble louder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knew I had to move.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I\nmoved.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found\nmy notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both\nmy mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I\nconcentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their\nhabit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were\nsuddenly distinguishable.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Outsider\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Thoth\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Dyzan\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Seven\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Hsan\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Beyond Six, Seven, Eight\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Two boxes\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Ralston\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Richard\nWentworth\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Jimmy Christopher\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Kent Allard\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Ayem\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   Oh, are\n  </i>\n  ...\n  <i>\n   see\n  </i>\n  ....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  His voice rose to a meaningless wail that stretched into non-existence.\nThe pen slid across the scribbled face of the notebook and both dropped\nfrom my numb hands. But I knew. Somehow, inside me,\n  <i>\n   I knew\n  </i>\n  that these\nwords were what I had been waiting for. They told everything I needed\nto know to become the most powerful man in the Solar Federation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That wasn't just an addict's dream. I knew who Doc was. When I got\nto thinking it was just a dream and that I was dragging this old man\naround North America for nothing, I remembered who he was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I remembered that he was somebody very important whose name and work I\nhad once known, even if now I knew him only as Doc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pain was a pendulum within me, swinging from low throbbing bass to high\nscreaming tenor. I had to get out and get some. But I didn't have a\nnickel. Still, I had to get some.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I crawled to the door and raised myself by the knob, slick with greasy\ndirt. The door opened and shut—there was no lock. I shouldn't leave\nDoc alone, but I had to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was starting to cry. He didn't always do that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I listened to him for a moment, then tested and tasted the craving that\ncrawled through my veins. I got back inside somehow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doc was twisting on the cot, tears washing white streaks across his\nface. I shoved Doc's face up against my chest. I held onto him and let\nhim bellow. I soothed the lanks of soiled white hair back over his\nlumpy skull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shut up at last and I laid him down again and put his arm back\nacross his face. (You can't turn the light off and on in places like\nthat. The old wiring will blow the bulb half the time.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't remember how I got out onto the street.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  She was pink and clean and her platinum hair was pulled straight back,\ndrawing her cheek-bones tighter, straightening her wide, appealing\nmouth, drawing her lean, athletic, feminine body erect. She was wearing\na powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the\nupper half of her legs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it\nwasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that.\nIt was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody\nwould help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they\nthink you are blotto.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?\" I kept my eyes down.\nI couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. \"Just a dime for a\ncup of coffee.\" I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two\nand a half.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used,\nperhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. \"Do you want\nit for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized\nthat anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate\ntourists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just coffee, ma'am.\" She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to\ncall her that. \"A little more for food, if you could spare it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll buy you a dinner,\" she said carefully, \"provided I can go with\nyou and see for myself that you actually eat it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I felt my face flushing red. \"You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum\nlike me, ma'am.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll be seen with you if you really want to eat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice\nwhatever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Okay,\" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was\npale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands\nto feel its warmth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool\nbeside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but\nthere she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible\n  <i>\n   tourist\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could\ndo. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and\nwas able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt—good.\nNot abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of\nexhilaration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was what coffee did for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was a caffeine addict.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Earth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but\nI knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected\nmy metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the\nsame, but the\n  <i>\n   need\n  </i>\n  ran as deep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure\nsensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the\nprice of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles\nwith a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in\nthem—not enough, never enough, but better than nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now what do you want to eat?\" the woman asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human—an\n  <i>\n   Earth\n  </i>\n  human. I was a\n  <i>\n   man\n  </i>\n  , of course, not an\n  <i>\n   alien\n  </i>\n  like a Martian.\nEarthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an\nEarthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That\nproved it, didn't it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hamburger,\" I said. \"Well done.\" I knew that would probably be all\nthey had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but\nthen I didn't have the local prejudices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how\nclean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so\ndirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every\nhour for the rest of my life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails\nand raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba,\nalmost in a single movement of my jaws.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Several other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a\nglass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting\nfor me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Could I have a few to take with me, miss?\" I pleaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I\njust felt it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',\" she\nsaid. \"I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. \"No, miss,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's Miss Casey—Vivian Casey,\" she corrected. She was a\nschoolteacher, all right. No other girl would introduce herself as Miss\nLast Name. Then there was something in her voice....\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's your name?\" she said to me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I choked a little on a bite of stale bun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  a name,\n  <i>\n   of course\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and\nthought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the\ngirl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  my name.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like\nwaterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.\n\"What do you think of this?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Dear Acolyte R. I. S.\n  </i>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, \"The Scarlet\nBook\" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the Universe.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Name\n  </i>\n  : ........................\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Address\n  </i>\n  : .....................\n </p>\n <p>\n  The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner\nand Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was\ntrying to pull it out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a\ncup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and\na pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five—if the\nlady didn't pay you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that\nbill out of your hand?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman\nput down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant\nbar, smoothing it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the\nsidewalk, only in the doorways.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  First I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon\nlight was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window\nsomewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and\nthe one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had\nchanged around—prayer came from the left, song from the right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a\n  <i>\n   thing\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  My heart hammered at my lungs. I\n  <i>\n   knew\n  </i>\n  this last time had been\ndifferent. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time\nDoc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a\nstart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom.\nHis strong hands had unraveled some of the bed \"springs\"—metal\nwebbing—and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had\ndissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a\nmeaningful whole.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I\nbecame lost.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of\nhamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any\nhungry rats out of the walls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I knelt beside Doc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"An order, my boy, an order,\" he whispered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen,\nbefore dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook\nagainst the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Concentrate,\" Doc said hoarsely. \"Concentrate....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of\nconcentration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The words \"First Edition\" were what I was thinking about most.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The heavy-set man in the ornate armchair was saying, \"The bullet struck\nme as I was pulling on my boot....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was kneeling on the floor of a Victorian living room. I'm quite\nfamiliar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these\nmonths—time travel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled\ndressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and\nwhitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird!

I staggered, but\nmanaged to hold onto the gun and stand up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,\" I warned him,\n\"and I'll kill the girl.\" Martians were supposed to be against the\ndestruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but\nit was worth a try.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Kevin,\" Andre said, \"why don't you take a bath?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I\ntried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no\nmatter how often I bathed.

SMITH\n </p>\n <p>\n  Illustrated by DILLON\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p class=\"ph3\">\n  <i>\n   No one, least of all Martin, could dispute\n   <br/>\n   that a man's life should be guarded by his\n   <br/>\n   kin—but by those who hadn't been born yet?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother\ndisappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way\nof disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better\noff without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this\ngood while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin\nhad never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of\nsoldiers—enemies and allies, both—that had engulfed the country in\nsuccessive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble\nthat way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story\nabout her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really\nwas his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell\nhim to call her \"\n  <i>\n   Aunt Ninian\n  </i>\n  \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd\nbeen around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought\nmaybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little\ntoo crazy for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer\nwith Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry\ninstead of mopping up the floor with him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why\ndo you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin\nConrad?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and\nkilling you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.\nYou wouldn't understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're damn right. I\n  <i>\n   don't\n  </i>\n  understand. What's it all about in\nstraight gas?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you\nget older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the\nway they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he\nknew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to\nthink it was disgusting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up\nthe place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in\nthe streets—especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding\nto know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew\nhow to give them the cold shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming\nto school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very\nregularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and\nshe went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and\nwould make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so\nhard inside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and\nhired a private tutor for him. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin\nhad to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step\nwithout hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people\nthought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little\nbetter than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There\nwere an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the\nsame way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty\ndumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical\napplication to go by,\" she told him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out\nwrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what\nshe'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a\nspectator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,\nNinian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that\nmushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where\nintensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she\ndeclared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And keep an eye on him she did—she or a rather foppish young man who\ncame to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle\nRaymond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From time to time, there were other visitors—Uncles Ives and\nBartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many\nmore—all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play\nwith the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents\nwould have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if\na one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be\nsomething pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as\nconspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she\nwas supposed to know better than he did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,\nwarm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by\nmore luxury than he knew what to do with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There\nwere tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every\ninch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls\nwere mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time\nand a freezer well stocked with food—somewhat erratically chosen, for\nNinian didn't know much about meals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a\nneat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other\nkids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given\nhim enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd\nnearly killed him—but then there had also been times when she'd hugged\nand kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all\nshe could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if\nrespectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.\nThey made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry\nout a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,\nin their minds and in their talk they were living in another world—a\nworld of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the\ngovernment service or the essential professions. And they seemed to\nthink even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than\nactually doing anything with the hands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;\neverything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear\npretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was\nno devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of\nnormal living.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of\nthem were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.\nThey came from the future.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had\npromised five years before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an\nidealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and\nrather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery\nstore or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized\nand he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear\nglasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,\nand his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having\ncarefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting\nthe not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond\ncontinued. \"Which\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  distressing—though, of course, it's not as\nif they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about\npassing laws to do away with the—well, abuses and things like that,\nand I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,\nConrad is so impatient.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've told you—our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond\nsnapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.\nBut remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same\npeople ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd\nyears of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to\nunderstand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.\nAll that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those\nworlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that\nexpensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how\nwould they manage to live?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how\ndo\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for\nyou,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the\npast and think in the future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but\nif you will persist in these childish interruptions—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of\nhis descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated\nyoung people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and\nconsiderable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And\nhe had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the\nlot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more\nfrightening—his race had lost something vital.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,\nRaymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to\nfeel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for\nthe fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we\nmight never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous—his feeling\nguilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his\ngreat-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held\naccountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this\nor don't you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for\nhimself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time\ntransmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally\nofficious—always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to\nbe hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always\ndesperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'\nassistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back\nin time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,\nthere would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never\nget to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the\n  <i>\n   adolescent\n  </i>\n  way,\" he said, \"to do\naway with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole\nsociety in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps\nhe built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such\nmatters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea\nof eliminating our great-grandfather—because our great-grandfather\nwas such a\n  <i>\n   good\n  </i>\n  man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip\ncurled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of\nhis great-grandfather's father—who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty\nworthless character.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you\nmustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in\na rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us—the other\ncousins and me—held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it\nwas our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He\nbeamed at Martin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in\n  <i>\n   eliminating\n  </i>\n  me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really\nsuppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer\naltruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the\ncousins possessed to a consternating degree.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long\nago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's\nassistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,\n\"and—ah—induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Induced\n  </i>\n  , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the\nuse of the iron maiden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you\nnight and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made\nour counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go—and here\nwe are!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see,\" Martin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed\nout defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good\nthing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary\nconveniences, plus some handy anachronisms—I don't see what more you\ncould ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of\ncourse Ninian\n  <i>\n   was\n  </i>\n  a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any\nlittle thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our\nera has completely disposed of the mercantiles—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,\nwe'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.\nOstentation—that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,\nthe more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might\nas well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this\nwretched historical stint.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel\ncuriously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a\nremote kind of way, he had no fondness for her—or she, he knew, for\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in\nexile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer\nthan yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat\ngovernment.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to\ngo all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we\naren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the\nsad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy\nsentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,\nyou know.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring\nof alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to\nprotect me when he comes?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said\nwith modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's\ncombination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no\ndoubt, was a perfectly genuine—and lethal—weapon. \"And we've got a\nrather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring\nwhich, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was\ndubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this\n  <i>\n   house\n  </i>\n  ,\nbut do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this\n  <i>\n   time\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never fear—it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory\nguarantee and all that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have\none of those guns, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that\nmyself!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried—tears at\nher own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful\nat understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding\nhim. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the\ncheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and\nthat she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the\nvery last.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The\nsite proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a\ndozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether\nthis had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his\ndescendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as\nMartin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible\nconvenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,\ncarefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man\nfrom the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,\nMartin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become\ndulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle—\"architecturally\ndreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously\ntypical\"—impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level\naquarium.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to\ngo with a castle.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place\nseem safer somehow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more\nnervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that\nstood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because\nseveral times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with\nthe ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,\nuntil Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the\nhigher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably\narose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At\nleast twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of\ntheir vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy\nsuch occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of\nentertainment.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond\ncommented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,\nunless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one\njust—well, drifts along happily.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we\ncould take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you\nmade up your mind what you want to be?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.\n\"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't\nknow how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.\nSubconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might\ninvent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from\nparticularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,\nto be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over\nagain, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.\nBesides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of\ntheir times.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much\ndifference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that\nother time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a chilly silence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be\nthankful we've saved you from\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  !\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent\nsecond-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first\nrank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost\npurely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was\nfear—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and\nwalk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for\nthe sake of an ideal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty\npictures.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the\ndescendants\n  <i>\n   cousin\n  </i>\n  —next assumed guardianship. Ives took his\nresponsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged\nto have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received\ncritical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest\nsale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not\ninterested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying\nyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\nas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\nman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\nchange of air and scenery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented\nspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.\nTourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,\nwhich Martin christened\n  <i>\n   The Interregnum\n  </i>\n  . They traveled about from sea\nto ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\ntrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in fragments; the\nnearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\nsame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\nmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\nlargely because they could spend so much time far away from the\ncontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\nthey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\n  <i>\n   The Interregnum\n  </i>\n  . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\nthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\ntime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\nthey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\nship, giving each other parties and playing an\n  <i>\n   avant-garde\n  </i>\n  form of\nshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\nended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\nhaving got advance information about the results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\nwhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\nthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\nhis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone\ntogether; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come\nfrom. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely\naccurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth\nproper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people\nleft on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly\ninterbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue\nof their distinguished ancestry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately\nplanned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.\nEverything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been\ndeported.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two\nof them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse\nof some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except\nfor officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added\nregretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected\nhimself. \"Maybe it\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets\nfor us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.\nBombed. Very thorough job.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified—interested,\neven.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after\na pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the\npeople—I expect you could call them people—there. Still—\" he smiled\nshamefacedly—\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,\ncould I?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except\nConrad, and even he—\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better\nway out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything\nwill work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to—to anything,\nif it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he\ncouldn't even seem to care.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin\nhad gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost\nwished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.\nBut he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n </p>\n <p>\n  He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize\nthe basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have\nbeen Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one\nbitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from\nthe future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to\ntake a medical degree—but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was\nburied in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the\ncontinent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were\ndressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond\nread the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical\ncousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy\nabout the entire undertaking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over\nIves, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Martin disagreed.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The ceaseless voyaging began again.\n  <i>\n   The Interregnum\n  </i>\n  voyaged to every\nocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\na while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\ncame to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\napart as the different oceans.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\nhis life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\nthe young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\ntheir elders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\nin the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\nfor fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that\nera than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore,\nand then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\nthe sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and\nsometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\nthat his other work lacked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\nsomewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\nhe could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\njourney. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\npurpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\ncousin's utter disgust.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\ndo,\" the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\nscraping bottom now—advised.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\ndisillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\npurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\nHowever, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\nand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\nunderstand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\nthe current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\na very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time—waiting\nuntil we're off guard. And then—pow!—he'll attack!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\nmember of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\never have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\nconversation, anyhow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\nhis ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\nhave every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\ngiven up carrying a gun long ago.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so\n  <i>\n   The Interregnum\n  </i>\n  voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\nout in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel\nand man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\ntime.\n  <i>\n   The Interregnum\n  </i>\n  roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\npassengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\nbore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Perhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air—perhaps it\nwas the sheltered life—but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was a\nhundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when\nthe family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no\nhope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to\ntheir progenitor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and\nRaymond—all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,\nspilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the\ndeck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had\nbeen spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming young\npeople—all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed\nnever to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see\nrelief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their\nresponsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal\npity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered so\nirretrievably.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  There was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn't\na strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it in\nthe looking glass when he was a young man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must be Conrad,\" Martin called across the cabin in a voice that\nwas still clear. \"I've been looking forward to meeting you for some\ntime.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other cousins whirled to face the newcomer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're too late, Con,\" Raymond gloated for the whole generation. \"He's\nlived out his life.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But he hasn't lived out his life,\" Conrad contradicted. \"He's lived\nout the life\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  created for him. And for yourselves, too.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his\nlineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you realize even yet,\" Conrad went on, \"that as soon as he goes,\nyou'll go, too—present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go up\nin the air like puffs of smoke?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What do you mean?\" Ninian quavered, her soft, pretty face alarmed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Martin answered Conrad's rueful smile, but left the explanations up to\nhim. It was his show, after all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because you will never have existed,\" Conrad said. \"You have no right\nto existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time,\nso he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married,\n  <i>\n   have\nchildren\n  </i>\n  ....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I knew from the very beginning,\" Conrad finished, \"that I didn't\nhave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroy\nyourselves.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't understand,\" Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of the\ncousins closest to him. \"What does he mean, we have never existed?\nWe're here, aren't we? What—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Shut up!\" Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. \"You don't seem\nsurprised.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man grinned. \"I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better to\nthrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? He\nhad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him—to\nwatch and wait and keep out of things—and that was the role he would\nplay.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You knew all the time and you didn't tell us!\" Raymond spluttered.\n\"After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you instead\nof a criminal.... That's right,\" he snarled, \"a criminal! An alcoholic,\na thief, a derelict! How do you like that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sounds like a rich, full life,\" Martin said wistfully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, he\ncouldn't help thinking, he—he and Conrad together, of course—had done\nthem out of\n  <i>\n   any\n  </i>\n  kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,\nthough; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course was\ndestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the better\ncourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt inside\nhim. Strange—where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly have\ndeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then we've wasted all this time,\" Ninian sobbed, \"all this energy, all\nthis money, for nothing!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But you were nothing to begin with,\" Martin told them. And then,\nafter a pause, he added, \"I only wish I could be sure there had been\nsome purpose to this.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,\nor whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growing\nshadowy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you be\nwiped out of existence,\" he went on voicing his thoughts. \"But I know\nthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world will\nhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It's\nbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he told\nhimself. Two men, that was—one real, one a shadow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he said, \"there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitter\nworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once—just this\nonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And—\" he\npressed Martin's hand—\"believe me, what I did—what\n  <i>\n   we\n  </i>\n  did, you and\nI—serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everything\nis going to be all right.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Was Conrad\n  <i>\n   actually\n  </i>\n  different from the rest?\n </p>\n <p>\n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny—that I am a criminal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future—other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n </p>\n\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "109", "uid": "3561073fc40741b88473fc08e7d90fc1", "response_text": "This story follows the life of Martin from a young boy living in a rough neighborhood to an old man dying aboard an unmanned ship. We first see Martin following the disappearance of his mother - and lack of a father - which are commonplace in the neighborhood he grows up in where the kids rarely attend school and their living conditions are poor. Martin is taken in by a young woman, Ninian, who instructs him to call her Aunt Ninian despite being identified as his future descendant. Ninian has traveled back in time to her great-great-grandfather - Martin - in order to protect him from his future son Conrad. Conrad, described as an idealist, is dismayed by the future generations exploitation of Earth and destructive social order that casts out anyone and everything that doesn't encompass the privileged and elite. To correct the wrongdoings of the future, Conrad plans to kill Martin. The rest of Conrad’s cousins intercept this plan and instead, all decide to travel into the past to accompany Martin and protect him from an assassination attempt. \n\nMartin’s formative years are accompanied by Ninian, Raymond and Ives where he picks up art as a career, forms impersonal relationships with his descendants and learns more about the past and future quality of life. As years pass with no threat of Conrad in sight, Martin begins to explore his world alongside Ives on a yacht named The Interregnum. Soon though, the cousins that come and go begin to blur together and Martin picks up a detached view of the world as his interest wanes in his sheltered life. Martin lives to a very old age, and on his deathbed aboard the yacht, he is surrounded by all his descendants besides Ives, who passed of sickness earlier before. It is at this moment that Conrad appears, seemingly to finish his murder plot. However, it is revealed that no action was required to be taken by Conrad, as his fellow cousins have already achieved the mission of erasing their lineage. By containing Martin to a sheltered life, the cousins prevented Martin from living his normal life with a wife and kids, thus removing the possibility of their existence in the past, present and future. Furthermore, it is revealed that Martin had come to the same conclusion years ago, and chose instead to keep quiet out of his disdain for his descendants. With the cousins horrified at the knowledge, Conrad reassures Martin that their inaction resulted in hope, and Martin ponders to wonder if the assurance was genuine as he peacefully dies alone on the boat. \n"}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "0784e4f29ffd49f8a1a30aa6951e2062", "response_text": "Martin’s mother disappears, but nobody is surprised because mothers usually disappear around these parts.

His living conditions have improved, but Martin misses his old neighborhood where he could play with the other children. Ninian and her relatives only take care of him as if it is some unpleasant duty; he learns that nobody works with hands anymore in their world because it is all done by machinery. When Martin turns sixteen, Raymond tells him about Conrad and his idealist ideas of making living fairer for the exploited natives on other planets. Conrad blames his great-grandfather for discovering the super drive. Conrad then bribes one of Professor Farka’s assistants to reveal information about a time transmitter, and he plans to go back in time to eliminate the common ancestor. Raymond explains that they got plans from another assistant and a handicrafts enthusiast to build another gadget. They could guard over Martin day and night so Conrad could not attack. Raymond explains that Ninian is leaving, and Martin feels oddly desolate because of their time together. When she leaves, Ninian cries at her inadequacy; Martin and Raymond move to a luxurious mansion in a remote area that protects them from the Second Atomic War. The relatives come back to hold meetings; Martin thinks he wants to be a physicist or engineer, but the relatives insist that he should be a painter. Ives eventually takes over and displays his art in a museum, and he buys a yacht called The Interregnum to go traveling. He lives out the rest of his days on the yacht with the other descendants, but he does not care for them much. Ives explains that the future world is not that much better, and he isn’t even sure if Conrad is wrong. Ives, however, ends up dying from a chill. Eventually, Martin’s work is bought by a museum in Italy; he asks one cousin where Conrad is. He lies dying at one hundred and four as the relatives all come to visit. Conrad comes to visit too, and he explains to the other cousins that they will all disappear because Martin was never allowed to lead a normal life. After realizing that the other man knew all along, Raymond calls Martin a criminal, but Martin does not mind. Conrad tells him that their plan will benefit the future, but Martin is not sure if he is telling the truth or not. As Martin dies, he is the only one left on the ship because everybody else has disappeared.

More and more descendants of Martin come to his time in order to take care of him, taking turns of about 5 years in doing so, and are referred to as cousins. One of the cousins also reveals that the reason that they are protecting him is because one of their cousins wants to kill him. This is because one of Martin’s descendants created a piece of equipment that allowed humans to travel through space, leading to humans taking advantage of native species of other planets for their own economic benefit. Conrad, the descendant who wanted to kill him, wants to stop humans from ever traveling through space. Martin continues this boring life, preparing for the eventual arrival of Conrad who wants to kill him. Throughout his boring and repetitive life, Martin begins to question the actions of his descendants. When eventually Martin is an old man and is going to die, all of his descendants get together to say goodbye. This is where Conrad finally made an appearance, and it is revealed that everything was part of Conrad’s plan, as living his repetitive life Martin never had the chance to have children, therefore stopping his descendant from inventing the equipment necessary for human space travel.

At the beginning, he lives in a poor neighborhood with his mother, who disappears one day. Instead, he is now looked after by Ninian, who claims to be Martin’s descendant from the future who came here to protect him from Conrad - Ninian’s cousin. She hires private tutors for him and soon decides to move to a better neighborhood and live in a big well-furnished house. Occasionally, the other descendants, like Ives or Raymond, also visit them and talk about the future where almost nobody works, and everything is done by machinery. Martin turns sixteen when Raymond finally tells him the full story: Raymond's brother Conrad was disappointed by the fact that the humans of his time exploited the other life forms on the other planets to get food and resources. He decided to eliminate their common ancestor - Martin -  so that no space travel inventions would have existed. The others - cousins as he should call them - went back in time to save him and, consequently, save themselves. Martin also learns about the security system and the collection of weaponry they have to protect him. Soon Ninian leaves, and Martin, together with Raymond, moves into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. They talk about Martin’s future occupation. Though he prefers engineering or physics, they choose art to avoid any accidental premature inventions he can create since he is already familiar with the science of the future. Martin becomes a second-rate artist, and his new guardian - Ives - arrives. He decides to buy a yacht - The Interregnum - and see the rest of the world with Martin. Martin doesn’t develop any special feelings for his ancestors, except for Ives. Martin learns more about the future from him: only an enclave of a couple of million people left on Earth, and representatives of the lower classes got deported to the other planets and are being exploited; several worlds have already been made inhabitable. Ives admits that his brother is not completely wrong, but he still cannot let him destroy his life. \n\nOne winter, Ives rapidly dies from a severe chill in Tierra del Fuego after they stopped there for a bit. Years go by, and Martin loses any interest in life, sometimes painting the sea view from the yacht. They stop in Italy, and he sells two paintings. Wars force them to go to different hemispheres and the Arctic. Eventually, Martin turns a hundred and four when his last illness comes. Finally, Conrad appears. He shocks all the gathered ancestors by explaining that the sheltered life they had created for Martin didn’t allow him to live his own life, or at least, have kids. When he dies, everyone will disappear, too. Martin figured it out years ago. Conrad assures him that his deed leads to a better future because he has been there. Erasing the future all his ancestors came from, Martin peacefully dies on the yacht, which drifts for years about the seas.

She seemed to\nbe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\nthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\nthrough her hallways.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\na big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\nhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\nreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\nwere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\ncontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\nmoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\nneed a shave.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\nhand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He turned to the port to stare out at the planet. The Sol-type sun\nmust be rising, since there was a dim light. But the thick clouds that\nwrapped the entire world diffused its rays into a haze. For a change,\nit wasn't raining, though the ground was covered by thick swirls of\nfog. In the distance, the tops of shrubs that made a scrub forest\nglowed yellow-green. Motions around them suggested a herd of feeding\nanimals. Details were impossible to see through the haze. Even the\ndeep gorge where they'd found Hennessy's carefully buried ship was\ncompletely hidden by the fog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There were three of the blobs dancing about over the grazing animals\nnow, as they often seemed to do. Gwayne stared at them for a minute,\ntrying to read sense into the things. If he had time to study them....\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there was no time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Earth had ordered him to detour here, after leaving his load of\ndeep-sleep stored colonists on Official World 71, to check on any sign\nof Hennessy. He'd been here a week longer than he should have stayed\nalready. If there was no sign in another day or so of what had happened\nto the men who'd deserted their ship and its equipment, he'd have to\nreport back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He would have left before, if a recent landslip hadn't exposed enough\nof the buried ship for his metal locators to spot from the air by\nluck. It had obviously been hidden deep enough to foil the detectors\noriginally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bob!\" Jane Corey's voice cut through his pondering. \"Bob, there are\nthe kids!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before he could swing to follow her pointing finger, movement caught\nhis eye.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The blobs had left the herd. Now the three were streaking at fantastic\nspeed to a spot near the ship, to hover excitedly above something that\nmoved there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He saw the two cadets then, heading back to the waiting ship, just\nbeyond the movement he'd seen through the mist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whatever was making the fog swirl must have reached higher ground.\nSomething began to heave upwards. It was too far to see clearly, but\nGwayne grabbed the microphone, yelling into the radio toward the cadets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They must have seen whatever it was just as the call reached them.\nYoung Kaufman grabbed at Pinelli, and they swung around together.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then the mists cleared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under the dancing blobs, a horde of things was heading for the cadets.\nShaggy heads, brute bodies vaguely man-like! One seemed to be almost\neight feet tall, leading the others directly toward the spacesuited\ncadets. Some of the horde were carrying spears or sticks. There was a\nmomentary halt, and then the leader lifted one arm, as if motioning the\nothers forward.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Get the jeeps out!\" Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door of\nthe little officers' lift open and jabbed the down button. It was\nagonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door\nback at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in\nconfusion. But someone was taking over now—one of the crew women. The\njeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and\nGwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was\nirritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to\nthe seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the\njeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked\nup speed. The other two followed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;\nsurrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked\nhorrible in a travesty of manhood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were\nracing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung\nabout, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty\nmiles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in\nspite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived\ndownward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool to\nleave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the\nkids. But it was too late to go back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into\na gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he\nhad to slow as the fog thickened lower down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own\ntrail to confuse the pursuers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a\nglimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse\nfaces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the\nwindshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the\nsteering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The\nother jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late\nto help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or\nthe horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature\nseemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward\nagainst the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot\nleader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on each\nshoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creature\nleaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, diving\nfor the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The arms were thin and grotesque below the massively distorted\nshoulders, but amazingly strong. Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his\nhands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his\nnose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after\nthe captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy\nsound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no\nfurther move, though it was still breathing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli\nwas either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to\nkick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded\nonto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster\non another before heading back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook\nhis own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live—and you're\ndetailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign\nlanguage or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy\nand why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the\nanswer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barker nodded grimly. \"I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alien\nmetabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spat\nsickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still\nmakes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was\nno sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get\nanything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstaying\nour time here already.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd been\npicked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were\nbusy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon\nas he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less\ninformative with retelling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save\ntime and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. That\nwas almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed\nto be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group had\nbeen overcome by the aliens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the\nprimitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was its\nfuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told\nthese creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by a\nlittle more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the ship\ncunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find\nsomething—and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could make\nremotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons\ninto a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to\nprevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found\na drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent life\nthere to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had\nfinally proved that the sun was going to go nova.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go—but it would\nrender the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,\nman had to colonize.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The\nexplorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the\nterraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships\nbegan filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve\nspace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and\nfour more months back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the\nfootholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe some\nof the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe none\nwould be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each was\nprecious as a haven for the race.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, as\nit now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to\nstrip them of their world, but the first law was survival.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But how could primitives do what these must have done?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of\ncemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully\nlaminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human\nhand had been able to do for centuries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can\nsee a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were\nsquatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.\nThey were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?\nFor the return of their leader—or for something that would give the\nship to them?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How's the captive coming?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Barker's voice sounded odd.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Physically fine. You can see him. But—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore\nat Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not\nchecking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling\nsound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker\nseemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The\nthick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make\nsome kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up\nunerringly toward the device on the officer's cap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\"\nBarker said. There was a grin on the doctor's lips, but his face was\ntaut with strain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on\nits head. It was the golden comet of a captain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He never meant to hurt the kids—just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\nquickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed. He can't talk very\nwell. Says they've had to change the language around to make the sounds\nfit, and he's forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it\ngets easier as you listen. It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\non the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\nEnglish, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\nkid's dog have? How many were brown?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the\ncuriously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment\nspread out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three. Seven. Zero.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The answers were right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the\ntwisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a\nlong time telling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in\nsilence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it\npossible, Doc?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not\nby what I know. But it happened. I've looked at a few tissues under\nthe microscope. The changes are there. It's hard to believe about\ntheir kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can't be\na hereditary change—the things that affect the body don't change the\ngerm plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe\nthe fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped\ndown to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of\nmonsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as\ntall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The kids of the exploring party....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Back in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers,\nset the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgle\nas the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto the\nground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to the\nship again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd had\ntime to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,\nhowever much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting off\ngiving the gist of it to Jane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was the blobs,\" he summarized it. \"They seem to be amused by men.\nThey don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessy\ndoesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,\nall life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside the\nhull. It doesn't show yet—but we're changed. In another month, Earth\nfood would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeper\nthis time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colony\nwhere three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll never\nknow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nobody would know. Their children—odd children who matured in eight\nyears—would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earth\ntools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.\nNothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the new\neyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what must\nnow be her home. Then she sighed. \"You'll need practice, but the others\ndon't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'll\nbelieve it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really been\nchanged yet, have we?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. \"No.\nThey have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was only\npuzzlement in her face. \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her the\nsame answer he had found for himself. \"The spawning ground!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant her\nseed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preserve\nthat seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already were\nbecoming uncertain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead of\nmen having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strange\nchildren of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek back\nto civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhaps\nsome of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the next\nrise to culture a better one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We're needed here,\" he told her, his voice pleading for the\nunderstanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. \"These people need\nas rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.\nThe fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them with\na decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe or\naccept the idea—or even let us come back. We have to stay here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. \"Be\nfruitful,\" she whispered. \"Be fruitful and spawn and replenish an\nearth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" he told her. \"Replenish the stars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanes\nagain, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, they\ncould adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead them\nthrough all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyond\nnumbering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for the\nchildren of men!\n </p>\n \n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "112", "uid": "433c25c82cc749389b26ea9f22686d22", "response_text": "The Starship Pandora lands on a planet where an exploring ship and a rescue group disappear.

As the cadets are heading back to Gwayne’s ship, a herd of blobs disperses in excitement and instead they begin to hover over a singular spot. The cadets turn to find a horde of things heading towards them, described to be vaguely man-like with a distinct leader at eight feet tall, and all of them holding objects like spears or sticks. In a race to reach the cadets before the things did, Gwayne, Jane and other officers raced in Jeeps towards the boys. Noticing the incoming Jeeps, the creatures grabbed the boys and disappeared into the mists, with the officers following fast in pursuit.

In the end, we find out that Gwayne and Jane consider the answer to finding a new planet to be void, as they only thing they could do is find a new spawning ground, which they would be able to achieve if both crews spawn a new race on this planet and eventually, explore the star lanes once again. \n"}, {"worker_id": "111", "uid": "2e7ac0d328af449aaf0169a3bb6ddd4e", "response_text": "The story is about a ship captain, Gwayne, and his team arriving on a new planet.

After this realization, she smiles and understands this reality to be fruitful and eventually, spawn to replenish Earth. \n"}, {"worker_id": "111", "uid": "2e7ac0d328af449aaf0169a3bb6ddd4e", "response_text": "Jane Corey is a lieutenant in Captain Gwayne’s ship.

KASTLE\n </h2>\n <h3>\n  Illustrated by von Dongen\n </h3>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be\nwelcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a\nhero...?\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual\nspeeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had\nonce been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had\nsince engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything\nwasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as\nat-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming—for Corporal Berringer,\none of the crew of the spaceship\n  <i>\n   Washington\n  </i>\n  , first to set Americans\nupon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His\nHonor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the\nhometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal\ntour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat\nbetween the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,\nand looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National\nGuard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of\nthe churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their\nparishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous\nnational interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them\ncome around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as\nthey'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these—as the\nnewspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century—the\nGalloping Twenties.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man\nand he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than\nany man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a\nkiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old\nfriends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.\nHe wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps\nhe would talk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had\nreturned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great\nmariners, from Columbus onward—long, dull periods of time passing,\npassing, and then the arrival.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him\noff at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.\nThey had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,\nalmost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had\nwanted it to be as before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had\nescorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.\nHe was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with\nstrangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing\nbeside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,\ntheir eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was\nstill too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate\nflagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental\nknocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was\nsurprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching\nat a window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And perhaps she\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she\nhadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved\nin high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.\nRalphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual\nsupport, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They\nlooked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,\n\"It's good to be home!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other\narm around him. He kissed her—her neck, her cheek—and all the old\njokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the\nand-\n  <i>\n   then\n  </i>\n  -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.\nShe was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the\ndifference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to\nRalphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could\nthink of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the\nfloor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I\ndidn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that\neverything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General\nCarlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left\nWashington.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need\nthe time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,\na cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat\ndown beside him—but she had hesitated. He\n  <i>\n   wasn't\n  </i>\n  being sensitive; she\nhad hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De\nGama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon—but more\nso. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked\nwith him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic\njourney—even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius\nin uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   The eyes. It always showed in their eyes.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy\nalready tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of\nfeature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself\ntwenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a\nway that few ten-year-old faces are.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How's it going in school?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Pretty good.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and\nhe made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the\nwarmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as\nhe left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had\nfeared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in\ncontinent-to-continent experimental flight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.\nBut now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the\nlong journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt\nand the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's\nHarmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,\nhe waved his hand—it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook—and\nran from the room and from the house.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in\nhis arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very\ntired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd\nbeen lying down all the months of the way back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and\nmake small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do—make small talk\nand pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;\nthey wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past\nthe small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was\nnewly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an\nornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more\nominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire\nfence around the experimental station.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the\nfresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you\nto get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.\nYou always said it reminded you—being able to see the sky—that you\nwere going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it\nto this bed again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom\nset and I really didn't know—\" She waved her hand, her face white.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was sure then that she\n  <i>\n   had\n  </i>\n  known, and that the beds and the barrier\nbetween them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went\nto the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,\nbegan to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars\nstill showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite\nwall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the\nscars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing\ndiagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.\nThere were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd\nbeen treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen\nthem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would\nkeep them from her until they were gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter\nReed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found\ndistasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,\nhe began to understand that there would be many things, previously\nbeneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;\nRalphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably\nchanged—because they thought\n  <i>\n   he\n  </i>\n  had changed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let\nhimself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known\nbefore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began\nfiltering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same\nman who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and\nfriends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could\ncommunicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One\nwould again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for—a\nreturn to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash\ninstead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be\ngranted to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He slept.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Dinner was at seven\n  p.m.\n  His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille\ncame. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate\nin the dining room at the big table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His\nfamily had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of\ntalkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes—especially with\ncompany present—to describe everything and anything that had happened\nto him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially\nwith his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been\ngood-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\"\nwas perhaps the word.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,\nefficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked\nat Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,\n\"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times\nbefore, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip\nsomething like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time\nshe burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was\nthe fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort\nher; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched\nher left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move\nit—she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool\nembrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it\ndrop out of sight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,\nthe hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe\nbegan to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform\nhouses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.\n\"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before—\" At that point he\nlooked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in\nthis normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,\nmumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a\nlittle; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday\nGarden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between\nJoe and Mother—his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt\nalone—and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose\nbushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or\ntrowel.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that—a pitiful twitching of\nthe lips—and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,\nand then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I\nhave a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a\nwhile.\" She touched his shoulder in passing—his affectionate, effusive\nmother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often\nirritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses—she barely\ntouched his shoulder and fled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served—thin, rare\nslices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He\ncut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie\nand said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"\nRalphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and\nmurmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said\nLucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going\ninto the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of\ncourse,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at\nRalphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was\nchewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at\nLucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass\noverturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They\nwere all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big\nright fist—Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a\nscene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the\nFirst One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear\nof, that he could have smashed more than a table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edith said, \"Hank!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of\nthe lot of you.\"\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food\ndown his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear—\" He didn't answer. She began\nto cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said\nanything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been\nthe time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about\ngetting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"\nand he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special\ndessert she'd been preparing half the day—a magnificent English trifle.\nShe served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She\nhesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the\nboy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the\ntable. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,\n\"Hey, I promised—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or\nsomething; anything to get away from your father.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening\ntogether—talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I\nwant to. The question is whether\n  <i>\n   you\n  </i>\n  want to.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their\neyes—his wife's and son's eyes—could not meet his, and so he said he\nwas going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in\nall probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that\nthey shouldn't count on him for normal social life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a\nlighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,\nand it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I\ncould barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want\nto go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful\ntimes together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and\nclosest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down!\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd\nalso expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to\nexpect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded\nvery much the way he always had—soft spoken and full of laughter and\nfull of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and\nclapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had—so much\nmore gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was\ngood for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along\non the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to\nManfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee\nand Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he\nmerely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there\nmany times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized\nhim. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as\nif he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he\nsaid, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his\nmind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her\nface—pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual\nof flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going\nto be sick.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.\nAnd through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,\nmechanical dancing doll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,\n\"Beddy-bye time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited\nfor her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.\nBecause while she put herself against him, there was something in her\nface—no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes—that made him know\nshe was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when\nthe music ended, he was ready to go home.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of\nPhil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,\nPhil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old\nself. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with\nthe First One.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and\nPhil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and\nlooked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence\nparalleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's\nthe most popular place on earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a\nlittle sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a\nwhile longer, not yet aware of his supposed\n  <i>\n   faux pas\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter\nrumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Phil said, \"Because people are—\" And then he caught himself and waved\nhis hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the\nwindow, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting\ntombstones.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been\nnothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should\nlet me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home—or that's what everyone\nseems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that\nwould satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or\nanother monster from the movies.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four\nblocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He\ndidn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path\nand entered the house.\n </p>\n <hr style=\"width: 45%;\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll\nall work out in time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a\nlittle time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.\nI should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt\nyou terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're\nfrightened.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as\nnecessary. For good if need be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since\nreturning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,\neven as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right\nnow. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I\ndid—seven months ago next Wednesday—he's going to be next. He was\nsmashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost\nready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save\nall they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man\nloses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,\nhe'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and\norgan process—the process that made it all possible. So people have to\nget used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old\nsuperstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of\nus; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please\nbelieve that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and—\" She paused.\n\"There's one question.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by\neveryone from the president of the United States on down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half\nmonths—slept without dreaming.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was\nsatisfied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of\nhow they announced death and the presence of monsters.

Svan was the leader making the final\n  <br/>\n  plans—plotting them a bit too well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n  <br/>\n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n  <br/>\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  <br/>\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The Officer of the Deck was pleased as he returned to the main lock.\nThere was no reason why everything shouldn't have been functioning\nperfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the\nsame. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\nlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\nturned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The OD nodded. \"I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said.\n\"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\nready to lift as soon as they come back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \"\n  <i>\n   If\n  </i>\n  they come back.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is there any question?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Exec shrugged. \"I don't know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny\nplace. I don't trust the natives.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they're human beings,\njust like us—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't\neven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don't like them.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate\nthemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\noutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\nVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\nwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\nguards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there's a minority who are afraid\nof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\nThey think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\nknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground\ngroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\nnative Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that\nis—right down into the mud. Well—\" he laughed—\"maybe they will.\nAfter all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic\nvoice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments\nreports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\nstared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\nenough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He\nsnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\n\"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But\neven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\nand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"You see?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\nothers in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\ntheir own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n  <i>\n   They\n  </i>\n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized—murder?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial—\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger—\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n </p>\n <p>\n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it—a second, ten seconds....\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n  <i>\n   A traitor!\n  </i>\n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n  <i>\n   A coward!\n  </i>\n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The six conspirators in Svan's old ground car moved slowly along the\nmain street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except\nfor deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the\nentrance to the town's Hall of Justice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good,\" said Svan, observing them. \"The delegation is still here. We\nhave ample time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching\nthe faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.\nIngra? Her aunt? One of the men?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The right answer leaped up at him.\n  <i>\n   They all are\n  </i>\n  , he thought.\n  <i>\n   Not one\nof them understands what this means. They're afraid.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  He clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was\ndriving. \"Let's get this done with.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her\neyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy\ncar jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite\ndark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,\nilluminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the\njungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The\npresent shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off\nagain, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence\nthat followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: \"Halt!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the\nbrakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them\nfrom the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are you going?\" he growled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened\nthe door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard\nit was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is\nthat not permitted?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The\norder was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It\nis urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a\ncomplicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Confusion furrowed the guard's hairless brows, then was replaced by\na sudden flare of understanding—and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared.\n\"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—\"\nHe strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was\nfaster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.\nHe hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against\nthe splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan\nsavagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like\nnails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength\nin his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial\nadvantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard\nlay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had\nruthlessly pounded it against the road.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the\npetrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,\nthen reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over\nthe shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the\njungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be\nno trace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now\nthere is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep\na watch for other guards.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Venus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.\nEnsign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow\nof the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can't see a thing,\" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away\nat the computer's table. \"Look—are those lights over there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. \"Probably the guards. Of\ncourse, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no\nanswer in his stolid face. \"Don't joke about it,\" he said. \"Suppose\nsomething happens to the delegation?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then we're in the soup,\" the Exec said philosophically. \"I told you\nthe natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They've been prohibited for the\nlast three hundred years.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It isn't all the natives,\" Lowry said. \"Look how they've doubled the\nguard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they\nknow how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's this\nsecret group they call the Council.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it?\" the\nExec retorted. \"They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's gone\nout now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to be\ncoming from the town, anyhow....\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the\nlights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment\nunder the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get\nthe atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.\nCertainly it did not occur to them that there had been\n  <i>\n   two\n  </i>\n  bombs in\nthe compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got out of the car, holding the sphere. \"This will do for me,\" he\nsaid. \"They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we\nwere wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. \"We must circle back\nagain,\" she parroted. \"We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car\ninto the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan, listening, thought:\n  <i>\n   It's not much of a plan. The guards would\nnot be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. If\nthey must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a\npurpose.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Aloud, he said, \"You understand. If I get through, I will return to the\ncity on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because\nthe bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,\nyou are in no danger from the guards.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   From the guards\n  </i>\n  , his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would\nfeel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in\nthat bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a\nground-shaking crash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting\noff the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached\nfor him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of\nthe car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,\nsent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few\nhundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?\nWas it an error that the girl should die with the others?\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was\ndriven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And\nsince he could not know which was the one who had received the marked\nslip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the\njungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed\nlights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by\nits own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circling\nfigures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own.\nThey would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those\nslim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the\nside of the ship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.\nHe had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went\nabsently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He\nturned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first\ncross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car\nwas racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare\nof its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Paralyzed, he heard the girl's voice. \"Svan! They're coming! They found\nthe guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,\nwith those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came\nfor you. We must flee!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared unseeingly at the light. \"Go away!\" he croaked unbelievingly.\nThen his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb\nin the car—\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and\nswinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before\nsomething immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted\nfrom the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force\nonto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the\nsound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to\nfeel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He's still alive,\" he said\ncallously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won't last long, though.\nWhat've you got there?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two\nhalves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a\nconnection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type,\ndelayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,\nand it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won't do any bombing\nnow.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.\nThe surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It's poetic justice if I ever saw it.\nThey had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of\npaper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don't get,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on\nit? What about it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had\nthe devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over\nslowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be\ndoing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\"\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "112", "uid": "57f8b65bd11d491dbf6c73685c2779d6", "response_text": "Svan, a leader of members in the Council on Venus, plots to revolt against the Earthman delegations who are going to bring back the news of the habitability of Venus. Initially, he eavesdrops on the conversation between the Office of the Deck and the Executive Officer, which is about the untrustworthiness of Venusians, the descendants of the first generation of Earthman who migrated to Venus. Svan then initiates a revolting plan against the Earthman.\n\nBy showing this conversation to the group, Svan convinces the members to conduct his plan of not letting the Earthman ship go back to the Earth. In his plan, they will drive near the ship, five people will cause some chaos to attract the guards, and one person will put the delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship. They draw lots to determine when they decide who will put the bomb. However, Svan finds that no one admits to being the one, so he draws a cross on his slip, pretending to be the one who has terrible luck. \n\nAfter assigning the tasks to each person, Svan and his members drive to cross the border, where Svan brings down a native guard. When they separate to let one group cause the commotion and let Svan put the bomb, Svan takes out one bomb and leaves another one in the car. He knows that the bomb on the car will explode and attract the Earthman guards, which is unknown by the other members. He sees the car leave and turns to wait for the explosion.

When the humans arrive, a group of natives called “The Council” decided to bomb the ship of the humans. To decide the person who would sneak on the ship to plant the bomb, the natives marked a slip with an X and randomly picked slips. When no one came forward, the leader of the natives, Svan, decided to do it himself. Because the person with the X didn’t come forward, Svan didn’t trust his group anymore. Therefore, after the group sneaked past a guard, Svan decided to blow up both the car with his team and the ship. Svan and his team split up, and just as the car’s bomb was going to explode, they returned to Svan because they were caught. This led to all of them getting blown up.

A delegation from Earth just arrived on Venus, and everyone wonders what is going to happen next now that people know Venus is habitable. \n\nThe Executive Officer - the Exec - and the Officer of the Deck - Lowry -  talk in the Earth-ship’s open lock. The Exec doubts the natives’ friendliness and does not consider them human anymore. Lowry tries to explain that their appearance doesn't affect their amiability. He also tells the Exec that some natives are afraid of the possible wave of immigration from Earth because it can ruin their regular way of life, and some underground group is spreading the word that the consequences will be even worse. Lowry adds that it’s possible but is interrupted by a loud voice notifying them about a spy ray focused on their lock.

So Svan quickly marks his slip and pretends to be the one who was initially chosen. He explains the specifics of their plan: while he will be near the ship, the others will fake a car accident to draw some guards which will allow Svan to get in. Their car is stopped by the State Guard who realizes that Svan is the reason the state of danger was declared. Svan kills the guard and hides the body. He takes one bomb and leaves another one in the car, hoping that the explosion will draw enough attention and punish the five people he now considers fearful traitors. Before the car takes off, Ingra kisses Svan. He waits near the ship fumbling with his slip and wondering who the coward was. Suddenly, he hears the car is driving back. Ingra screams that they were chased, but got away and came back for Svan. He starts running from the car, realizing the bomb inside it is supposed to detonate. The explosion wave knocks him out.

The Officer of the Deck on the Earth spaceship reports to The Executive Officer about a pathetic underground group of dissidents who spread the rumor that immigrants will kill the indigenous Venusians, descendants of the first expedition. During their arrogant conversation, the ship receives news of an attempted attack.\n\tAn underground organization controlled by an indigenous Venusian, Svan, overhears the ship's delegation's conversation about their contemptuous attitude towards the natives. Svan is determined not to let the Earth colonizers leave Venus and destroy the ship before its departure. The council informs the Venusians that only they had the right to decide the course of action. The underground organization agrees that if the Earth ship returned, it would mean disaster for Venus. Therefore, it should not return. Svan plans to sneak aboard at night and attach the Atomit magnetic time bomb to the ship. However, the commander faces the problem of betrayal, indecision, and cowardice among his renegade team. Svan suggests that the operation draws lots to decide who will be honored to perform the most critical part of the plan - the attachment of the bomb. He draws a small cross on one of the random papers in the bowl for the draw. After distributing the pieces of paper, Svan realizes that none of the team members agrees to reveal the brave one, fulfilling his duty to the people of Venus. The current political situation scares the six conspirators to attempt their expedition. After a fight with the guard, Svan and his team successfully make their way to the ship, but a second bomb turns out to be in Svan's possession and put into the car of his subordinates. Not only does Svan plan to explode the colonizers' ship, but also to take out revenge on his crew. As soon as he thinks of killing two birds with one stone: the Earth colonizers and five traitors, one of the team members Ingra, kisses Svan before going on board and wishes him good luck. Svan is thrown into a shudder, realizing that he is making a fatal mistake. As a result of his confusion, both bombs explode: in his pocket and the car of his accomplices. \nDying on the table of an Earth surgeon on the ship he was trying to destroy, Svan overhears a conversation between the Watch assistant Lowry and the doctor.

It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n  <i>\n   C. P. Sale\n  </i>\n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife\nin space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher\nextraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,\nguardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.\nGenerally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim\nis the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties\nof his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann\nwas the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do\nso alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have\ndone splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart\nwas a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet\nEarth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as\nWilly Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a\nPullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social\nhemorrhoid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.\nIt was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey,\nRobert,\" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate\nshipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed\n  <i>\n   haut\ncuisine\n  </i>\n  and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our\nalgaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was\nCaptain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any\nother name than The Kitchen Cabinet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste\nof synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by\nChlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano\nand thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,\ntextured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the\nslabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.\nFor dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of\nthe carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,\n\"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun\nin my home country:\n  <i>\n   Mensch ist was er isst.\n  </i>\n  It means, you are what\nyou eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this\n  <i>\n   Schweinerei\n  </i>\n  you are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin\nwith his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the\nladder from the dining-cubby.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can\ngive his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got\nto live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I\nsaid. \"He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in\nmy time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It\nwas green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This\nis what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into\nits bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,\nwe'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous\ndeath of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up\nthe good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye\nfrom Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook\nwaved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I'm thinking about\ntomorrow's menu.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the\nnext day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed\nwith something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of\nburnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only\nguess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and\ndrying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine\nheads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The\n  <i>\n   pièce de\nrésistance\n  </i>\n  was again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal\nmass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only\nfaintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had\nbeen sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It's\nso tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it's really\nsteak.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently\nimploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big\nman's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me\nthis pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and\ncycler-salt.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,\" I said. I\ngazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, I eat it,\" the Captain said, taking and talking through another\nbite. \"But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and\ngrasshoppers, to stay alive.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?\" Bailey pleaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Only good food,\" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised\nalgae. He tapped his head with a finger. \"This—the brain that guides\nthe ship—cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,\nBelly-Robber?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. \"Yes, sir. But I really\ndon't know what I can do to please you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban\n  <i>\n   Hausfrau\n  </i>\n  with the\nvapors,\" Winkelmann said. \"I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums\nor weeping. Only—can you understand this, so simple?—food that will\nkeep my belly content and my brain alive.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, sir,\" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British\nterm Dumb Insolence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I\nfollowed him. \"Captain,\" I said, \"you're driving Bailey too hard.\nYou're asking him to make bricks without straw.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. \"You think, Doctor,\nthat my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged\nman?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,\"\nWinkelmann said. \"Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the\nPharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of\nIsrael would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the\nmother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him\nuncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,\nto improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn\nsomehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You're driving him too hard, Sir,\" I said. \"He'll crack.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we\nground at Brady Station,\" Captain Winkelmann said. \"So much money buys\nmany discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Crew morale on the ship....\" I began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,\" Captain Winkelmann repeated.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical\npath to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate\nthe appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned\nby that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at\nmealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. \"Convey my\ncompliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of\nthe crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would\ncheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius\nacidly called in question again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go\ninto Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in\nbrilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an\n  <i>\n   ersatz\n  </i>\n  hot\nturkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella\nturkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy\na grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae\na lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a\ngenuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second\nhelping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but\nonly arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require\na geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere\nedibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will\nhave learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics\nstudent. That will be all, Bailey.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of\nBailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their\nCaptain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark\non an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last\nfew days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many\nmemories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had\nlost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,\nseemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,\nand he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our\nCaptain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice\nthat would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when\nWinkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Each man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects\nbesides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As\nhis rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this\nration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of\nbooks, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help\nhim while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a\nfact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of\nspices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,\nand a dozen others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards\ninterested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien\nto his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd\nexercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance\nto the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.\nTo collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come\naboard their ship mother-naked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects\nbaggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon\nmess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet\non the mysterious box as he sat to eat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today,\nBelly-Robber?\" he asked the Cook.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd\nhad much practice. \"I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,\"\nhe said. \"I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the\ntexture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand,\" Winkelmann growled. \"You intend that your latest mess\nshould feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Sir,\" Bailey said. \"Well, I squeezed the\nsteak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special\nseasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal\noil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out.\n  <i>\n   Voila!\n  </i>\n  I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine\nmeat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Remarkable, Bailey,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with\nour food,\" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of\ndistaste. \"It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I\nnever cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils\nthe meal.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of\nthe table and tenderly lifted a small \"steak\" onto each of our plates.\n\"Try it,\" he urged the Captain.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The\ncolor was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell\nof fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. \"Not\ntoo bad, Belly-Robber,\" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed\nhis head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A\nkind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a\nmore reasonable man. \"But it still needs something ... something,\"\nWinkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.\n\"Aha! I have it!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, Sir?\" Bailey asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This, Belly-Robber!\" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and\nripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed\nthe cap. \"Ketchup,\" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's\nmasterpiece. \"The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.\"\nLifting a hunk of the \"steak,\" streaming ketchup, to his mouth,\nWinkelmann chewed. \"Just the thing,\" he smiled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn you!\" Bailey shouted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"... Sir,\" Bailey added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said\nmeditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have\nsufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a\nbottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But, Sir....\" Bailey began.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat\nto the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic\nslops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of\nthis sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in\nno condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you\nunderstand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,\nslave-driving....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are\ninsubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Captain, you've gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was\nscarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's\nSurgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers\nand the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said.\n\"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him\nto my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my\nbunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal\nbulkhead. \"You'll have that drink now,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, dammit!\" he shouted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Orders,\" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. \"This is\ntherapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat\nlike water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. \"Sorry, Doc,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've taken more pressure than most men would,\" I said. \"Nothing to\nbe ashamed of.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel\nand sauerkraut and\n  <i>\n   Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art\n  </i>\n  out of an algae\ntank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out\nmolecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And\nhe expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet\nof the Friends of Escoffier!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,\" I said. \"You've worked your\nfingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not\nappreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year\nfrom now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that\nrestaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hate him,\" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He\nreached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be\nan apt confederate of\n  <i>\n   vis medicatrix naturae\n  </i>\n  , the healing power of\nnature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it\noff. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in\nhorribleness, a pottage or boiled\n  <i>\n   Chlorella vulgaris\n  </i>\n  that looked\nand tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,\nred-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as\nthough daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the\ndisgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, \"Belly-Robber, you're\nimproving a little at last.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey nodded and smiled. \"Thank you, Sir,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were\nnow strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of\nirony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was\na price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann\ntheory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain\nhad pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I\nthought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted\nof salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were\nvehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for\nthe decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served\nthe algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley\noblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  There being only three seats in the\n  <i>\n   Sale's\n  </i>\n  mess compartment, we ate\nour meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to\nsupper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell\nto make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,\nof cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss\nof canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the\nfirst-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric\nwarming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of\nus with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried\nChlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched\nin a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron\nskillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut\na bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are\nlimits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the\ngalley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\"\nI said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is\nactually\n  <i>\n   good\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but\nthis is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;\nyou couldn't have done it without him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\"\nBailey asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our\nCaptain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\nperformance out of his Ship's Cook.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\nHe persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\nof the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\nspearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll\nhave to admit that I do.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\nplate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "107", "uid": "6e0e3a9e14fa4a978efb59fd8789cef4", "response_text": "The story first begins discussing how food is a central topic for men on ships. The Marsmen are called Slimeheads, honoring in their title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that open the road to the wider space without by filling the spaces within. The Ship’s Cook is described to be the most vital man on a spacer because he is the one who turns offal into eatables. There are also instances described where the cooks have messed up and created disasters for fellow crew members, such as poisoning them. Paul Vilanova, the narrator, goes on to tell what happened on the Charles Partlow Sale. The ship is to take a low-energy route and carries various seeds of plantlife. There are the Registry minimum of six men and three officers aboard, including Paul the surgeon, Willy Winkelmann the captain, and Robert Bailey the cook. The cook is responsible for the livelihood of all the men on the ship, and the algae also helped feed the men in a way where they cannot afford the luxury of squeamishness. Although Paul is the surgeon, he rarely lifts a knife in space because his duties are more in line with serving as a morale officer and wailing-wall. Captain Winkelman is described to have a heart of helium ice and is extremely unpopular. Bailey is often his target, but he tries his best as the Ship Cook to feed everybody in a way that makes the algae somewhat appetizing. Paul admits that he does not like the Captain much, but he tells Bailey that his cooking is what keeps the captain retaining his plump figure. Bailey cooks them a luxurious meal the next day, but the captain only criticizes him. Bailey tries to ask what Captain Winkelman wants from him, and even Paul says that he is going to crack from being driven so hard. The Captain tells him that he is simply trying to widen Bailey’s horizons in terms of cooking. Bailey tries to avoid the Captain during meal time after, and Paul believes that he is the finest cook to go into the Hohmann orbit. Even though everybody is impressed by his dishes, Winkelmann still refuses to compliment him despite gaining weight from eating. When Bailey tries to convince the Captain of his food again, Winkelmann takes out a bottle of ketchup to eat with his meal. Bailey is furious, while Paul tries to cheer him up over some fifty cc’s of rye. After the therapeutic drinking, Bailey begins to cook awful looking and tasting dishes. Winkelman, ironically, tells Bailey that he is improving even though the other crew members complain. When Paul goes to visit Bailey again later, one of the crew members exclaims that the cook has managed to make the algae taste similar to real food. Paul tells him that this is the result of the Captain’s continuous pushing; he answers that he does like the Captain when Bailey asks him again.

The story chronicles the importance of food in space, in particular, the trials of the Ship’s Cook in making delectable food out of ship-offal, which all food is made out of. \n\nThe Ship’s Cook, Bailey, is introduced to us as someone who feeds his shipmates by groundside standards. He hides the synthetic and off-putting tastes of the algal repasts with spices like oregano and thyme, and uses his culinary techniques to shape and reuse the offals into mock-meats and other familiar meals. His fellow ship mates are satisfied with the tastes and creativeness of the meals - with none of them losing the typical weight aboard a ship and their Captain Winkelmann, actually, gaining more weight instead. Despite this, the Captain verbalizes his dissatisfaction and criticizes each meal. Every time Bailey ups the ante in the tastes or creativeness of a meal prepared, the Captain’s critique only increases further. The story’s narrator aids the Cook's support and reassures him of the delicious quality of the food he prepares, second to none of the narrator’s past ship experiences. As part of his role in crew morale, the narrator tries to reason with the Captain in driving Bailey too hard, but to no avail. \n\nAt his breaking point, Bailey prepares the ship and the Captain an exquisite steak meal, mimicking its real texture, only to be insulted by the Captain bringing out ketchup and declaring it palpable only with the condiment. Respectfully telling off the Captain, the narrator brings Bailey back to his bunkers and reaches for alcohol as a healing power of nature, again reassuring him and commending him for taking the pressure. The next morning, the crew is served a disgusting pottage of the algae and finally, Bailey receives the Captain’s approval. The narrator is proud, willing to take the bad meals for the rest of the trip in exchange for Bailey overcoming the Captain and gaining his psychic defenses. After a day, the crew mates are rewarded by Bailey’s newest concoction: a barbecued steak that is complimented to actually taste of food and be delicious. The narrator reveals that the Captain’s relentless critique was actually to improve Bailey’s culinary skills and for the good of the ship, and is rewarded with another piece of the artificial steak. \n"}, {"worker_id": "111", "uid": "9e84f433edf649bb8f47f4603a2523ab", "response_text": "The story is about the crew of a spaceship that is making their way to Mars. At the beginning, the main character, Paul Vilanova, relates the importance of food in these trips. He says that the cook in a ship has the power to either make a trip or break a trip. On this particular trip, the cook is Robert Bailey. He is very talented, but the captain of the trip believes that he isn't. Throughout the story, the Captain continuously berates Bailey for the lack of quality in his cooking, even though Paul and the rest of the ship are really impressed with the food. Bailey is forced to cook with algae, as it allows for long trips and gives men all the necessary nutrients that they need. When the Captain begins to put ketchup on Bailey’s delicacies, he takes this as the last straw and begins to lower the quality of the cooking severely. Lastly, Bailey gives a steak that seemed to be perfect, perfectly cooked and a perfect replica of a real steak. It is hinted that this steak is actually human meat, and that Bailey killed the Captain. \n"}, {"worker_id": "113", "uid": "da5a1e0da9b54f88aa10a0be0b49e115", "response_text": "The story talks about the future in which people are traveling between different planets. The ones that do that are called the spacers. They spend a lot of time in space, and, thus, need to eat a lot. The solution of this future is algae that feed the men and help keep the ship a sustainable system. The narrator of the story is Paul Vilanova, a spacer. Sometime in the past, he traveled to Mars on a ship called The Sale. He was the board surgeon, the captain was Willy Winkelmann - a very unapproachable man. Their cook - the most important person on the ship because he had to apply biochemistry and dietetics to cook nourishing food from Chlorella algae - was called Robert Bailey, he was originally from Ohio. Vilanova describes a very tense relationship between the cook and the captain: Willy Winkelmann, an unpleasant person he was, was always mispronouncing the cook's name and criticizing his dishes. \n\nHe served a three-course dinner and the crew thanked him, but the captain found his food disgusting and left the dinner with a small scandal. Later, Bailey talked to the surgeon about the captain and complained about his insulting remarks. Paul assured him that no one could make Winkelmann happy and that the food was way above average. The next day the captain made an offensive comment about Bailey's cooking abilities again. Paul tried to talk to Winkelmann about his harsh attitude towards Bailey, and the captain said that he believed this attitude would make the cook improvise and experiment more. Paul disagreed but was soon told to leave. Bailey started avoiding the captain but was still called from the kitchen almost every time. The other crew members enjoyed this conflict since it made Bailey cook in a more creative way. One day Paul even learned that instead of taking anything meaningful on the board Winkelmann had just brought a box of ketchup to help him eat the spacers’ food and humiliate Bailey even more. After another offensive monologue from the captain, the cook became angry and started talking back, but Winkelmann quickly excused him and Paul, who had tried to defend Bailey. Later Paul gave the cook some rye and listened to him cursing and insulting the captain. The next morning Bailey cooked something unusually disgusting, and the captain realized he had lost and decided to give the cook a word of praise. Sometime later, Bailey managed to make the best dish he had made so far - the steaks tasted like real food, not the algae. After a small chat, Paul and Bailey both agreed that Winkelmann had significantly contributed to Bailey's success by criticizing his food and driving the cook more eager to prove himself.

You can\ntake the plane to Munich, spend a\nweek there and—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simon was shaking his head. \"Not\ninterested.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As soon as Betty had got her jaw\nback into place, she glared unbelievingly\nat him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.\n\"See here, young man, I realize\nthis isn't an ordinary assignment,\nhowever, as I said, I am willing to\nrisk a considerable portion of my\nfortune—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be\ndone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"\nMr. Oyster said quietly. \"I\nlike the fact that you already seem\nto have some interest and knowledge\nof the matter. I liked the way you\nknew my name when I walked in the\ndoor; my picture doesn't appear often\nin the papers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality\nin his voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if\nyou bring me a time traveler.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out of the question,\" Simon\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But\n  <i>\n   why\n  </i>\n  ?\" Betty wailed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the\ntwo of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\nyou a funny story. It goes like\nthis:\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"hrmin\"/>\n <p>\n  I got a thousand dollars from Mr.\nOyster (Simon began) in the way\nof an advance, and leaving him with\nBetty who was making out a receipt,\nI hustled back to the apartment and\npacked a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\nanyway, this was a natural. On\nthe way to Idlewild I stopped off at\nthe Germany Information Offices for\nsome tourist literature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It takes roughly three and a half\nhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\nI spent the time planning the\nfun I was going to have.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It takes roughly seven and a half\nhours from Gander to Shannon and\nI spent that time dreaming up material\nI could put into my reports to\nMr. Oyster. I was going to have to\ngive him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a\nlaugh!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Between Shannon and Munich a\nfaint suspicion began to simmer in\nmy mind. These statistics I read on\nthe\n  <i>\n   Oktoberfest\n  </i>\n  in the Munich tourist\npamphlets. Five million people\nattended annually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where did five million people\ncome from to attend an overgrown\nfestival in comparatively remote\nSouthern Germany? The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <i>\n   Theresienwiese\n  </i>\n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway. I was stiff from the plane ride\nso I walked.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  There are seven major brewers in\nthe Munich area, each of them represented\nby one of the circuslike tents\nthat Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent\ncontained benches and tables for\nabout five thousand persons and from\nsix to ten thousands pack themselves\nin, competing for room. In the center\nis a tremendous bandstand, the\nmusicians all\n  <i>\n   lederhosen\n  </i>\n  clad, the\nmusic as Bavarian as any to be found\nin a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of\npeasant garbed\n  <i>\n   fräuleins\n  </i>\n  darted about\nthe tables with quart sized earthenware\nmugs, platters of chicken, sausage,\nkraut and pretzels.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found a place finally at a table\nwhich had space for twenty-odd beer\nbibbers. Odd is right. As weird an\nassortment of Germans and foreign\ntourists as could have been dreamed\nup, ranging from a seventy- or\neighty-year-old couple in Bavarian\ncostume, to the bald-headed drunk\nacross the table from me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A desperate waitress bearing six\nmugs of beer in each hand scurried\npast. They call them\n  <i>\n   masses\n  </i>\n  , by the\nway, not mugs. The bald-headed\ncharacter and I both held up a finger\nand she slid two of the\n  <i>\n   masses\n  </i>\n  over\nto us and then hustled on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,\nholding up his\n  <i>\n   mass\n  </i>\n  in toast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before\nsipping, I said, \"You know, the\ntourist pamphlets say this stuff is\neighteen per cent. That's nonsense.\nNo beer is that strong.\" I took a long\npull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me, waiting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A\n  <i>\n   mass\n  </i>\n  or two apiece later he looked\ncarefully at the name engraved on\nhis earthenware mug. \"Löwenbräu,\"\nhe said. He took a small notebook\nfrom his pocket and a pencil, noted\ndown the word and returned the\nthings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's a queer looking pencil you\nhave there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.\nShouldn't have said that.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had never heard of the brand so\nI skipped it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Next is the Hofbräu,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation\ndidn't seem to hang together very\nwell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All\nmy life I've been wanting to go back\nto an\n  <i>\n   Oktoberfest\n  </i>\n  and sample every\none of the seven brands of the best\nbeer the world has ever known. I'm\nonly as far as Löwenbräu. I'm afraid\nI'll never make it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I finished my\n  <i>\n   mass\n  </i>\n  . \"I'll help\nyou,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.\nName is Simon.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you\nhelp?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm still fresh—comparatively.\nI'll navigate you around. There are\nseven beer tents. How many have you\ngot through, so far?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked at him. \"It's going to be\na chore,\" I said. \"You've already got\na nice edge on.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, as we made our way to\nthe next tent, the fair looked like\nevery big State-Fair ever seen, except\nit was bigger. Games, souvenir\nstands, sausage stands, rides, side\nshows, and people, people, people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Hofbräu tent was as overflowing\nas the last but we managed to\nfind two seats.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The band was blaring, and five\nthousand half-swacked voices were\nroaring accompaniment.\n </p>\n <i>\n  In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!\n </i>\n <br/>\n <i>\n  Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!\n </i>\n <br/>\n <p>\n  At the\n  <i>\n   G'sufa\n  </i>\n  everybody upped\nwith the mugs and drank each other's\nhealth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This is what I call a real beer\nbust,\" I said approvingly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth was waving to a waitress. As\nin the Löwenbräu tent, a full quart\nwas the smallest amount obtainable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A beer later I said, \"I don't know\nif you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Make what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All seven tents.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A waitress was on her way by,\nmugs foaming over their rims. I gestured\nto her for refills.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I\nasked him, in the way of making\nconversation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"2183.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"2183 where?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He looked at me, closing one eye\nto focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,\n2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"New Albuquerque? Where's\nthat?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth thought about it. Took another\nlong pull at the beer. \"Right\nacross the way from old Albuquerque,\"\nhe said finally. \"Maybe we\nought to be getting on to the\nPschorrbräu tent.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe we ought to eat something\nfirst,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel\nthis. We could get some of that barbecued\nox.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth closed his eyes in pain.\n\"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly\neat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"\nI said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"There's supposed to be considerable\nnourishment in beer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That made sense. I yelled, \"\n  <i>\n   Fräulein!\nZwei neu bier!\n  </i>\n  \"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Somewhere along in here the fog\nrolled in. When it rolled out again,\nI found myself closing one eye the\nbetter to read the lettering on my\nearthenware mug. It read Augustinerbräu.\nSomehow we'd evidently\nnavigated from one tent to another.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth was saying, \"Where's your\nhotel?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  That seemed like a good question.\nI thought about it for a while. Finally\nI said, \"Haven't got one. Town's\njam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.\nI don't think we'll ever make\nit, Arth. How many we got to\ngo?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can\ncome home with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We drank to that and the fog rolled\nin again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the fog rolled out, it was\ndaylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.\nI was sprawled, complete with\nclothes, on one of twin beds. On the\nother bed, also completely clothed,\nwas Arth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That sun was too much. I stumbled\nup from the bed, staggered to\nthe window and fumbled around for\na blind or curtain. There was none.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Behind me a voice said in horror,\n\"Who ... how ... oh,\n  <i>\n   Wodo\n  </i>\n  ,\nwhere'd you come from?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got a quick impression, looking\nout the window, that the Germans\nwere certainly the most modern, futuristic\npeople in the world. But I\ncouldn't stand the light. \"Where's\nthe shade,\" I moaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth did something and the window\nwent opaque.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.\n\"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd\nappreciate it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth was sitting on the edge of\nthe bed holding his bald head in his\nhands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.\n\"You didn't have a hotel.\nWhat a stupidity. I'll be phased.\nPhased all the way down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You haven't got a handful of\naspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering\nerect and heading for what\nundoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay\nwhere you are. Don't move. Don't\ntouch anything.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.\n\"I'm clean. I won't mess up the\nplace. All I've got is a hangover, not\nlice.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth was gone. He came back in\ntwo or three minutes, box of pills in\nhand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took the pill, followed it with a\nglass of water.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  And went out like a light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want\nanother\n  <i>\n   mass\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The band was blaring, and five\nthousand half-swacked voices were\nroaring accompaniment.\n </p>\n <i>\n  In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!\n </i>\n <br/>\n <i>\n  Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!\n </i>\n <br/>\n <p>\n  At the\n  <i>\n   G'sufa\n  </i>\n  everybody upped\nwith their king-size mugs and drank\neach other's health.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My head was killing me. \"This is\nwhere I came in, or something,\" I\ngroaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth said, \"That was last night.\"\nHe looked at me over the rim of his\nbeer mug.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something, somewhere, was\nwrong. But I didn't care. I finished\nmy\n  <i>\n   mass\n  </i>\n  and then remembered. \"I've\ngot to get my bag. Oh, my head.\nWhere did we spend last night?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth said, and his voice sounded\ncautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I\nfeel lousy. I must have dimmed out.\nI've got to go to the Bahnhof and\nget my luggage.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arth didn't put up an argument\non that. We said good-by and I could\nfeel him watching after me as I pushed\nthrough the tables on the way\nout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the Bahnhof they could do me\nno good. There were no hotel rooms\navailable in Munich. The head was\ngetting worse by the minute. The\nfact that they'd somehow managed\nto lose my bag didn't help. I worked\non that project for at least a couple\nof hours. Not only wasn't the bag\nat the luggage checking station, but\nthe attendant there evidently couldn't\nmake heads nor tails of the check\nreceipt. He didn't speak English and\nmy high school German was inadequate,\nespecially accompanied by a\nblockbusting hangover.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't get anywhere tearing my\nhair and complaining from one end\nof the Bahnhof to the other. I drew\na blank on the bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the head was getting worse\nby the minute. I was bleeding to\ndeath through the eyes and instead\nof butterflies I had bats in my stomach.\nBelieve me,\n  <i>\n   nobody\n  </i>\n  should drink\na gallon or more of Marzenbräu.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  I decided the hell with it. I took\na cab to the airport, presented my return\nticket, told them I wanted to\nleave on the first obtainable plane to\nNew York. I'd spent two days at the\n  <i>\n   Oktoberfest\n  </i>\n  , and I'd had it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got more guff there. Something\nwas wrong with the ticket, wrong\ndate or some such. But they fixed\nthat up. I never was clear on what\nwas fouled up, some clerk's error,\nevidently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The trip back was as uninteresting\nas the one over. As the hangover began\nto wear off—a little—I was almost\nsorry I hadn't been able to stay.\nIf I'd only been able to get a room I\n  <i>\n   would\n  </i>\n  have stayed, I told myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From Idlewild, I came directly to\nthe office rather than going to my\napartment. I figured I might as well\ncheck in with Betty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened the door and there I\nfound Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair\nhe had been occupying four—or was\nit five—days before when I'd left.\nI'd lost track of the time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said to him, \"Glad you're here,\nsir. I can report. Ah, what was it\nyou came for? Impatient to hear if\nI'd had any results?\" My mind was\nspinning like a whirling dervish in\na revolving door. I'd spent a wad of\nhis money and had nothing I could\nthink of to show for it; nothing but\nthe last stages of a grand-daddy\nhangover.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.\n\"I'm merely waiting for your girl to\nmake out my receipt. I thought you\nhad already left.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty\nsaid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was suddenly a double dip\nof ice cream in my stomach. I walked\nover to my desk and looked down at\nthe calendar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mr. Oyster was saying something\nto the effect that if I didn't leave today,\nit would have to be tomorrow,\nthat he hadn't ponied up that thousand\ndollars advance for anything\nless than immediate service. Stuffing\nhis receipt in his wallet, he fussed\nhis way out the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose\nyou haven't changed this calendar\nsince I left.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Betty said, \"What's the matter\nwith you? You look funny. How did\nyour clothes get so mussed? You tore\nthe top sheet off that calendar yourself,\nnot half an hour ago, just before\nthis marble-missing client came\nin.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time\ntravelers yet.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried just once more. \"Uh, when\ndid you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Never saw him before in my\nlife,\" she said. \"Not until he came\nin this morning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While Betty stared at me as though\nit was\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  that needed candling by a\nhead shrinker preparatory to being\nsent off to a pressure cooker, I fished\nin my pocket for my wallet, counted\nthe contents and winced at the\npathetic remains of the thousand.\nI said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,\nhow long ago did I go out that door—on\nthe way to the airport?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You've been acting sick all morning.\nYou went out that door about\nten minutes ago, were gone about\nthree minutes, and then came back.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"hrmin\"/>\n <p>\n  \"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting\nSimon's story), \"did you\nsay this was supposed to be amusing,\nyoung man? I don't find it so. In\nfact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simon shrugged, put one hand to\nhis forehead and said, \"That's only\nthe first chapter. There are two\nmore.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr.\nOyster said. \"I suppose your point\nwas to show me how ridiculous the\nwhole idea actually is. Very well,\nyou've done it. Confound it. However,\nI suppose your time, even when\nspent in this manner, has some value.\nHere is fifty dollars. And good day,\nsir!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He slammed the door after him\nas he left.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simon winced at the noise, took\nthe aspirin bottle from its drawer,\ntook two, washed them down with\nwater from the desk carafe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Betty looked at him admiringly.\nCame to her feet, crossed over and\ntook up the fifty dollars. \"Week's\nwages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's\none way of taking care of a crackpot.\nBut I'm surprised you didn't\ntake his money and enjoy that vacation\nyou've been yearning about.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three\ntimes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Betty stared at him. \"You mean—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simon nodded, miserably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"But\n  <i>\n   Simon\n  </i>\n  . Fifty thousand\ndollars bonus. If that story was\ntrue, you should have gone back\nagain to Munich. If there was one\ntime traveler, there might have\nbeen—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said\nbitterly, \"I went back there three\ntimes. There were hundreds of them.\nProbably thousands.\" He took a deep\nbreath. \"Listen, we're just going to\nhave to forget about it. They're not\ngoing to stand for the space-time\ncontinuum track being altered. If\nsomething comes up that looks like\nit might result in the track being\nchanged, they set you right back at\nthe beginning and let things start—for\nyou—all over again. They just\ncan't allow anything to come back\nfrom the future and change the\npast.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly\nfurious at him, \"you've given up!\nWhy this is the biggest thing— Why\nthe fifty thousand dollars is nothing.\nThe future! Just think!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Simon said wearily, \"There's just\none thing you can bring back with\nyou from the future, a hangover compounded\nof a gallon or so of Marzenbräu.\nWhat's more you can pile\none on top of the other, and another\non top of that!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shuddered. \"If you think I'm\ngoing to take another crack at this\nmerry-go-round and pile a fourth\nhangover on the three I'm already\nnursing, all at once, you can think\nagain.\"\n </p>\n <p class=\"theend\">\n  THE END\n </p>\n <b>\n  Transcriber's Note:\n </b>\n <br/>\n This etext was produced from\n <i>\n  Astounding Science Fiction\n </i>\n June\n1959.

He tells her that he needs a vacation, but she asks him where the funds will come from and her weekly salary. Suddenly, the door knocks, and a man named Mr. Oyster comes in. Despite having never met before, he is impressed that Simon knows him and asks the other man if he believes in time travel. Betty says it is impossible, and Mr. Oyster questions her about why. Simon then asks why he came, to which the potential client responds that he wants them to hunt up some time travelers. He asks Betty some more about science fiction and explains that he is willing to gamble his fortune to investigate the presence of time travelers in the current era. Mr. Oyster further says that these time travelers will be at the Oktoberfest in Munich, which is considered the greatest festival globally. Simon says that he is not interested in taking up the case. Betty is surprised, and Mr. Oyster tries to offer him a substantial amount of money. Simon then tells them a story where he accepts Mr. Oyster’s offer. Simon thinks about how much fun he will have and a fake report to generate for Mr. Oyster. He then goes on to be suspicious about how five million people can appear to attend a festival in a remote part of southern Germany, especially considering the population of Munich is less than one million. There is no hotel space in Munch, so Simon must go to Bahnhof to apply for hotel service. It is suspicious how the five million attendees are accommodated for this festival. The circus-like tents represent the seven major brewers of the Munich area, and many people are going around. Simon finds a space at one of the tables; he notes that the crowd is made up of both tourists and Germans. A bald-headed person and he both drink beer. The bald man accidentally reveals that his pencil is Venusian and tells Simon that his dream is to sample each of the seven best beer brands. The man then introduces himself as Arth and tells Simon that he is from a strange location. Arth offers to take him to his hotel later, and Simon goes with him. Arth gives him a box of pills for his hangover, and the scene cuts to them drinking at the festival again. Simon feels that something is off and decides to go back to New York. He returns to the office, where Mr. Oyster tells him that Betty has just finished the receipt. They are both confused and say that he has only been gone for about three minutes. Mr. Oyster is furious and leaves, while Betty asks why he didn’t just take the money. Simon tells her that he experienced the trip three times and says that he will not be dealing with a fourth hangover on top of the three already-present ones.

When he gets to Munich, he cannot find a hotel to stay in since there are too many people to be accommodated. While drinking in the big tent held by the local brewery, Simon meets a guy who wants to try all the beer. He then accompanies him to drink. When they get drunk, Simon tells the guy that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay, and the guy invites him to his place. While they talk in the guy’s place, the guy carelessly leaks information about where he comes from, which seems like a time traveler. On the following day, when the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he tells Simon not to move and goes into the bathroom. After he comes out, he gives Simon a pill and lets him go.

Simon expands on the latter’s desire as to him wanting the investigators to exhort from the time traveler some secret of eternal youth, and hence be willing to pay a premium rate of upwards of fifty thousand dollars. Despite this generous amount, Simon declines, and instead tells the pair a story. \n\nThe story goes: he took a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster as an advance and departed on the first flight out to Germany. When he arrived at the festival, Simon found an available space in a brewers tent. He sat down across a bald-headed man who appeared to be noting down the various beers being tried. Introducing himself as Arth, Simon and Arth end up traversing the rest of the festival’s breweries together, getting more and more inebriated with each one. After a while, both of them head back to Arth’s hotel and pass out. The next morning, Arth is surprised to find Simon and gives him a pill to help with Simon’s hangover. In the next scene, Simon finds them the next day back at the festival, nursing another mug of beer. With a terrible hangover and not remembering the details of the previous night, Simon says his goodbyes and heads to pick up his luggage, only to find it lost. He decided to head to the airport and fly out without it, found himself with a momentary bump with a ticketing error, and went directly to his office after landing. At the office, Simon is surprised to find Mr. Oyster there, surmising that he is eager to get the report. However, as Betty expresses that she just met Mr. Oyster that morning, he soon realizes that he somehow indeed time traveled. \n\nWhen Simon finished telling his story, Mr. Oyster is in disbelief and believes that he is being ridiculed and storms out of the office, leaving behind fifty dollars for the investigator's time. Betty comments that he is surprised he didn’t take the offer. Simon reveals that he did, actually, three times. It turns out that Mr. Oyster’s hypothesis on time travelers’ existence and their congregation at Oktoberfest was correct. However, these time travelers - like Arth - will immediately reset the track if the space-time continuum was threatened - like they did to Simon. Nursing several hangovers, Simon implores Betty to let it go.\n"}, {"worker_id": "111", "uid": "854a8a7afac244c19e839bdfd0001b97", "response_text": "This story centers around two private investigators, Betty and Simon. Betty seems to be working under Simon, and asks Simon for her payment. They have a little disagreement, but it ends when a new client arrives. The client is Mr. Oyster, an old and rich man who is looking to find time travelers and is willing to pay handsomely. After the 3 of them go back and forth debating about the existence of time travel, Simon starts to tell a story about him going to Oktoberfest, and how an entanglement with a time traveler could go. The story starts with Simon arriving at the festival, and immediately becomes friends with a time traveler, Arth. After drinking together, they end up going to Arth’s hotel. When Simon wakes up, he is in a very futuristic room. When Arth notices him, he gives him a pill and then Simon wakes up in the Oktoberfest again. Arth tells him it is the day after, but Simon ends up going back to New York. When he gets there, he arrives not 10 minutes later after he left. After the story ends, he rejects Mr. Oyster’s proposal and it is revealed the story was real, and that Simon had in fact gone to the future with Arth, and had found time travelers.

The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, the\nhumidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball in\na cloudless blue sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His pockets were picked eleven times.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was a\nmasterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was Humphrey\nFownes' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. He\nwas strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses,\none after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions.\nBut he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject to\nbegin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking so\ndeeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too many\npeople were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum Dome\nConditions (a crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%) when a bogus\npostman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In the\nconfusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postman\nrifled Fownes's handkerchief and inside jacket pockets.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He was still thinking about temperature and humidity when a pretty girl\nhappened along with something in her eye. They collided. She got his\nright and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence.\nThe sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time.\nHe should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in a\nheated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied his\nrear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of the\nhandkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of put\nand take—the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea he\nwas playing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist,\nhitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings of\na celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-light\nfragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Dome\nweevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed the\nhuge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass still\nintrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humidity\nthat was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was this\nrather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tight\nsurveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of getting\nhis fingerprints off the postman's bag, and which photographed, X-rayed\nand chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returning\nthem. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled a\nfive-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster of\nParis. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight and\nhandedness behind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier complete\nwith photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in an\norange patrol car parked down the street.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Lanfierre had undoubtedly been affected by his job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sitting behind the wheel of the orange car, he watched Humphrey Fownes\napproach with a distinct feeling of admiration, although it was an\nodd, objective kind of admiration, clinical in nature. It was similar\nto that of a pathologist observing for the first time a new and\nparticularly virulent strain of pneumococcus under his microscope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lanfierre's job was to ferret out aberration. It couldn't be tolerated\nwithin the confines of a dome. Conformity had become more than a social\nforce; it was a physical necessity. And, after years of working at it,\nLanfierre had become an admirer of eccentricity. He came to see that\ngenuine quirks were rare and, as time went on, due partly to his own\nsmall efforts, rarer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fownes was a masterpiece of queerness. He was utterly inexplicable.\nLanfierre was almost proud of Humphrey Fownes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sometimes his house\n  <i>\n   shakes\n  </i>\n  ,\" Lanfierre said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"House shakes,\" Lieutenant MacBride wrote in his notebook. Then he\nstopped and frowned. He reread what he'd just written.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You heard right. The house\n  <i>\n   shakes\n  </i>\n  ,\" Lanfierre said, savoring it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacBride looked at the Fownes house through the magnifying glass of\nthe windshield. \"Like from ...\n  <i>\n   side to side\n  </i>\n  ?\" he asked in a somewhat\npatronizing tone of voice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And up and down.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacBride returned the notebook to the breast pocket of his orange\nuniform. \"Go on,\" he said, amused. \"It sounds interesting.\" He tossed\nthe dossier carelessly on the back seat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the wheel, affronted. The cynical MacBride\ncouldn't really appreciate fine aberrations. In some ways MacBride\nwas a barbarian. Lanfierre had held out on Fownes for months. He\nhad even contrived to engage him in conversation once, a pleasantly\nabsurd, irrational little chat that titillated him for weeks. It was\nonly with the greatest reluctance that he finally mentioned Fownes\nto MacBride. After years of searching for differences Lanfierre had\nseen how extraordinarily repetitious people were, echoes really, dimly\nresounding echoes, each believing itself whole and separate. They spoke\nin an incessant chatter of cliches, and their actions were unbelievably\ntrite.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then a fine robust freak came along and the others—the echoes—refused\nto believe it. The lieutenant was probably on the point of suggesting a\nvacation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Why don't you take a vacation?\" Lieutenant MacBride suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's like this, MacBride. Do you know what a wind is? A breeze? A\nzephyr?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've heard some.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They say there are mountain-tops where winds blow all the time. Strong\nwinds, MacBride. Winds like you and I can't imagine. And if there was\na house sitting on such a mountain and if winds\n  <i>\n   did\n  </i>\n  blow, it would\nshake exactly the way that one does. Sometimes I get the feeling the\nwhole place is going to slide off its foundation and go sailing down\nthe avenue.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Lieutenant MacBride pursed his lips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll tell you something else,\" Lanfierre went on. \"The\n  <i>\n   windows\n  </i>\n  all\nclose at the same time. You'll be watching and all of a sudden every\nsingle window in the place will drop to its sill.\" Lanfierre leaned\nback in the seat, his eyes still on the house. \"Sometimes I think\nthere's a whole crowd of people in there waiting for a signal—as if\nthey all had something important to say but had to close the windows\nfirst so no one could hear. Why else close the windows in a domed city?\nAnd then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into\nconversation—and that's why the house shakes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacBride whistled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, I don't need a vacation.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the\nwindshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, you don't need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You're starting to see\nflying houses, hear loud babbling voices. You've got winds in your\nbrain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigue, zephyrs of irrationality—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  At that moment, all at once, every last window in the house slammed\nshut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The street was deserted and quiet, not a movement, not a sound.\nMacBride and Lanfierre both leaned forward, as if waiting for the\nghostly babble of voices to commence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The house began to shake.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It rocked from side to side, it pitched forward and back, it yawed and\ndipped and twisted, straining at the mooring of its foundation. The\nhouse could have been preparing to take off and sail down the....\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacBride looked at Lanfierre and Lanfierre looked at MacBride and then\nthey both looked back at the dancing house.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And the\n  <i>\n   water\n  </i>\n  ,\" Lanfierre said. \"The\n  <i>\n   water\n  </i>\n  he uses! He could be\nthe thirstiest and cleanest man in the city. He could have a whole\nfamily of thirsty and clean kids, and he\n  <i>\n   still\n  </i>\n  wouldn't need all that\nwater.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages\nnow in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did\nyou see what he carries in his pockets?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And compasses won't work on this street.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It\nexpressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got\nneurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There\nwas something implacable about his sighs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\nwith a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at\nthe widow's next door and then the library.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  MacBride's eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he\nsaid. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lanfierre nodded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I can't wait to see what he's got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured,\nwatching the house with a consuming interest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes\nwidened as the house danced a new step.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Fownes stopped on the porch to brush the plaster of paris off his\nshoes. He hadn't seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupation\nof his was also responsible for the dancing house—he simply hadn't\nnoticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. He\nhad a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and the\nhigh-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of the\nhouse. At least, he called it buffeting; he'd never thought to watch\nfrom outside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no room\nleft in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist a\ndraw-pull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Every window slammed shut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tight as a kite,\" he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward the\ncloset at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was that\nright? No,\n  <i>\n   snug as a hug in a rug\n  </i>\n  . He went on, thinking:\n  <i>\n   The old\ndevils.\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion of\nwheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-saw\nthat went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had a\ncurious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged from\ngrandfather's clocks and music boxes and they went around in graceful\ncircles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although there\nwas one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. He\nwatched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them for\nseven o'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside, the domed city vanished.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear,\nthe illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a more\nsatisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion.\nLooking through the window he saw only a garden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sun\nsetting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which left\nthe smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid a\nhuge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon a\ngarden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory.\n  <i>\n   And cocktails for\ntwo.\n  </i>\n  Blast, he'd never be able to figure that one out! He watched as\nthe moon played,\n  <i>\n   Oh, You Beautiful Doll\n  </i>\n  and the neon roses flashed\nslowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned on\nthe scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated rose\nas the moon shifted to\n  <i>\n   People Will Say We're In Love\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He rubbed his chin critically. It\n  <i>\n   seemed\n  </i>\n  all right. A dreamy sunset,\nan enchanted moon, flowers, scent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were all purely speculative of course. He had no idea how a rose\nreally smelled—or looked for that matter. Not to mention a moon. But\nthen, neither did the widow. He'd have to be confident, assertive.\n  <i>\n   Insist\n  </i>\n  on it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realistic\nromantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icy\nfingers marching up and down your spine?\n </p>\n <p>\n  His own spine didn't seem to be affected. But then he hadn't read that\nbook on ancient mores and courtship customs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incredibly\nlong and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amount\nof falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. \"No\"\nmeant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and the\ncircumstances. It could mean yes, it could mean ask me again later on\nthis evening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went up the stairs to the bedroom closet and tried the rain-maker,\nthinking roguishly:\n  <i>\n   Thou shalt not inundate.\n  </i>\n  The risks he was taking!\nA shower fell gently on the garden and a male chorus began to chant\n  <i>\n   Singing in the Rain\n  </i>\n  . Undiminished, the yellow moon and the red sun\ncontinued to be brilliant, although the sun occasionally arced over and\ndemolished several of the neon roses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The last wheel in the bedroom closet was a rather elegant steering\nwheel from an old 1995 Studebaker. This was on the bootleg pipe; he\ngingerly turned it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Far below in the cellar there was a rumble and then the soft whistle of\nwinds came to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He went downstairs to watch out the living room window. This was\nimportant; the window had a really fixed attitude about air currents.\nThe neon roses bent and tinkled against each other as the wind rose and\nthe moon shook a trifle as it whispered\n  <i>\n   Cuddle Up a Little Closer\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  He watched with folded arms, considering how he would start.\n  <i>\n   My dear\nMrs. Deshazaway.\n  </i>\n  Too formal. They'd be looking out at the romantic\ngarden; time to be a bit forward.\n  <i>\n   My very dear Mrs. Deshazaway.\n  </i>\n  No.\nContrived. How about a simple,\n  <i>\n   Dear Mrs. Deshazaway\n  </i>\n  . That might be\nit.\n  <i>\n   I was wondering, seeing as how it's so late, if you wouldn't\nrather stay over instead of going home....\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Preoccupied, he hadn't noticed the winds building up, didn't hear the\nshaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connected\nto wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they made\none gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance as\nhigh-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening the\nStudebaker valve wider and wider....\n </p>\n <p>\n  The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other. The red sun\nshot off a mass of sparks and then quickly sank out of sight. The moon\nfell on the garden and rolled ponderously along, crooning\n  <i>\n   When the\nBlue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day\n  </i>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The shaking house finally woke him up. He scrambled upstairs to the\nStudebaker wheel and shut it off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the window again, he sighed. Repairs were in order. And it wasn't\nthe first time the winds got out of line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why didn't she marry him and save all this bother? He shut it all down\nand went out the front door, wondering about the rhyme of the months,\nabout stately August and eccentric February and romantic April. April.\nIts days were thirty and it followed September.\n  <i>\n   And all the rest have\nthirty-one.\n  </i>\n  What a strange people, the ancients!\n </p>\n <p>\n  He still didn't see the orange car parked down the street.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  \"Men are too perishable,\" Mrs. Deshazaway said over dinner. \"For all\npractical purposes I'm never going to marry again. All my husbands die.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Would you pass the beets, please?\" Humphrey Fownes said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. \"And don't look at me\nthat way,\" she said. \"I'm\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  going to marry you and if you want\nreasons I'll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything\npassionately—talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately\nred. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry\ntinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had\nnever known anyone like her. \"You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,\"\nshe said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for\nher to be, to explain why she couldn't marry him. \"Do you have any\nidea what people are saying? They're all saying I'm a cannibal! I rob\nmy husbands of their life force and when they're empty I carry their\nbodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"As long as there are people,\" he said philosophically, \"there'll be\ntalk.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But it's the air! Why don't they talk about that? The air is stale,\nI'm positive. It's not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt,\nNorman and Alphonse couldn't stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so\nhealthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily\nworse for him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't seem to mind the air.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She threw up her hands. \"You'd be the worst of the lot!\" She left the\ntable, rustling and tinkling about the room. \"I can just hear them. Try\nsome of the asparagus.\n  <i>\n   Five.\n  </i>\n  That's what they'd say. That woman did\nit again. And the plain fact is I don't want you on my record.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Really,\" Fownes protested. \"I feel splendid. Never better.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his\nshoulders. \"And what about those\n  <i>\n   very\n  </i>\n  elaborate plans you've been\nmaking to seduce me?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Don't you think\n  <i>\n   they'll\n  </i>\n  find out?\n  <i>\n   I\n  </i>\n  found out and you can bet\n  <i>\n   they\n  </i>\n  will. It's my fault, I guess. I talk too much. And I don't\nalways tell the truth. To be completely honest with you, Mr. Fownes, it\nwasn't the old customs at all standing between us, it was air. I can't\nhave another man die on me, it's bad for my self-esteem. And now you've\ngone and done something good and criminal, something peculiar.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Fownes put his fork down. \"Dear Mrs. Deshazaway,\" he started to say.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And of course when they do find out and they ask you why, Mr. Fownes,\nyou'll tell them. No, no heroics, please! When they ask a man a\nquestion he always answers and you will too. You'll tell them I wanted\nto be courted and when they hear that they'll be around to ask\n  <i>\n   me\n  </i>\n  a\nfew questions. You see, we're both a bit queer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I hadn't thought of that,\" Fownes said quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh, it doesn't really matter. I'll join Andrew, Curt, Norman—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Fownes said with unusual force. \"With all\ndue respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well state\nhere and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"But my dear Mr. Fownes,\" she said, leaning across the table. \"We're\nlost, you and I.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not if we could leave the dome,\" Fownes said quietly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's impossible! How?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In no hurry, now that he had the widow's complete attention, Fownes\nleaned across the table and whispered: \"Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway?\nSpace? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has\nno control whatever? Where the\n  <i>\n   wind\n  </i>\n  blows across\n  <i>\n   prairies\n  </i>\n  ; or is\nit the other way around? No matter. How would you like\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  , Mrs.\nDeshazaway?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her\ntwo hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway.\nAnd June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is\nsupposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond\nthe dome.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I see.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   And\n  </i>\n  ,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say\nthat somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight,\nthe sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it's\n  <i>\n   vernal\n  </i>\n  and that's when it roams the Open Country where geigers no\nlonger scintillate.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   My.\n  </i>\n  \" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came\nback to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us\noutside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays\n  <i>\n   warm\n  </i>\n  long enough\nfor his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ...\nyou may call me Agnes.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  When Humphrey Fownes stepped out of the widow's house, there was a\nlook of such intense abstraction on his features that Lanfierre felt a\nwistful desire to get out of the car and walk along with the man. It\nwould be such a\n  <i>\n   deliciously\n  </i>\n  insane experience. (\"April has thirty\ndays,\" Fownes mumbled, passing them, \"because thirty is the largest\nnumber such that all smaller numbers not having a common divisor\nwith it are\n  <i>\n   primes\n  </i>\n  .\" MacBride frowned and added it to the dossier.\nLanfierre sighed.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pinning his hopes on the Movement, Fownes went straight to the\nlibrary several blocks away, a shattered depressing place given over\nto government publications and censored old books with holes in\nthem. It was used so infrequently that the Movement was able to meet\nthere undisturbed. The librarian was a yellowed, dog-eared woman of\neighty. She spent her days reading ancient library cards and, like the\nbooks around her, had been rendered by time's own censor into near\nunintelligibility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Here's one,\" she said to him as he entered. \"\n  <i>\n   Gulliver's Travels.\n  </i>\n  Loaned to John Wesley Davidson on March 14, 1979 for\n  <i>\n   five\n  </i>\n  days. What\ndo you make of it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the litter of books and cards and dried out ink pads that surrounded\nthe librarian, Fownes noticed a torn dust jacket with a curious\nillustration. \"What's that?\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"A twister,\" she replied quickly. \"Now listen to\n  <i>\n   this\n  </i>\n  . Seven years\nlater on March 21, 1986, Ella Marshall Davidson took out the same book.\nWhat do you make of\n  <i>\n   that\n  </i>\n  ?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd say,\" Humphrey Fownes said, \"that he ... that he recommended it\nto her, that one day they met in the street and he told her about\nthis book and then they ... they went to the library together and she\nborrowed it and eventually, why eventually they got married.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hah! They were brother and sister!\" the librarian shouted in her\nparched voice, her old buckram eyes laughing with cunning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fownes smiled weakly and looked again at the dust jacket. The twister\nwas unquestionably a meteorological phenomenon. It spun ominously, like\na malevolent top, and coursed the countryside destructively, carrying\na Dorothy to an Oz. He couldn't help wondering if twisters did anything\nto feminine pulses, if they could possibly be a part of a moonlit\nnight, with cocktails and roses. He absently stuffed the dust jacket\nin his pocket and went on into the other rooms, the librarian mumbling\nafter him: \"Edna Murdoch Featherstone, April 21, 1991,\" as though\nreading inscriptions on a tombstone.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The Movement met in what had been the children's room, where unpaid\nladies of the afternoon had once upon a time read stories to other\npeople's offspring. The members sat around at the miniature tables\nlooking oddly like giants fled from their fairy tales, protesting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where did the old society fail?\" the leader was demanding of them. He\nstood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane. He\nglanced around at the group almost complacently, and waited as Humphrey\nFownes squeezed into an empty chair. \"We live in a dome,\" the leader\nsaid, \"for lack of something. An invention! What is the one thing\nthat the great technological societies before ours could not invent,\nnotwithstanding their various giant brains, electronic and otherwise?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fownes was the kind of man who never answered a rhetorical question. He\nwaited, uncomfortable in the tight chair, while the others struggled\nwith this problem in revolutionary dialectics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   A sound foreign policy\n  </i>\n  ,\" the leader said, aware that no one else had\nobtained the insight. \"If a sound foreign policy can't be created the\nonly alternative is not to have any foreign policy at all. Thus the\nmovement into domes began—\n  <i>\n   by common consent of the governments\n  </i>\n  . This\nis known as self-containment.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dialectically out in left field, Humphrey Fownes waited for a lull\nin the ensuing discussion and then politely inquired how it might be\narranged for him to get out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Out?\" the leader said, frowning. \"Out? Out where?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Outside the dome.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Oh. All in good time, my friend. One day we shall all pick up and\nleave.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"And that day I'll await impatiently,\" Fownes replied with marvelous\ntact, \"because it will be lonely out there for the two of us. My future\nwife and I have to leave\n  <i>\n   now\n  </i>\n  .\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Nonsense. Ridiculous! You have to be prepared for the Open Country.\nYou can't just up and leave, it would be suicide, Fownes. And\ndialectically very poor.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you\n  <i>\n   have\n  </i>\n  discussed preparations, the practical necessities of\nlife in the Open Country. Food, clothing, a weapon perhaps? What else?\nHave I left anything out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The leader sighed. \"The gentleman wants to know if he's left anything\nout,\" he said to the group.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fownes looked around at them, at some dozen pained expressions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Tell the man what he's forgotten,\" the leader said, walking to the far\nwindow and turning his back quite pointedly on them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everyone spoke at the same moment. \"\n  <i>\n   A sound foreign policy\n  </i>\n  ,\" they all\nsaid, it being almost too obvious for words.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  On his way out the librarian shouted at him: \"\n  <i>\n   A Tale of a Tub\n  </i>\n  ,\nthirty-five years overdue!\" She was calculating the fine as he closed\nthe door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Humphrey Fownes' preoccupation finally came to an end when he was one\nblock away from his house. It was then that he realized something\nunusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security police\nwas parked at his front door. And something else was happening too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His house was dancing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one's\nresidence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sight\nthat for the moment he didn't give a thought to what might be causing\nit. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing its\nown independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immense\ncuriosity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched as\nhis favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast of\ncold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. A\nwild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs,\nsuits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofa\ncushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging an\nold, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of his\nancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toying\nwith his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on his\ncheeks. He got hit by a shoe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played over\nhis face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Help!\" Lieutenant MacBride called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on his\ndripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in the\ndistance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Winds\n  </i>\n  ,\" he said in a whisper.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's happening?\" MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   March\n  </i>\n  winds,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What?!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"April showers!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride's lost voice emerged\nfrom the blackness of the living room. \"These are\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  Optimum Dome\nConditions!\" the voice wailed. \"The temperature is\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  59 degrees.\nThe humidity is\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  47%!\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Fownes held his face up to let the rain fall on it. \"Moonlight!\" he\nshouted. \"Roses! My\n  <i>\n   soul\n  </i>\n  for a cocktail for two!\" He grasped the\ndoorway to keep from being blown out of the house.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Are you going to make it stop or aren't you!\" MacBride yelled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll have to tell me what you did first!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I\n  <i>\n   told\n  </i>\n  him not to touch that wheel! Lanfierre. He's in the upstairs\nbedroom!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he heard this Fownes plunged into the house and fought his way\nup the stairs. He found Lanfierre standing outside the bedroom with a\nwheel in his hand.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  \"What have I done?\" Lanfierre asked in the monotone of shock.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fownes took the wheel. It was off a 1995 Studebaker.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm not sure what's going to come of this,\" he said to Lanfierre with\nan astonishing amount of objectivity, \"but the entire dome air supply\nis now coming through my bedroom.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wind screamed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not any more there isn't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  They started down the stairs carefully, but the wind caught them and\nthey quickly reached the bottom in a wet heap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Recruiting Lieutenant MacBride from behind his sofa, the men carefully\nedged out of the house and forced the front door shut.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wind died. The fog dispersed. They stood dripping in the Optimum\nDome Conditions of the bright avenue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I never figured on\n  <i>\n   this\n  </i>\n  ,\" Lanfierre said, shaking his head.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the front door closed the wind quickly built up inside the house.\nThey could see the furnishing whirl past the windows. The house did a\nwild, elated jig.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What kind of a place\n  <i>\n   is\n  </i>\n  this?\" MacBride said, his courage beginning\nto return. He took out his notebook but it was a soggy mess. He tossed\nit away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure, he was\n  <i>\n   different\n  </i>\n  ,\" Lanfierre murmured. \"I knew that much.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the roof blew off they weren't really surprised. With a certain\namount of equanimity they watched it lift off almost gracefully,\nstanding on end for a moment before toppling to the ground. It was\nstrangely slow motion, as was the black twirling cloud that now rose\nout of the master bedroom, spewing shorts and socks and cases every\nwhich way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <i>\n   Now\n  </i>\n  what?\" MacBride said, thoroughly exasperated, as this strange\nblack cloud began to accelerate, whirling about like some malevolent\ntop....\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Humphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he'd found in the library.

The next people are two men who pretend to be in a heated argument. Humphrey continuously thinks about the weather outside; this allows the police to maintain tight surveillance of him. Lanfierre is one of the people in the orange car and thinks about Humphrey Fownes being unique. He tells Lieutenant MacBride that Fownes’ house sometimes shakes, which makes the other man frown. Lanfierre considers MacBride to be a barbarian because he is cynical and cannot appreciate the peculiar nature of Fownes. He goes on to tell him that the windows all close at the same time in the house. MacBride refuses to believe him and tells him to take a rest, but all of the windows close, and the house suddenly begins to shake. They continue to observe the man; Fownes goes into his house and begins to think about his dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway. The house begins to shake more, and he decides that repairs are a must. During his dinner, Mrs. Deshazaway explains how she will never marry again. The widow is a passionate woman, and she passionately tells him he forgot salt on his potatoes during the explanation of why they cannot marry because of the air. When she continues to refuse him, Fownes brings up the idea of leaving the dome city for freedom. She tells him that if they can leave, then she will let him call her by her first name. After the date, he goes to the library, where the old librarian tries to test him with old library cards. The story then cuts to a movement meeting, where the members discuss how the old society failed and the lack of a sound foreign policy. Fownes impatiently explains that he and his future wife must leave now, to which the leader explains that it is impossible because there is no sound foreign policy. When Fownes returns to the house, he finds MacBride in the doorway with dripping hair. MacBride yells that these are not optimum dome conditions, explaining that Lanfierre is in the upstairs bedroom. The entire dome air supply is going through his bedroom, and a strange black cloud appears. Fownes recognizes this as a Kansas twister and runs towards the next house for Mrs. Deshazaway.

MacBride is skeptical but unexpectedly all the windows actually slam shut in one second and the walls start wobbling.

His stomach\nfelt sick.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"that Pete assembled\nthese robots in a batch and then\nactivated them all at once, probably\nnever living to realize that\nthey're tuned to pick up human\nbrain waves, too. Damn!\nDamn!\" His eyes blurred and\nhe slammed his fist into the soft\nearth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he raised his eyes again\nthe jungle was perceptibly darker.\nStealthy rustlings in the\nshadows grew louder with the\nsetting sun. Branches snapped\nunaccountably in the trees overhead\nand every now and then\nleaves or a twig fell softly to the\nground, close to where he lay.\nReaching into his jacket, Alan\nfingered his pocket blaster. He\npulled it out and held it in his\nright hand. \"This pop gun\nwouldn't even singe a robot, but\nit just might stop one of those\npumas.\"\n </p>\n <b>\n  They said the blast with your name on it would find\nyou anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.\n </b>\n <p>\n  Slowly Alan looked around,\nsizing up his situation. Behind\nhim the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\nHe shuddered. \"Not a\nvery healthy spot to spend the\nnight. On the other hand, I certainly\ncan't get to the camp with\na pack of mind-activated mechanical\nkillers running around.\nIf I can just hold out until morning,\nwhen the big ship arrives ...\nThe big ship! Good\nLord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\noily sweat punctuated his forehead.\nPeggy, arriving tomorrow\nwith the other colonists, the\nwives and kids! The metal killers,\ntuned to blast any living\nflesh, would murder them the\ninstant they stepped from the\nship!\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\nhe'd married just three weeks\nago. He still couldn't believe it.\nIt was crazy, he supposed, to\nmarry a girl and then take off\nfor an unknown planet, with her\nto follow, to try to create a home\nin a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\nbut Peggy and her green eyes\nthat changed color with the\nlight, with her soft brown hair,\nand her happy smile, had ended\nthirty years of loneliness and\nhad, at last, given him a reason\nfor living. \"Not to be killed!\"\nAlan unclenched his fists and\nwiped his palms, bloody where\nhis fingernails had dug into the\nflesh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a slight creak above\nhim like the protesting of a\nbranch too heavily laden. Blaster\nready, Alan rolled over onto his\nback. In the movement, his elbow\nstruck the top of a small\nearthy mound and he was instantly\nengulfed in a swarm of\nlocust-like insects that beat disgustingly\nagainst his eyes and\nmouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\narms before his face he jumped\nup and backwards, away from\nthe bugs. As he did so, a dark\nshapeless thing plopped from\nthe trees onto the spot where he\nhad been lying stretched out.\nThen, like an ambient fungus,\nit slithered off into the jungle\nundergrowth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a split second the jungle\nstood frozen in a brilliant blue\nflash, followed by the sharp report\nof a blaster. Then another.\nAlan whirled, startled. The\nplanet's double moon had risen\nand he could see a robot rolling\nslowly across the clearing in his\ngeneral direction, blasting indiscriminately\nat whatever mind\nimpulses came within its pickup\nrange, birds, insects, anything.\nSix or seven others also left the\ncamp headquarters area and\nheaded for the jungle, each to a\nslightly different spot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apparently the robot hadn't\nsensed him yet, but Alan didn't\nknow what the effective range\nof its pickup devices was. He\nbegan to slide back into the\njungle. Minutes later, looking\nback he saw that the machine,\nthough several hundred yards\naway, had altered its course and\nwas now headed directly for\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His stomach tightened. Panic.\nThe dank, musty smell of the\njungle seemed for an instant to\nthicken and choke in his throat.\nThen he thought of the big ship\nlanding in the morning, settling\ndown slowly after a lonely two-week\nvoyage. He thought of a\nbrown-haired girl crowding with\nthe others to the gangway, eager\nto embrace the new planet, and\nthe next instant a charred nothing,\nunrecognizable, the victim\nof a design error or a misplaced\nwire in a machine. \"I have to\ntry,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\ntry.\" He moved into the blackness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Powerful as a small tank, the\nkiller robot was equipped to\ncrush, slash, and burn its way\nthrough undergrowth. Nevertheless,\nit was slowed by the\nlarger trees and the thick, clinging\nvines, and Alan found that\nhe could manage to keep ahead\nof it, barely out of blaster range.\nOnly, the robot didn't get tired.\nAlan did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\nshadows that wavered\nand danced across the jungle\nfloor, hiding debris that tripped\nhim and often sent him sprawling\ninto the dark. Sharp-edged\ngrowths tore at his face and\nclothes, and insects attracted by\nthe blood matted against his\npants and shirt. Behind, the robot\ncrashed imperturbably after\nhim, lighting the night with fitful\nblaster flashes as some\nwinged or legged life came within\nits range.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was movement also, in\nthe darkness beside him, scrapings\nand rustlings and an occasional\nlow, throaty sound like an\nangry cat. Alan's fingers tensed\non his pocket blaster. Swift\nshadowy forms moved quickly in\nthe shrubs and the growling became\nsuddenly louder. He fired\ntwice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\nSharp screams punctuated\nthe electric blue discharge as\na pack of small feline creatures\nleaped snarling and clawing\nback into the night.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Mentally, Alan tried to figure\nthe charge remaining in his blaster.\nThere wouldn't be much.\n\"Enough for a few more shots,\nmaybe. Why the devil didn't I\nload in fresh cells this morning!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robot crashed on, louder\nnow, gaining on the tired human.\nLegs aching and bruised,\nstinging from insect bites, Alan\ntried to force himself to run\nholding his hands in front of\nhim like a child in the dark. His\nfoot tripped on a barely visible\ninsect hill and a winged swarm\nexploded around him. Startled,\nAlan jerked sideways, crashing\nhis head against a tree. He\nclutched at the bark for a second,\ndazed, then his knees\nbuckled. His blaster fell into the\nshadows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The robot crashed loudly behind\nhim now. Without stopping\nto think, Alan fumbled along the\nground after his gun, straining\nhis eyes in the darkness. He\nfound it just a couple of feet to\none side, against the base of a\nsmall bush. Just as his fingers\nclosed upon the barrel his other\nhand slipped into something\nsticky that splashed over his\nforearm. He screamed in pain\nand leaped back, trying frantically\nto wipe the clinging,\nburning blackness off his arm.\nPatches of black scraped off onto\nbranches and vines, but the rest\nspread slowly over his arm as\nagonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\nbeing ripped away layer by\nlayer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\nAlan stumbled forward.\nSharp muscle spasms shot from\nhis shoulder across his back and\nchest. Tears streamed across his\ncheeks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A blue arc slashed at the trees\na mere hundred yards behind.\nHe screamed at the blast. \"Damn\nyou, Pete! Damn your robots!\nDamn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\nHe stepped into emptiness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\nby the water, the pain began to\nfall away. He wanted to lie there\nforever in the dark, cool, wetness.\nFor ever, and ever, and ...\nThe air thundered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the dim light he could see\nthe banks of the stream, higher\nthan a man, muddy and loose.\nGrowing right to the edge of the\nbanks, the jungle reached out\nwith hairy, disjointed arms as\nif to snag even the dirty little\nstream that passed so timidly\nthrough its domain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alan, lying in the mud of the\nstream bed, felt the earth shake\nas the heavy little robot rolled\nslowly and inexorably towards\nhim. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\nhe thought, \"in battle\ndress.\" He tried to stand but his\nlegs were almost too weak and\nhis arm felt numb. \"I'll drown\nhim,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown\nthe Lord High Executioner.\" He\nlaughed. Then his mind cleared.\nHe remembered where he was.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Alan trembled. For the first\ntime in his life he understood\nwhat it was to live, because for\nthe first time he realized that he\nwould sometime die. In other\ntimes and circumstances he\nmight put it off for a while, for\nmonths or years, but eventually,\nas now, he would have to watch,\nstill and helpless, while death\ncame creeping. Then, at thirty,\nAlan became a man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Dammit, no law says I have\nto flame-out\n  <i>\n   now\n  </i>\n  !\" He forced\nhimself to rise, forced his legs\nto stand, struggling painfully in\nthe shin-deep ooze. He worked\nhis way to the bank and began to\ndig frenziedly, chest high, about\ntwo feet below the edge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His arm where the black thing\nhad been was swollen and tender,\nbut he forced his hands to dig,\ndig, dig, cursing and crying to\nhide the pain, and biting his\nlips, ignoring the salty taste of\nblood. The soft earth crumbled\nunder his hands until he had a\nsmall cave about three feet deep\nin the bank. Beyond that the\nsoil was held too tightly by the\nroots from above and he had to\nstop.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  The air crackled blue and a\ntree crashed heavily past Alan\ninto the stream. Above him on\nthe bank, silhouetting against\nthe moons, the killer robot stopped\nand its blaster swivelled\nslowly down. Frantically, Alan\nhugged the bank as a shaft of\npure electricity arced over him,\nsliced into the water, and exploded\nin a cloud of steam. The\nrobot shook for a second, its\nblaster muzzle lifted erratically\nand for an instant it seemed almost\nout of control, then it\nquieted and the muzzle again\npointed down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pressing with all his might,\nAlan slid slowly along the bank\ninches at a time, away from the\nmachine above. Its muzzle turned\nto follow him but the edge of\nthe bank blocked its aim. Grinding\nforward a couple of feet,\nslightly overhanging the bank,\nthe robot fired again. For a split\nsecond Alan seemed engulfed in\nflame; the heat of hell singed his\nhead and back, and mud boiled\nin the bank by his arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again the robot trembled. It\njerked forward a foot and its\nblaster swung slightly away. But\nonly for a moment. Then the gun\nswung back again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly, as if sensing something\nwrong, its tracks slammed\ninto reverse. It stood poised for\na second, its treads spinning\ncrazily as the earth collapsed underneath\nit, where Alan had\ndug, then it fell with a heavy\nsplash into the mud, ten feet\nfrom where Alan stood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without hesitation Alan\nthrew himself across the blaster\nhousing, frantically locking his\narms around the barrel as the\nrobot's treads churned furiously\nin the sticky mud, causing it to\nbuck and plunge like a Brahma\nbull. The treads stopped and the\nblaster jerked upwards wrenching\nAlan's arms, then slammed\ndown. Then the whole housing\nwhirled around and around, tilting\nalternately up and down like\na steel-skinned water monster\ntrying to dislodge a tenacious\ncrab, while Alan, arms and legs\nwrapped tightly around the blaster\nbarrel and housing, pressed\nfiercely against the robot's metal\nskin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly, trying to anticipate\nand shift his weight with the\nspinning plunges, Alan worked\nhis hand down to his right hip.\nHe fumbled for the sheath clipped\nto his belt, found it, and extracted\na stubby hunting knife.\nSweat and blood in his eyes,\nhardly able to move on the wildly\nswinging turret, he felt down\nthe sides to the thin crack between\nthe revolving housing and\nthe stationary portion of the robot.\nWith a quick prayer he\njammed in the knife blade—and\nwas whipped headlong into the\nmud as the turret literally snapped\nto a stop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The earth, jungle and moons\nspun in a pinwheeled blur,\nslowed, and settled to their proper\nplaces. Standing in the sticky,\nsweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\nthe robot apprehensively. Half\nburied in mud, it stood quiet in\nthe shadowy light except for an\noccasional, almost spasmodic\njerk of its blaster barrel. For\nthe first time that night Alan\nallowed himself a slight smile.\n\"A blade in the old gear box,\neh? How does that feel, boy?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He turned. \"Well, I'd better\nget out of here before the knife\nslips or the monster cooks up\nsome more tricks with whatever\nit's got for a brain.\" Digging\nlittle footholds in the soft bank,\nhe climbed up and stood once\nagain in the rustling jungle\ndarkness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\nPete could cram enough brain\ninto one of those things to make\nit hunt and track so perfectly.\"\nHe tried to visualize the computing\ncircuits needed for the\noperation of its tracking mechanism\nalone. \"There just isn't\nroom for the electronics. You'd\nneed a computer as big as the\none at camp headquarters.\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  In the distance the sky blazed\nas a blaster roared in the jungle.\nThen Alan heard the approaching\nrobot, crunching and snapping\nits way through the undergrowth\nlike an onrushing forest\nfire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\nThey communicate with each\nother! The one I jammed must\nbe calling others to help.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He began to move along the\nbank, away from the crashing\nsounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\neyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\nI'll bet anything they're\nautomatically controlled by the\ncamp computer. That's where\ntheir brain is!\" He paused.\n\"Then, if that were put out of\ncommission ...\" He jerked away\nfrom the bank and half ran, half\npulled himself through the undergrowth\ntowards the camp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trees exploded to his left as\nanother robot fired in his direction,\ntoo far away to be effective\nbut churning towards him\nthrough the blackness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alan changed direction slightly\nto follow a line between the\ntwo robots coming up from\neither side, behind him. His eyes\nwere well accustomed to the dark\nnow, and he managed to dodge\nmost of the shadowy vines and\nbranches before they could snag\nor trip him. Even so, he stumbled\nin the wiry underbrush and\nhis legs were a mass of stinging\nslashes from ankle to thigh.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crashing rumble of the\nkiller robots shook the night behind\nhim, nearer sometimes,\nthen falling slightly back, but\nfollowing constantly, more\nunshakable than bloodhounds\nbecause a man can sometimes cover\na scent, but no man can stop his\nthoughts. Intermittently, like\nphotographers' strobes, blue\nflashes would light the jungle\nabout him. Then, for seconds\nafterwards his eyes would see\ndancing streaks of yellow and\nsharp multi-colored pinwheels\nthat alternately shrunk and expanded\nas if in a surrealist's\nnightmare. Alan would have to\npause and squeeze his eyelids\ntight shut before he could see\nagain, and the robots would\nmove a little closer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To his right the trees silhouetted\nbriefly against brilliance as\na third robot slowly moved up\nin the distance. Without thinking,\nAlan turned slightly to the\nleft, then froze in momentary\npanic. \"I should be at the camp\nnow. Damn, what direction am\nI going?\" He tried to think\nback, to visualize the twists and\nturns he'd taken in the jungle.\n\"All I need is to get lost.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He pictured the camp computer\nwith no one to stop it, automatically\nsending its robots in\nwider and wider forays, slowly\nwiping every trace of life from\nthe planet. Technologically advanced\nmachines doing the job\nfor which they were built, completely,\nthoroughly, without feeling,\nand without human masters\nto separate sense from futility.\nFinally parts would wear out,\ncircuits would short, and one by\none the killers would crunch to\na halt. A few birds would still\nfly then, but a unique animal\nlife, rare in the universe, would\nexist no more. And the bones of\nchildren, eager girls, and their\nmen would also lie, beside a\nrusty hulk, beneath the alien\nsun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Peggy!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  As if in answer, a tree beside\nhim breathed fire, then exploded.\nIn the brief flash of the\nblaster shot, Alan saw the steel\nglint of a robot only a hundred\nyards away, much nearer than\nhe had thought. \"Thank heaven\nfor trees!\" He stepped back, felt\nhis foot catch in something,\nclutched futilely at some leaves\nand fell heavily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pain danced up his leg as he\ngrabbed his ankle. Quickly he\nfelt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\nthe rotten luck, anyway!\" He\nblinked the pain tears from his\neyes and looked up—into a robot's\nblaster, jutting out of the\nfoliage, thirty yards away.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Instinctively, in one motion\nAlan grabbed his pocket blaster\nand fired. To his amazement the\nrobot jerked back, its gun wobbled\nand started to tilt away.\nThen, getting itself under control,\nit swung back again to face\nAlan. He fired again, and again\nthe robot reacted. It seemed familiar\nsomehow. Then he remembered\nthe robot on the river\nbank, jiggling and swaying for\nseconds after each shot. \"Of\ncourse!\" He cursed himself for\nmissing the obvious. \"The blaster\nstatic blanks out radio\ntransmission from the computer\nfor a few seconds. They even do\nit to themselves!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Firing intermittently, he\npulled himself upright and hobbled\nahead through the bush.\nThe robot shook spasmodically\nwith each shot, its gun tilted upward\nat an awkward angle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\nstars, real stars brilliant in the\nnight sky, and half dragging his\nswelling leg he stumbled out of\nthe jungle into the camp clearing.\nAhead, across fifty yards of\ngrass stood the headquarters\nbuilding, housing the robot-controlling\ncomputer. Still firing at\nshort intervals he started across\nthe clearing, gritting his teeth\nat every step.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Straining every muscle in\nspite of the agonizing pain, Alan\nforced himself to a limping run\nacross the uneven ground, carefully\navoiding the insect hills\nthat jutted up through the grass.\nFrom the corner of his eye he\nsaw another of the robots standing\nshakily in the dark edge of\nthe jungle waiting, it seemed,\nfor his small blaster to run dry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Be damned! You can't win\nnow!\" Alan yelled between blaster\nshots, almost irrational from\nthe pain that ripped jaggedly\nthrough his leg. Then it happened.\nA few feet from the\nbuilding's door his blaster quit.\nA click. A faint hiss when he\nfrantically jerked the trigger\nagain and again, and the spent\ncells released themselves from\nthe device, falling in the grass\nat his feet. He dropped the useless\ngun.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No!\" He threw himself on\nthe ground as a new robot suddenly\nappeared around the edge\nof the building a few feet away,\naimed, and fired. Air burned\nover Alan's back and ozone tingled\nin his nostrils.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Blinding itself for a few seconds\nwith its own blaster static,\nthe robot paused momentarily,\njiggling in place. In this\ninstant, Alan jammed his hands\ninto an insect hill and hurled the\npile of dirt and insects directly\nat the robot's antenna. In a flash,\nhundreds of the winged things\nerupted angrily from the hole in\na swarming cloud, each part of\nwhich was a speck of life\ntransmitting mental energy to the\nrobot's pickup devices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Confused by the sudden dispersion\nof mind impulses, the\nrobot fired erratically as Alan\ncrouched and raced painfully for\nthe door. It fired again, closer,\nas he fumbled with the lock\nrelease. Jagged bits of plastic and\nstone ripped past him, torn loose\nby the blast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Frantically, Alan slammed\nopen the door as the robot, sensing\nhim strongly now, aimed\npoint blank. He saw nothing, his\nmind thought of nothing but the\nred-clad safety switch mounted\nbeside the computer. Time stopped.\nThere was nothing else in\nthe world. He half-jumped, half-fell\ntowards it, slowly, in tenths\nof seconds that seemed measured\nout in years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The universe went black.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Later. Brilliance pressed upon\nhis eyes. Then pain returned, a\nmulti-hurting thing that crawled\nthrough his body and dragged\nragged tentacles across his\nbrain. He moaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A voice spoke hollowly in the\ndistance. \"He's waking. Call his\nwife.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alan opened his eyes in a\nwhite room; a white light hung\nover his head. Beside him, looking\ndown with a rueful smile,\nstood a young man wearing\nspace medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\nhe acknowledged the question in\nAlan's eyes, \"you hit the switch.\nThat was three days ago. When\nyou're up again we'd all like to\nthank you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\ngreen-eyed girl was pressed\ntightly against him. Neither of\nthem spoke. They couldn't. There\nwas too much to say.\n </p>\n <p class=\"theend\">\n  THE END\n </p>\n <b>\n  Transcriber's Note:\n </b>\n <br/>\n This etext was produced from\n <i>\n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n </i>\n October 1958.

He loses his footing and trips, realizing that there is a possibility of blaster fighting. He hurries to mark an X on a tree for his position and heads back to the clearing of the temporary camp site. This place is home to the only eleven humans, with Alan, on the planet of Waiamea. Once Alan returns to the site, he observes the killer robots and praises Pete for getting them to work. However, when the robots turn on him, he realizes that the robots must have been programmed to pick up human brain waves. He thinks back to Penny, a girl he married three weeks ago who will be arriving with the rest of the colonists tomorrow. This becomes his reason to live against the killer robots, and he observes the killer robots. He fires into the undergrowth and berates himself for not loading fresh cells in the morning as the robot gets louder. He is injured by one and cries out as he feels himself dying. As the robot comes towards him again, he understands what it means to live and forces himself to keep walking. Alan then hugs the bank as pure electricity arches over him, sliding slowly and away from the machine above. The robot trembles and suddenly falls; this gives Alan an opportunity to tackle it. The two struggle, but Alan takes a hunting knife out and jams it into the robot. He wonders how Pete managed to create these robots so perfectly. Suddenly, he hears an approaching robot and realizes that they communicate with each other even if one of them is jammed. Alan decides to run towards the camp because he realizes that’s where the brain of the robots is located. Shortly after running, he finds himself lost because the camp has not appeared in sight yet. He tries to think back to where the camp could be and narrowly misses getting blasted by one of the killer robots. When he fires the pocket blaster, it cancels out the radio transmission from the computer to the robot; Alan sees this as an opportunity to go towards the headquarters building. His blaster suddenly quits, but he manages to hurl a pile of dirt and insects at the robots. He goes into the room quickly as the robot continues to blast. The robot aims point blank at him as he hurls himself towards the red-clad safety switch. Everything then fades to black. When Alan wakes up again, there is a young man wearing a medical insignia telling him that he had hit the switch three days ago. Suddenly, his wife appears, and they hold each other tight.

While being on a walk in the jungle, Alan, one of the colonists that just landed, hears strange noises. After walking back, he realizes that the killer robots, that his friend was building and whose main goal was to pick up animals’ and dangerous predators’ brain activity and kill them, have been programmed in a wrong way, and now they are aiming at every living creature, including humans. He sees that the other colonists in the camp were already killed, and Alan himself is accidentally saved by a predator who attacks the robot aiming at him. The metal killers are now moving around the territory, guarding it, and trying to pick up somebody’s brain waves. Remembering his wife Peggy and everyone else who was going to land on the next day, Alan decides to at least try to fight the robots and prevent them from killing everybody on this approaching ship. He runs through the jungle, bruising his arms and legs, getting bitten by insects, and manages to temporarily disable the robot by half-drowning him in the river and stabbing his metal corpus with a knife. When he hears the other robots approaching the river he realizes that they must be connected by radio and, thus, are controlled by the main computer in the camp’s headquarters. He runs back to the camp, firing with his blaster which slows down the robots a little bit. Thinking about the importance of the human species and overcoming excruciating throbbing pain in his limbs, Alan gets to the camp. He runs out of blaster cells but makes his way to the computer room.

I had finished reading the\n  <i>\n   Chronicle\n  </i>\n  , folded and put\nit beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the\nSan Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I\nreturned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed\ngray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats\nbefore me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now\nshe had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and\ncalf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a\nwindow where there was nothing to see.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a\ntogetherness-type-magazine reader.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I\nshould be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles\nfor, and not wanting to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps\nthat sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever\ncomplained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore\nthe insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers\nand—well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.\nIt's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from\nelectric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me\n  <i>\n   how\n  </i>\n  they hurt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always\nknew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and\ntherefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel\nthe color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the\nsame as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell\nif there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just\nthe feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to\nbecome pretty good at guessing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object\nin her purse with waxlike stuff inside it—a lipstick. A round, hard\nobject with dust inside—a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small\nbook, probably an address book, money in a change purse—a few bills\nand coins. Not much else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.\nBut I never say anything.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when\nMiss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat\nmy sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some\nof the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.\nLunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd\nbe gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during\nher absence, which I dutifully did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for\nher favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and\nlooking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while\nshe was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which\nshe always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was sent home with a stinging note.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able\nto sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other\npeople are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but\nhow? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the\nthings I sense in probing really are.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A\nfeather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or\nheat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's\nwindow. And I can stop clocks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty\nbecause I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco\nInternational Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it\nseems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement\nand balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last\ntime I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the\npawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its\ndelicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting\ninfluence to decrease the restoring torque.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite\na bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I\ncan't stand the alarm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went\nto Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls\nand cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate\nabout a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped\nquite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that\nit amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out\nthe window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her\nwe were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced\nat her wristwatch and sank back again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I\ncontented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about\nAmos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement\nchain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were\nmaybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind\nwandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of\nluggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through\nslips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a\nukulele.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  The bomb was in a small bag—a woman's bag judging by the soft,\nflimsy things you'd never find in a man's—and I didn't know it was a\nbomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,\nquiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me\nwas that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be\nelectrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more\nclosely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard\nround cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my\nneck when I suddenly realized what it was.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past\nthe train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own\nalarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around\nat the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I\nthought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was\nthere. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.\nWe'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles\nsoon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But of course that had been the plan!\n </p>\n <p>\n  My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind\nwas numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd\nthink I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be\npanic and they'd never get the plane down in time—if they believed me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,\nsmiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small\npaper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped\ndoughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a\nnapkin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd\nlook and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at\nthe cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent\na frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that\nbalance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried\nto close everything off—the throb of engines, the rush of air, the\nwoman sipping coffee noisily beside me—and I went into the clock and\nsurrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;\nwhen it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was\nlike trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going\nto be able to stop it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not\nafford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold\nuntil it came to a dead stop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Anything the matter?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to\nme. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was\nstill chewing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back\nand forth.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When\nshe came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,\njust coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy\nwith sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to\nthe landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would\nstart again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.\nI considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe\ncalling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.\nMaybe I could convince them I could stop a clock—but not before the\nbomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would\nbe changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man\nliterally with gimlet eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of\nthe city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,\nbut there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it\nwas also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing\nmy eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging\nand pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I\nlooked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took\nit without a word and went away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to\nfits, but I didn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest\nminutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when\nthe plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as\nunconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking\nthrough the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I\nhad my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.\nSo I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and\nwatch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield\ncarts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained\nthe bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The\nassortment of bags—a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors—was\npacked in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where\nI was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the\nbalance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a\nramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded\nand placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,\nand a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to\ndetermine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was\nthe attendant and I had two bags—my own battered veteran of years, and\na fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and—a\nclock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward\nand grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I\nentered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to\nimmobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I\nstared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented\nit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I\nwas ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with\nhis eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it\ntoward me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the\nremaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But\nhe was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance\nand put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying\nover.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Cab?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage\nclaim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran\nthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied\nme.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a\nman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing\nsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could\nI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the\nbag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to\nlive with myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until—until\nwhat?\n </p>\n <p>\n  A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of\nthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a\npair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could\ntell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the\nwhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own\nbusiness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started\nacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,\n\"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But\nI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim\ncounter out of the side of my eye.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp\nto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went\ninside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag\non the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The\nclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How\nmany minutes—or seconds—were left? I was sweating when I moved to the\ncounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I\nhad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the\nclock again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the\ncounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the\ndevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel\nescaped my grasp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood\nthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand\nshe had a green baggage claim check.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight\ncase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,\nglanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying\nafter her.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, \"Listen to me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a matter of life or death,\" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag\nfrom her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I\nrestrained myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled\nsuitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,\n\"Please put the bag down. Over there.\" I indicated a spot beside a\ntelephone booth where it would be out of the way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She didn't move. She just said, \"Why?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"For God's sake!\" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her\nbag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing\nthere looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue\nand brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,\nI'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me\nor anything else right now if it had.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I've got to talk to you. It's very important.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The girl said, \"Why?\" I was beginning to think it was the only word she\nknew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill\nsomeone so lovely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a\ntelephone call.\" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, \"And\ndon't ask me why.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She gave me a speculative look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, \"All right,\nbut—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,\npretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in\nthere, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this\nrange it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Now will you please tell me what this is all about?\" she said stiffly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed\nthe short, fat man into the coffee shop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory\nability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and\nhow I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew\npale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears\nthere when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but\nstaring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes\nshe was reliving some recent scene.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Who is Joe?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got\ncontrol again. \"This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my\nsister.\" Her smile was bleak. \"I see now why he wanted to put in those\nbooks. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put\nin some books we'd both finished reading—for my sister. That's when he\nmust have put the—put it in there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was\nclose to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I\nwant to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's all right now?\" she asked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been\nthinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the\nairport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl—she said her\nname was Julia Claremont—agreed to tell him she thought there was a\nbomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried\nbecause she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it\nwould have to do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for\nhis coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.\nI asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other\npeople had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy\nfor a long while.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.\nShe said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled\na little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all\nfor me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again\nwhen we reached the lobby.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two bags weren't there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered\nsuitcase?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just\nstepped out of here—\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,\nmine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came\nabreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door\nand threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I\nreached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then\nwalked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the\nredcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That he did,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the\nparking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get\nover to the office.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant\nshattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to\nme.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe\nin the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That\nwas all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was\nthinking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I—I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't\nbother to report it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't\n  <i>\n   make\n  </i>\n  you report it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some\nair. Can't we walk a little?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Sure,\" I said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill\nwith the distant sounds of sirens.\n </p>\n\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "109", "uid": "d951e09dfc734bc08b8758b2dfbe6dd2", "response_text": "On a seemingly normal flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles sits our protagonist, on his way to complete a printing order. In his initial musings, we find out that his curiosity and intuition about his fellow passengers come out of his extrasensory ability to see inside objects and human beings. The protagonist is also revealed to be able to manipulate time by stopping clocks, which he uses to his benefit with early wake-up calls. Despite his unique abilities, he laments that it renders largely useless and mundane as it often ruins surprises like Christmas gifts, requires a bit of guessing, and fails to work as gimmicks in manipulating games like Vegas slot machines. \n\nAnd so with his seemingly useless but curious gaze, the protagonist ponders about his seat-mate’s purse, Amos Magaffey the purchasing agent, and rifling through luggages and identifying his own. All of sudden, his musings are halted by the discovery of a bomb in one of the luggages, with a countdown timer ticking with 10 minutes or less. The flight is still 40 minutes away from its destination and so with great effort and increasing suspicion from his seat-mate, the protagonist uses his ability to stop the ticking bomb. The flight lands safely with the bomb remaining inactivated, but the protgaonist now worries between alerting authorities - which may cast suspicion upon himself - or follow the luggage and identify who picks it up. With no one initially picking up the luggage with the bomb - the little red bag - it is delivered by the flight attendant to the rear room. Soon, a young lady arrives to pick it up. It is then that the protagonist hurries over to her in hopes of warning her of the ticking time bomb. It turns out that the likely culprit of planting the bomb is the young lady’s - Julia Claremont - husband, whose motives are unknown but nevertheless unhinged. Armed with this information and a false story about the bag’s suspicion, the pair decides to approach an airport policeman and inform them of the bomb. However, as they return to where they left their bags, they find that both his and Julia’s luggages have been stolen by a strange man entering his grey vehicle. Turning to the airport policeman in reporting this stolen luggage, they are interrupted by an explosion in a grey vehicle. Shocked and somber, Julia and the protagonist inform the policeman that they no longer wish to report the stolen luggage, and the two begin to walk away from the airport. \n"}, {"worker_id": "113", "uid": "0a53b3c2f9524b75926a004ea5aba4dd", "response_text": "The protagonist and narrator of the story is a man who long ago discovered that he had an extraordinary ability: sensing the contents of different objects, like boxes and bags, and moving light things, like feathers or a watch balance wheel, without touching them. He got in trouble for naively using his gift in the fourth grade and has kept quiet about it ever since. At the beginning of the story, he is on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles for a business meeting with an amusement chain owner. After studying the passengers around him, checking the window view, and mentally looking through the purse of a woman next to him, he decides to find his suitcase in the luggage compartment of the plane. The narrator is going through the content of other people’s suitcases when he feels something resembling a bomb. It seems to be inside a small woman’s bag and is about to go off in ten minutes, but the plane is supposed to land only in forty. Anxious and hectic, he refuses the cup of coffee from a stewardess and decides that he has to stop the clock mechanism, at least for the duration of the flight. He does it every morning with his alarm, so it doesn’t seem impossible. After temporarily stopping it, his thoughts race ahead to the landing, realizing that he wouldn’t be able to control the mechanism forever or tell the truth to the police. But his thinking process is disturbed by turbulence - he realizes that the balance wheel is moving again. After some tugging, pulling, and shoving, it finally becomes immovable. When the plane lands, the protagonist goes to the baggage claim and tries to find the owner of the bag. After picking up his suitcase and watching how the claim employees take the bag with the bomb to the storage room, he finally sees a blond woman called Julia Claremont - he saw her on the flight - approaching the counter. He convinces her to put the bag down and pretends that he is speaking to someone in a telephone booth while deactivating the mechanism once again.

At the end of his monologue, she starts crying and says that her husband Joe probably put it in her bag after she had finished packing the day before. That trip was Joe’s idea, but she doesn’t know why her husband would do something like that. They go back to the gate to realize that the bags they had left there are gone.

If he does, they will only cast suspicion on him for being the one who initially put it in there.

The first setting - on the airplane mid flight - is highly important to the story because it is here that the protagonist discovered the bomb in the luggage. Not only that, he discovers that bomb is on a countdown with 10 minutes remaining before detonation while the flight still has 40 minutes before arrival. It is due to this fact that the protagonist utilizes his time manipulation ability to stop the clock successfully. \n\nIn the second setting, the tensions in this story continue to rise. Despite the protagonist successfully stopping the clock in the air, it appears to continue on the ground. With both the anticipation of watching to see who picks up the little red bag and dodging suspicions from the airport policeman and workers, we can imagine the hectic and panicked energy that sometimes appears in baggage claims. Additionally, an airport is filled with many people arriving and departing, which adds to the pressure the protagonist is facing in dealing with deactivating the bomb before anyone gets hurt. \n"}, {"worker_id": "113", "uid": "0a53b3c2f9524b75926a004ea5aba4dd", "response_text": "The first part of the story is happening on a plane that is flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles. When the protagonist finds the bomb in one of the bags in the luggage compartment, the plane is somewhere above the mountain range north of Los Angeles - even in theory, it is impossible to land because there are no airports around this area. He stops the clock mechanism, using his extraordinary ability. After the landing, the story continues in the building of the airport, where the protagonist finds the owner of the bag with the bomb - Julia Claremont. He tells her about the bomb and how he sensed it during the flight. She cries and tells him that her husband put it in her bag after she had finished packing. They go back to the lobby and see that their suitcases got stolen. The protagonist tries to chase the thief, but the man quickly drives off with the bags. When they decide to file a report, something explodes loudly near the airport, and Julia, together with the protagonist, walks away, refusing to report the theft. \n"}, {"worker_id": "107", "uid": "82d4aff5b2c4454ab8640054a18ca313", "response_text": "The story first begins on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

It is forty minutes from Burbank to Lockheed Air Terminal, and there would be no place to land the plane any time soon.

The setting of the plane is important because it is where the protagonist first discovers the bomb. Without his extraordinary ability to feel around any enclosed object, he would not be able to detect and temporarily stop the bomb’s timer before it was too late. This is also significant because the plane would have exploded had he not found it. The airport is important too because that is where he meets Julia.

More importantly, informing them is the right thing to do and would save the lives of everyone else at the airport.

If the protagonist were to approach the policeman in a suspicious manner or reveal too much information about his know-how of the bomb, it is likely that they will suspect him to be the culprit and probe him on something he is unable to explain, and hence arrest him.

He could not quite explain the\nfeelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since\nthe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,\nfrom the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his\nlife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had\ngrown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This\ndisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had\nrealized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside\nhim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today, space looked somehow different. The stars—it was a meaningless\nconcept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright\npinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport—were not\napparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead,\nthere was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart\nby itself in the middle of the viewport.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was\nodd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was—it was—what\nwas it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and\ngreeted gray-haired old Chuls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you'll be ready to sire\nchildren. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the\nhealth-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it;\nhe just didn't, without comprehending.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the\ntime he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select\nas his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud\nignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling\nhe could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man\nhad? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always\nembroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a\nheadache?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here\nand knew it was your time, too....\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not\nexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had\ndeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'll go with you,\" Rikud told him.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of the\nhealth-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the ray\ntubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacant\ntube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watch\nthe one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growing\nlarger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and a\nmetallic voice said. \"Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoy\nhim. Now why shouldn't a man be permitted to do what he wanted, when\nhe wanted to do it?\n  <i>\n   There\n  </i>\n  was a strange thought, and Rikud's brain\nwhirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions and\nunsatisfactory answers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever got\nhurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl\nhimself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen.\nBut something soft had cushioned the impact—something which had come\ninto being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-being\nagain, something which was as impalpable as air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no real\nauthority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt that\nthere should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machine\nin the library had told him of the elders—a meaningless term—who had\ngoverned the world. They told you to do something and you did it, but\nthat was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You only\nlistened to the buzzer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said.\nThere had been a revolt—again a term without any real meaning, a term\nthat could have no reality outside of the reading machine—and the\nelders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The people\nhad decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, and\nthat it was unfair that the elders alone had this authority. They were\nborn and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like little\ncogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, but\nhe knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with the\npeople against the elders, and it said the people had won.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he\nhad to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see the\nlook of easy contentment on Chuls' face as the rays fanned down upon\nhim, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations\nbefore Rikud's time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge of\nmedicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old\nage, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud\noften thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future,\nnot without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only\na decade to go.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under the tube at Rikud's left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavy\nthrough the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every time\nRikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True,\nthis was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it\nproved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he saw\nCrifer limp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Now Crifer said, \"I've been reading again, Rikud.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes?\" Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with the\nsmell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it\nmeant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the\nlibrary and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat\nabout and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the\npeople ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it\nwas always the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes,\" said Crifer. \"I found a book about the stars. They're also\ncalled astronomy, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one\nelbow. \"What did you find out?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, where's the book?\" Rikud would read it tomorrow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I left it in the library. You can find several of them under\n'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous\nterms.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You know,\" Rikud said, sitting up now, \"the stars in the viewport are\nchanging.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Changing?\" Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he\nquestioned what it might mean in this particular case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the\nothers.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Astronomy says some stars are variable,\" Crifer offered, but Rikud\nknew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he\ndid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. \"Variability,\" he told\nthem, \"is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I'm only saying what I read in the book,\" Crifer protested mildly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words without\nmeaning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"People grow old,\" Rikud suggested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and\nChuls said, \"It's almost time for me to eat.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the two\nconcepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago,\nbut now it faded, and change and old were just two words.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange\nfeeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the\nviewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of the\nworld, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman.\nHe had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly\nremembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed;\nthis was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings—strange\nchannelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the\nstars again.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  The view had changed, and the strangeness of it made Rikud's pulses\nleap with excitement. All the stars were paler now than before, and\nwhere Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of\nlight, white with a tinge of blue in it, and so bright that it hurt his\neyes to look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to\nturn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed\nto control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white\nglobe—if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There\nwas that word change again. Didn't it have something to do with age?\nRikud couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's\nbook on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was\nvariable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer,\nand he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that\nhe couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his\neyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them.\nBut the new view persisted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone,\ntoo, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge\nthat it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and\nround, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud\nhad no name.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section\nof it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the\nviewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the\nmiddle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green,\nand on the other, blue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world\nhad ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular\nintervals by a sharp booming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Change—\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Won't you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I'll eat. Later.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's time....\" Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him,\nand for a while he struggled with it. What he saw—what he had always\nseen, except that now there was the added factor of change—perhaps did\nnot exist\n  <i>\n   in\n  </i>\n  the viewport.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe it existed\n  <i>\n   through\n  </i>\n  the viewport.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see\nnothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more\nconfusing than ever.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of\nvapor. \"What do you see?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What else?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Else? Nothing.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do\nyou hear?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of\nthe engines. \"I'm hungry, Rikud.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining\nroom, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a\nmoment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world.\nBut that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And\nbesides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far\nvaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport\nwhich was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover,\ndid not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens\ndid. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept\nit as fact. There—through the viewport and in it—was a garden. A\ngarden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had\nnever seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the\nworld's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless,\nit was a garden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\"\nhe admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could\nnot tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the\nviewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking—the\nword seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless\nit were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere\nwas the garden and the world had arrived.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants\nare different.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then they've changed?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No, merely different.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, what about the viewport?\n  <i>\n   It\n  </i>\n  changed. Where are the stars?\nWhere are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The stars come out at night.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"So there is a change from day to night!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they\nshine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Once they shone all the time.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\"\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on\nastronomy. He hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the\nreading machine had begun to bore him. He said, \"Well, variable or not,\nour whole perspective has changed.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only\nthe man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so\nobvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another,\nit was with a purpose—to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the\nhealth-rays. Now if the world had walked from—somewhere, through the\nvast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also\nwas purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But\nif everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could\nthey find the nature of that purpose?\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Damn the man, all he did was eat!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because\nhe was hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Rikud, too, was hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Differently.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and\nnow, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading\nmachine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the\ndoor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean\n  <i>\n   through\n  </i>\n  the door.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Yes.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened\nit. It's only a door.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I will,\" said Rikud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You will what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think so.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?\nThere's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No—\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of\nbreath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,\nand Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other\nend of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,\nRikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He missed the beginning, but then:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   —therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this\ndoor. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the\nrigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may\nhave discarded it for something better—who knows? But if you have\nnot, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship\nis a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is\nhuman-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not\npermit it—within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and\nto avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be\npermitted through this door—\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing\nwords. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting\nthan that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another\nvoice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle\nhumming, punctuated by a\n  <i>\n   throb-throb-throb\n  </i>\n  which sounded not unlike\nthe booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't\nblast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's\neyes—he blinked and looked again, but it was still there—cogs and\ngears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because\nthey shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but\nno one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might\nexist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one\nopened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The\nviewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,\nalthough it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography\nwas different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had\nthought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way\noff in the distance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his\nhand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new\nviewport. He began to turn the handle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then he trembled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What would he do out in the garden?\n </p>\n <p>\n  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly\nthought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud\ncouldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt\ndry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back\nthrough the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally\nthrough the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did\nnot dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and\nsweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the\ngarden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could\nwalk and then might find himself in the garden.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was so big.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to\ntalk about his experience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all\ninterested, yet the lame-footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with\nthe situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable\nand Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that\nbook on astronomy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. \"There are not that many doors in\nthe world,\" he said. \"The library has a door and there is a door to the\nwomen's quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through\nthat. But there are no others.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. \"Now, by\nthe world, there are two other doors!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What are you doing that for?\" demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than\nCrifer, but had no lame foot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Doing what?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble\nhearing you.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Maybe yelling will make him understand.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig.\n\"Why don't we go see?\" he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Well, I won't go,\" Chuls replied. \"There's no reason to go. If Rikud\nhas been imagining things, why should I?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I imagined nothing. I'll show you—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"You'll show me nothing because I won't go.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what\nhe did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at\nthe blouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop that,\" said the older man, mildly.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Crifer hopped up and down. \"Look what Rikud's doing! I don't know what\nhe's doing, but look. He's holding Chuls' blouse.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Stop that,\" repeated Chuls, his face reddening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Only if you'll go with me.\" Rikud was panting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls tugged at his wrist. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of\nthem watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud\nholding Chuls' blouse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"I think I can do that,\" declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer's\nshirt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each\npartner grabbing for his companion's blouse. They giggled and laughed\nand some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, \"Time to retire.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his\nthroat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What\nwould have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things\npunctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the\nbuzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd like it,\nthough. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big\ngarden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be afraid because he\ncould huddle close to them and he wouldn't be alone.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the\nmachinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears\nspinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he\nbegan to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears,\nwould the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he\nwas clearly an \"unauthorized person.\" He had heard the voice again\nupon entering the room.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as\nwide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that\nheld it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he\nswung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding,\ncrashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled\nunder his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not\ncasual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud\nsmashed everything in sight.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room\nwas a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first,\nbut presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in\nhis ears because now the throbbing had stopped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller\nviewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain\nbeneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone\nclearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that\ndoor. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once,\nwhen he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the\ndarkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whimpering, he fled.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did\nnot sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to\neat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the\nwhimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the\nsmooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run\nany more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chuls said, over and over, \"I'm hungry.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied\nconfidently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It won't any more,\" Rikud said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"What won't?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad\nthing you did, Rikud.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the\nstars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there\nbeyond the viewport.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"That's ridiculous,\" Chuls said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can\neat. I hate Rikud, I think.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I\nhate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with\nhim and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have\nhad a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's\nquarters. Did women eat?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a\nfrond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the\nplants in the viewport would even be better.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won't.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you,\ntoo, to show you how it is to be broken.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"We must go outside—through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd\ngurgling sound his stomach made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard\nCrifer's voice. \"I have Rikud's head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had\nbroken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer\nto understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face.\n\"I hit him! I hit him!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone\nwas on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and\nhe did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us\ndo to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the\ndarkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too\nweak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing\nhurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voices\nand the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run\nwas chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and\nhow big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him\nwere unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely\nand positively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He became sickly giddy thinking about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would\ndie because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and\ngrumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library,\nthrough the inner door and into the room with the voice—but the\nvoice didn't speak this time—through its door and into the place of\nmachinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and\nhe thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard\nCrifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor.\nHe felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it\nwith his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were\ncloser now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness,\nit frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those\nbehind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not\nfar away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to\nbreak him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life.\nThe garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of\nlow mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If\nplants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could\npeople. Rikud and his people\n  <i>\n   should\n  </i>\n  . This was why the world had moved\nacross the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more.\nBut he was afraid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his\nfingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head.\nSlowly he slipped to the cool floor—how his head was burning!—and for\na long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside he\nheard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on\nthe metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest:\n\"There is Rikud on the floor!\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright.\nSomething small and brown scurried across the other side of the\nviewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous\nred eyes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face\nwas so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that\neveryone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the\nmachinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal\nwhich he could see in the dim light through the open door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Where's the buzzer?\" he sobbed. \"I must find the buzzer.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, \"You broke it. You\nbroke it. And now we will break you—\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped\ndown against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps\ncame, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway.\nThen there were others, and then they were walking toward him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it\nbe variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying\nbrown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his\nstomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing\ncould live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness,\nthen so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others....\n </p>\n <p>\n  So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. And\nhis heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side of\nhis neck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where the\nblue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the row\nof mounds.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n <p>\n  Crifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, and\nsomeone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall. He kicked\nout and the hands let go, and then he turned the handle and shoved the\nweight of his body with all his strength against the door.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The air was fresh, fresher than any air Rikud had ever breathed. He\nwalked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feel\nthe floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the\nhorizon. It was all very beautiful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across\nthe land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and when\nhe got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of the\nothers followed. They stood around for a long time before going to the\nwater to drink.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n <p>\n  Rikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It was\ngood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. \"Even feelings\nare variable. I don't hate you now, Rikud.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. \"People are variable, too, Crifer.\nThat is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"They're women,\" said Crifer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completely\nhuman, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly\nexciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness.\nWith so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer,\nfrightening doors and women by appointment only.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rikud felt at home.\n </p>\n</html>\n</html>", "questions": [{"question_text": "What is the plot of the story?", "question_number": 1, "responses": [{"worker_id": "111", "uid": "f79f2525868d40058315766e1347c0da", "response_text": "The story starts off with the main character, Rikud, watching space from a viewport that is located on what seems to be a spaceship.

Old Chuls approaches him and chides him for staring at stars when he is almost ready to foster children in five years. Rikud is nervous because no other man has these thoughts about who the Calculator will select as their mate. Chuls says that it is time for his bath in the health-rays, and Rikud goes with him. When they get to the health-ray area, Rikud feels the urge to see the stars again. The machine tells him fifteen minutes under the tub. Crifer, who is in the tube on his left, brings satisfaction to Rikud through his lame foot because it is proof that the world is not perfect. Crifer tells Rikud that he has been reading about astronomy lately in the library and stars. When Rikud tells him that the stars are changing, Crifer offers that variability may contribute. He later goes to see the stars again, observing how they make his eyes hurt and are paler than before. Rikud then sees a new shape appear in the form of a big sphere.

Three or four days later, Rikud feels comfortable enough to tell Crifer about what happened. He tries to convince Chuls too and grabs his blouse.

Noting the lack of authority - the closest being the automated buzzer - he ponders the perfectness of life around him and realizes he is assured by Crifer’s limp because it demonstrated that not everything was perfect. When talking to him, Crifer reveals that he has begun reading again in lieu of the normal evening activity of chatting to other ship passengers. In return, Rikud reveals that the stars in the viewport are changing and Crifer suggests that it may be due to variability - a concept newly introduced in his book on astronomy. While Rikud and Crifer contemplate the meaning of variability and the connection between the concepts, Chuls interrupts by denouncing variability as a contradictory term. Once the buzzer sounds again, they all continue with their daily routine. \n\nAs Rikud looks again at the star, he finds that the landscape has changed to reveal a sphere with brown and green, just like the garden aboard the ship. Despite the hesitant acknowledgment and adamant denial from Crifer and Chuls respectively, they are unable to explain why the garden is in the viewpoint. Continuing with his exploration, Rikud enters through a set of doors no man has gone through. As he enters through each door, he receives warnings from the buzzer and encounters stranger noises.

Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity.

They do not understand sickness since now they can take a bath in the health rays that provide them with immunity. \n\nRikud is a 25-year-old inhabitant who enjoys looking at the viewport that shows the changing stars.

We meet him at the very beginning when he joins Rikud who stands near the viewport gazing at the stars. Together they go to the health rays’ room. While waiting for the procedure to be over, Rikud thinks about different arbitrary notions, like authority, history, human will. In the same room lies Crifer, another inhabitant of the ship. He’s short and has a lame foot which reminds Rikud of the world’s imperfection. Crifer says that he found an interesting book about astronomy during his visit to the reading room. Rikud says that stars may be changing and Crifer claims that the book mentioned their variability, Chuls protests but their conversation ends quickly. Later, Rikud, during his visits to the viewport,  witnesses a rapid change in the stars, their form, location, and even experiences a novel feeling of pain while looking at one of them without breaks. Amazed, Rikud stands there and asks Chuls about the differences in the viewport and in the sound of the engines, which, as Rikud noticed, had become quieter, but the old man gives an unsatisfying answer. Later, apparently after landing, Rikud sees a huge garden in the viewport and this image doesn’t change for a whole week. \n\nWhile visiting the reading room with Crifer, Rikud decides to open the door that he finds there.
